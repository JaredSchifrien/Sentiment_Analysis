I now enjoy watching older films to experience a different way of life. Refreshing. This film is exceptional with a wicked cast including the superb Donna Reed (criminally underrated actress and as charming and SEXY as ever) an excellent Montgomery Clift and a very funny guy in Sinatra. When the film concentrates on this trio it is a great example of Hollywood cinema at its most accomplished, unfortunately Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr also star in this. No offense, Lancaster is an adequate actor but he pulls off his lines with overwhelming hamminess and woodeness, which doesn't help when his character dialogue is so cheap and dated. Kerr is a great actress and does her best but her lines are terrible also. Those not used to films from the golden era may find this unintentionally hilarious to put it bluntly, but fortunately their little affair does not take up the majority of the film (and that music is so annoying). From Here to Eternity is not on the film same scale or spectacle as the cr@p Pearl Harbour with Affleck et al, lacking its action and explosions and explosions, but it is EXQUISITE film making and you really do feel for the characters (Lancaster and Kerr not included). See this forgotten gem and get ready for one of THE great films of the 50s. Or just see it for Donna Reeds and Monty Clifts spectacular performances.
