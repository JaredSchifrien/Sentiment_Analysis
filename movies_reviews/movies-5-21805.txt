This is without a doubt my all-time favourite film (at least until Return of the King is released). Peter Jackson took more liberty with the story in this chapter, but the heart of the story is still very evident and the movie flows perfectly. The CGI effects, particularly Gollum and Treebeard were astounding and competely believable. I was also really impressed with how Weta Digital used their Operation Massive program to create the huge scale of the Battle of Helm's Deep. The acting performances were note perfect as well...and I was particularly impressed with Viggo Mortensen. He's truly an old fashioned matinee hero in this film, who just crackles with charisma. John-Rhys Daveys was also brilliant in bringing comic relieg to the screen through Gimli...and as well provided the perfect voice for Treebeard. The only possible contention I have witht the film is the way in which Faramir's character was adapted from the book. He's much harsher in the film, and seems to lose the beautiful, peaceful wisdom that he had in the book. However his role did need to be adjusted to allow for a proper climax to the film and I guess we'll have to wait and see how he develops in the conlusion to the trilogy
