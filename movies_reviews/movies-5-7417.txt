I thought that this is one of the best romantic comedies since As Good As It Gets . It is rather coincidental that both of these films revolve somewhat around animals (the dog in As Good As It Gets and Jinxy The Cat in this film). I thoroughly enjoyed this film and laughed my tail off from start to finish- there were a lot of funny and memoriable parts that will always stick with me when I think of this film. The acting was supurb and this movie was great- anyone who thinks otherwise is just a Focker.
