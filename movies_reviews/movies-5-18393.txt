This is probably the scariest film I have ever seen. I saw this at the theater when I was twelve years old and still to this very day I can't lay eyes or ears on Zelda! (I have had so many pre-pubescent nightmares about her, it's just not funny!!!) FYI: Zelda was really played by a man and , supposedly, was married to the woman who played Rachel! Weird, huh? This has got to be one of the most depressing movies ever made as well: drab colors, innocent creatures like cats and children are suddenly evil, and everyone dies in the end!(No virginal teenage heroines to carry us into the sequel!) I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who wants a good gloomy fright and who doesn't mind seeing a skeletal, yellow monster in the guise of a woman!
