On New Year's Eve in Tehran, a 7 year old girl sets her heart on buying a pretty goldfish,but time and events seem to conspire against her.From this slight premise,aided immensely by Kiarostami's script and young Mohammedkhani's irresistible performance,director Panahi delivers a wholly absorbing and convincing child's eye view of shopkeepers,snakecharmers,soldiers and strangers,while generating a quite amazing level of suspense.New York Critics' Film of the year and winner of numerous other awards, The White Balloon is a worthy representative of Iran's magnificent contemporary cinema:a fascinating cultural insight,ideal family viewing,and a miniature delight.
