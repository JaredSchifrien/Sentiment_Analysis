Aww..everytime I think of this movie, I just smile. It's such a great movie. I own it and watch it whenever I can... you know!!! lol. Tom Cruise did a terrific job, and I don't WHO says he doesn't know how to act, the guy can freakin' act...Renee Zelweger is one of the best actresses I've ever seen perform in my whole entire life. Long live Renee!!!!!
