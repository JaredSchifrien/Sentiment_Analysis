WELCOME! To horror movie hell. Hehe. I don't have three days to spend listing the flaws of this movie so I will just brush over the top. First it is by the guy who did the equally terrible Urban Legend. His visual styling is cute and all but it can't save these poo poo scripts. The characters are all inept and unlikeable. You honestly want them all to die horrible deaths. The deaths start out good but then as if it were a kiddie film just turn into sell out deaths and leave you with dull boring and unimaginitive deaths. Like when a certain big breasted bimbo gets trepped in the hot tub by a sheet ao hard reenfirced plastic and the killer is drilling down at her the killer gives up after 15 seconds and tosses the drill into the tub, electocuting her. Whoopdy doo! Haven't seen that before. Not even haveing the beautiful work of the Deftones on the soundtrack can help this peice o trash flick out. The ending and last death is really quit funny. Go see it if you are really bored and like disapointment. Would you hide in a body bag? And if the killer began stabbing the contense of every bag in that room would you stay perfectly still or run for it? Like I said, these are some stoopid ass kids.
