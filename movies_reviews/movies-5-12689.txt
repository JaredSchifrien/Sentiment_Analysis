The best of Moore's feature films. A very dismaying and heartbreaking expose of the remorseless and uncaring nature of corporate decision making, and the failure of those supposedly in charge in the auto industry to protect their companies, their workers and the towns they operated in for the sake of the bottomline. Just shows you that it doesn't take much in the way of brains to make money, and that short-sightedness and greed in the so-called minds of our corporate leadership usually results in killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. What was truly reprehensible in this film was the absolute arrogance and self-centered attitudes of the putative leaders of town and industry. These money-grubbing scumbags should have bones rammed up their collective butts so the dogs can drag them through the streets.
