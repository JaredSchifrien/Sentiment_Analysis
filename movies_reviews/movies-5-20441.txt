I really enjoyed watching Cheerleader Massacre. I thought that it was a great movie. It's a throwback to the old slasher horror movies of the 1980s, except that the movie came out in 2003. I liked the story, and I liked the performances from the actors and actresses. I guess that there is going to be a sequel to Cheerleader Massacre, and I can't wait to see it!
