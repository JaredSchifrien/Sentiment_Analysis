The atmosphere in this movie is so real that it feels as if you were there and could smell it all. Every detail has a meaning. The work on the accents is thoughtful and well done. The music is perfectly chosen for every scene. The light and camera movements actually enhance the story and tell it, too. However, the best of it, is the acting, by the whole cast. DiCaprio, Lewis and Diaz, also tell a story, when they don't speak. I loved the way DiCaprio listens and acts the scene against Lewis, when the latter is wrapped in the american flag. It is the kind of movie that you want to see again and again, to feel it again, and discover new things. It will grow in time, even in the eyes of not a few detractors, because there are many aspects that might escape a first viewing. It's a great film, that reaches your senses, and makes you think. I can't wait for the DVD.
