This was a great movie!It had some parts that were inapropriate for little kids, but it was made so it would go over little kids heads. Soem of the kids still laughed but i don't think they understood, they probably just laughed because everyone else did I am a pree-teen, but I still loved it. It had a surprising ending and was very funny. -AMY
