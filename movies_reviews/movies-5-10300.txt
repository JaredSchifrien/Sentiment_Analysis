Offensive, but hilariously funny comedy. Steve Martin plays a divorced lawyer who's life is pretty dull. His life revolves around his two children, and he gets little free time. That is until Charlene, played by Queen Latifah comes into his life. She wants him to help her call out her true innocence, and find the person who committed the crime for which she is charged for. And with a hilarius supporting cast of Betty White, Jean Smart, and Eugene Levy...you can't get any better.
