As good as it gets is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen!!! I love Greg Kinnear, Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Helen Hunt, so I was extremely disapointed that this lame attempt at comedy with a heart was just so...bad. As good as her acting was in this movie, are we actually to believe that someone like Helen Hunt would fall in love with Jack Nickolson??? Ha! Yeah, right!!!
