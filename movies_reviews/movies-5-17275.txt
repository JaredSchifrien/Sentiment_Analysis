I love this movie. It wasn't an easy film to get into at first, but I was soon hooked and I have loved it ever since. I have tried to show it to other people, and they have ended up falling asleep while I was riveted to my seat watching Peter Lorre in his brilliant performance. This was the film that both made him and broke him as an actor, in that it established him as a great actor but gave him the evil, creepy bad guy character type that he was never able to fully break away from.
