I really enjoyed the first one but as much as I like Austin Powers I hated 2. It was not really very funny with a lot of bathroom humor, more so than the first. One spy spoof was enough Mike look for some thing new. I have not seen 3 yet but it looked about the same stuff re-hashed. Update: I have seen 3 and I was right.
