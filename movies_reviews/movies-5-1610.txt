Terrifying and very deeply disturbing. To make matters worse, I watched this movie when it was first released on video several years ago -- and I was still in my preteens. It terrified me and still gives me chills when I think about it. It is powerful and scary and definitely good for those nights when you want something to watch with your friends. One suggestion, though: Don't rent it for your kid's sleepover. Please, no. They'll never, ever sleep again. . .
