this is one of my favorite Tarintino films of all time. theres never a dull moment as this film rolls on with its amazing ensamble cast and its terrific script. this movie tells the story of a crime, but never shows the crime making it all the more brilliant. the crime is told through a series of flashbacks through all the characters, creating this perfect crime and telling how it went wrong and where everyone ended up, one of the most interesting ways to tell a story i've ever seen.outstanding performances by all the actors in the movie. brilliantly directed, my hats off to you, Quentin.
