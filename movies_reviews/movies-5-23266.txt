The Rosetta Stone of Sci Fi features and TV. Birthplace of Captain Kirk's character, the transporter effect, Robbie the Robot, the quintessential sci fi soundtrack etc etc. Fabulous sets, production design, and effects (Killer pre-CGI but as yet unsurpassed). And a great script, based loosely on Shakespeare's The Tempest. Buy, don't rent. You'll wanta see this one more than once.
