Really good movie. You need to pay attention though, don't leave to go to the bathroom, you might miss something. Makes me want to have some bbq. The relationship between the two women in this film is wonderful. The plot is spellbinding, some little and one big surprise pop up through out the movie. Kathy Bates finding herself as a side story to this only adds to the film. You have to watch it ALL.
