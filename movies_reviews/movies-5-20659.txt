Favorite moments: 1) Danny to Sandy (responding to her what have you been up to inquiry): You know how it is, ROCKIN and ROLLIN and whatnot. 2) the way Marty eyes Vic Fontain at the dance, 3) John Travolta pointing to the sky as he belts out a falsetto those summer NI-I-I-IGHTS atop the school bleachers, 4) Sandy in those crazy tight pants on the Shake Shack. WHAT A MOVIE!!!
