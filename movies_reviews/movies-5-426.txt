After taking my ancient world art class in the spring, watching the movie Gladiator was an exciting experience. I was able to understand the art and culture of the Romans that we had learned about in class on film. The best architectural description they had in the movie was the Roman Ampitheatre. I think they did a really great reconstruction of that.
