Long years ago, Charlton Heston starred in Ben Hur...and in those days the cinematography was surprisingly well done. GLADIATOR came along...and really surprised me. Russel Crowe did a magnificent job in his portrayl of such a brave fighter. He managed to fill his role in this movie with more credibility than one could imagine. Caeser was well done as well, disgusting...heartless...back stabbing and once again...credible. In those times of the world's history....especially Rome's, the producers recreated it all so beautifully and realisitically. An intense, but impressive film.
