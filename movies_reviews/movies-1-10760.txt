Although I've never seen the full movie, and some people will criticize me for making a comment, I've seen the previews and heard about it. Lets think, they are making the devil look like some sexy woman. That is absolutely disgusting. I wouldn't want to watch a movie like that. For a start, the devil is far from attractive. Like charmed, these producers have made the dark side look attractive. You want to know what the real devil is like, well for a start he is the ugliest monster in existance, secondly he hates all of humanity's guts (and that's Biblical fact). He was a murderer and lier from the beginning. Yeah, it may seem cool having this beautiful woman make the devil look beautiful, but if anyone were to really give their soul to the devil for some sensual pleasures, they will pay for it in a big way, for eternity too. It is not worth risking your whole eternity over, just to get a bit of pleasure on this earth. You want to know why the devil tries to tempt people, because he thinks everyone is stupid enough to fall for it. Because in reality, you have two choices. You can keep $1 and pay a trillion dollars (have your earthly pleasures and not be accepted into God's Kingdom), or you can pay $1 now, which will hurt, but get $1 trillion dollars back (give your life over to the Lord Jesus). What one would you choose. Judging by that movie, I know what the devil would want you to choose (keep the dollar, loose the trillion). This is not to push my beliefs or to frighten or offend anyone, these are just my thoughts on this movie. Plus it seems people arn't judging this movie on it's content or it's morality message (which is terrible), they are judging this movie based on lust (because they think the woman was attractive).
