I can't say this loud enough IGNORE THE CRITICS . Just remember most LA and NY critics didn't want to be critics, they wanted to be actors. And their pissed off. Makes sense that they would try to keep the public from seeing an intelligent, creative movie like Pretty Horses . It's a story about honor and truth, love and friendship...Good old american values without all the in your face, you must be stupid, so we will have to spell it out for you kind of violent, grotesque crap that Hollywood puts out everyday. The masses seem to like the crap. If you've seen this movie and you enjoyed yourself, then hooray for you!!!! AND PASS IT ON...IGNORE THE CRITICS!!!
