Really thought provoking film. It's exremely funny, and you can't help but laugh...and then you're forced to stop and think how scary it is that these seemingly ridiculous situations involving nuclear war, could really happen. I don't think our political leaders today have any more sense than the ones in the film. Peter Sellers is brilliant at playing a variety of characters within the film...there is nobody who really equals his versatility in that respect!
