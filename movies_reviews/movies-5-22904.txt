You'd have to be an adult, I think, to truly appreciate this film, but it's a great movie. Man, I miss movies from the 70s to early 80s - the directors really put their asses into them. I'm not a fan of Spielberg's work after this, but Duel , Jaws , and this one - all superb. I love Spielberg's story - it is very well-constructed. I love the wonder the movie incites. I love how Dreyfuss drops his wife (although Garr's a hottie) and hooks up w/ the lady he can better relate to. I really admire the message of leaving the planet, how Dreyfuss is so fearless about it - like his life wasn't so great on Earth in the first place. Now that I'm older, the reunion of the kid and the single mom gets me, as when he's first taken by the visitors and she runs out the house screaming for her son. I love Spielberg's use of color. After this, his sentimentality went into overdrive and he lost me (can't stand ET), but he was still making movies for adults here, and it shows.
