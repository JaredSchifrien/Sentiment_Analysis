School has always tryed to seize the freedom of kids. The great thing about Ferris is that he doesn't care at all what those damn grown ups think. Every oppurtunity not acted upon is an oppurtunity lost forever. So Go ahead. Say whatever it is you feel like saying and do whatever you feel like doing. This is the only life you've got. Go nuts!
