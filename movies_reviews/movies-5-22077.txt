A movie I could watch over and over again. The deep plot underlying it is one to ponder, and its ties to philosophy, theology, and religion is ingenius. There are so many little things to notice that you didn't catch the first time. The special effects are nice, the acting is okay, but what really gets me is that little idea that everything around you is a dream world, and the connections to ancient cultures and theories. Excellent, intelligent film.
