LOVED IT!!! As the final installment in the Matrix trilogy, it was a perfect ending to an awesome story! You definitely get your money's worth when you go to see this flick (which is hard these days with the cost of movies). The final scene is overwhelmingly good and the deep philosophical plot is in full-form. The best trilogy ever made...a real cinematic accomplishment that I'm proud to brag about!
