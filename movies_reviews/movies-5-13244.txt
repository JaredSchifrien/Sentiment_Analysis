Wow. Dustin Hoffman did an excelent job. This is another actor who can be whatever he wants to be. Wasn't it he who dressed up as a woman for one of his movies? That's what I admire most about the guy. He can switch from one character to another so easily. I think this movie really showed his talent to the public. Wonderful, wonderful. P.s.-Edward Norton can do an excelent immitation of Dustin Hoffman in the Rain Man ...
