This was a very well thought out movie, and goes down as one of the best I have ever seen. John Malkovich plays a great role, as well as John Cusak and Camron Diaz. A story about an a puppetier that finds work as a filing person, and discovers a portal into the head of actor John Malkovich. Being someone else is deffintly the theme of this story in more ways than one, and by seeing this great flick, you will understand what I mean. Deffinitly a movie that moves onto my all time top ten list. A must see!
