A disturbing, brilliant and heartbreaking movie. If anyone labels this as just another drug movie, they need to look deeper to see that Requiem shows how someones pursuit of happiness can become an addiction. Ellen Burstyn is someone you would never forget as Sara Goldfarb and in the end, it was painful to see her slowly....rot. This movie must be shown to high schools when there is a lecture on drugs. Unfortunantley, due to some graphic content, that will probably never happen.
