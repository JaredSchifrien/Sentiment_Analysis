An all around great movie. We brought our boys..ages 4 and 5..and everyone enjoyed Shrek. I sit through many childrens' movies for the sake of my kids (although I have dozed off now and again and have found myself bored to tears in others) but this ranks up there with the best. Myers, Murphy and Diaz all do an excellent job, as well as Lithgow. The animation is unbelievable and the story line is moralistic while being entertaining and humorous. My kids and my husband and I were all entertained for the duration of the movie..the stab at many Disney movies was hilarious, there was plenty of adult humor that I hope flew right over my kids' heads. I highly recommend Shrek unless you are overly sensitive and want an ultracensored childrens movie..they do say a** in reference to the donkey..the gingerbread man does say eat me and there are a few references to flatulence..for me and my family, none of this was a problem..but I do know some people who would be horrified..not us, we LOVED Shrek!
