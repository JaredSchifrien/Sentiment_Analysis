I haven't seen it, but I want to. There's just a response I would like to make to ToddsternOhio. Are you sure you are a student of film and cinematography, or are you a narrowminded idiot????? I have never read so much crap that makes me feel angry. Did you know that the human body has male and female hormones, so if there was an imbalance, then that person would either be more feminine or masuline. And there have been many cases of where the person should have been born as the other sex. There are many people in this world who succeed dressing up as the opposite sex and getting away with it. Surely you watch the Jerry Springer Show - you get lots of cases of where a man decides to be a woman and has a boyfriend - and he doesn't know. In Japan, there are men who transform themselves into women who look very realistic. My sister gets mistaken for a young boy. So you were saying.....
