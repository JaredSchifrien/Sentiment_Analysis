It's a highly underrated Star Trek movie! After saving Earth from the alien probe in ST:IV, the Enterprise crew is on vacation on Earth, but soon they will find themselves out to rescue alien ambassadors taken hostage on the planet of Galactic Peace. The humor in this movie is one the driving forces, as well as the interaction between Kirk, Spock and McCoy. The special effects (especially the ones of the Enterprise in spacedock) are excellent. The acting is great and the plot is solid.
