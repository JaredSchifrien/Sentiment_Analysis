I hate to give any horror movie a great rating because I hate them all but in terms of being very good at being scary and at the same time quite interesting as a story and well done I have to give 5 stars to Silence of the Lambs. Very intriguing story, and very scary especially when she is down in the basement of that house and it's pitch black and she's scrambling around trying to get her bearing and he's stalking her slowly with his night vision goggles on. Oh man that could give you a heart attack just thinking about being down there yourself under those conditions.
