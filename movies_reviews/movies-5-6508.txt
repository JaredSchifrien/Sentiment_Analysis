World War I is one of the great under-studied wars of all time, chock full of its own unique, hellish drama. Can be paired with either All Quiet on the Western Front (1930)- the other greatest WWI film drama, or Kubrick's lesser (but still good) other war drama, Full Metal Jacket ('87), set in Vietnam.
