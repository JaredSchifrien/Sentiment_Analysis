This is my all time favorite movie. It is about priorities and what really matters in life. It may seem to start off a little slow, but all of the things at the beginning are leading up to something worthwhile. It is the movie that made James Stewart my favorite actor and Frank Capra my favorite director. It is warm, funny and has a good moral. A true classic and the closest thing to a perfect movie there is.
