a wonderful allegory to the story of Christianity. the parallels were unbelievable. watching Aslon climb the mountain bore a striking resemblace to Jesus in the garden. even if you're not looking for ties to Christianity, it was still a great film that I would recommend to anyone, and the battle scenes were non-gory enough for the whole family.
