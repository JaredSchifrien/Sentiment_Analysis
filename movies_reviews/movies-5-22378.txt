Alien is the best space horror flick ever made. The special effects are exquisite, and eventhough the viewer can predict the deaths of some characters, Ridley Scott is still able to surprise the audience. The performances of Sigourney Weaver and John Hurt are brilliant, and the story has no equal. The tension of the characters is easily conveyed to the audience.
