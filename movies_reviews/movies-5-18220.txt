I don't care how absurd this movie is. Bruce Campbell (Ash) became real popular this one. Those giving this one or two stars are way too serious. Its really amazing that of the 21 ratings, this RainbowStar character is the only person giving this classic a poor rating. Yet she praises that stupid Fright Night movie. Go figure....And she's rating this movie twice which is against RIA policy. The idiot should read the rules.
