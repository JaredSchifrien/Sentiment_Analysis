I remember seeing the adds for this film, and thinking that it looked very good. I was extremely dissapointed and bored out of my gord for about 50 minutes of the movie. Then things changed. You started realizing things about each character in the film. By the end of the movie, I was enthralled. Needless to say, I went to see this movie 8 times at the theater, 6 times more than any other movie I have ever seen at a theater. Bruce Willis is perfect in the role of depressed security guard. Samuel L. Jackson gives a great performance as the mysterious comic collector. And we must give honorable mentions to the kid in the comic place, and to the evil guy in the orange suit at the end. The music is awesome and so is the movie. Definite 5 stars.
