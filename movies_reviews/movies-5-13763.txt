The Green Mile is without a doubt one of the best movies I have ever seen. It was nominated for a few Academy Awards, and I personally think that it deserved Best Picture (don't get me wrong, American Beauty was great, but I think this was better). It's got an impressive cast - Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, James Cromwell, Doug Hutchinson - and the way that Death Row (E Block) is represented is beyond the mortal imagination of most human beings. Both the inmates and the guards are humanized, and it shows the horrors of the electric chair and the many ills of our death penalty system. John Coffey the character is an almost nonfictional representation of anyone who has ever been wronged by the criminal justice system. I applaud the director and actors. Take care, everyone!
