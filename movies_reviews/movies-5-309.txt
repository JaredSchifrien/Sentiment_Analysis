This movie contains all the important elements that make an excellent action movie. While some reviewers are basing their ratings of this movie on historical fact, I am going to stick with the fictional side...as I didn't go see this movie for historical reasons. I went to see it cause I wanted to see some good fighting and some good action. And the movie followed thru all the way. Superb acting all around, and especially so by the great Joaquin Phoenix, a very underrated actor who did an Oscar worthy performance in this movie. Russell Crowe also did a great job as the Gladiator. The bloodbath scenes in this movie made it even better...a must see for hardcore action movie fans. An excellent movie that cannot be missed !
