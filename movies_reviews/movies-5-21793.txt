Don't get me wrong, Chicago was fine. But lets get real Academy, LOTR The Two Towers was the best picture of the year hands down. Now, I'm not one of these fanatics and I actually thought the first one could have been a little shorter, but the 2nd has more action and excitement. It flows better, Gullom-Smiegel is a lot of fun to watch and the whole movie it is a true cinematic masterpiece. I will say that from reading a bit from some of the comments here from people psycho-analyzing the film to the extreme to another person calling it Christian and Harry Potter anti-Christian need to remember ITS JUST A MOVIE, a science fiction movie and not to take it so seriously! Chill out folks. However, LOTR is a fantastic film, no question.
