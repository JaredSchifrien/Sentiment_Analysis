Perhaps I could be called bias for saying I really enjoyed this movie. I take Classical studies at school and find the ancient Greeks and Romans incredible. Although there were considerable exaggerations of the size of some of the buildings and the actual attire worn by the Emperor's sister.....this was a good film and I 'm glad it won an oscar.....Russell Crowe really did an amazing job...I couldn't imagine anyone else playing that role. I agree with Wiggum.....this definately passes the bahtroom test!
