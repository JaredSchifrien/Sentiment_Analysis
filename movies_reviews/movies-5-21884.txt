This is such a great movie, one of the best of all time. Michael J. Fox is great in this movie adding a degree of humor and excitement to this all ready exciting movie. Christopher Lloyd is also hilarious as his zany experiments backfire on him. The story is great, making it one of my favorites of all time.
