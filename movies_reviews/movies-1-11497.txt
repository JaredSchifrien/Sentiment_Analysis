Good lord--why anybody thought this movie was funny was beyond me. The first movie in a long time where I was ready to walk out of the theatre. The jokes were overdone and cloying--most of the time I was embarrased for the actors trying to pull off this flop. An enormous disappointment from Mr. Stiller whose other work I enjoy greatly.
