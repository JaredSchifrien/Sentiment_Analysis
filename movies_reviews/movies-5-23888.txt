Fantastic! I saw this film a long time ago (and now own it) and was taken aback. It seems to me that people seem to miss out on one of the main issues of the film though. Eventually we will be able to genetically engineer our children, but there is one thing you cannot change - what you feel, what you think and what you aspire to do. Ethan's character is an 'invalid', created naturally, meant to be destined to clean up after 'valids'. He believed he could do more - and did. You can take this film as strictly being a scientific viewpoint of the future - but it goes further. Like Alice in the rabbit hole. Watch it again and you'll see what I mean.
