This may be my favorite movie of all time. It's a charming tale of an unhappy princess(Audrey Hepburn, in her first role ever.) who escapes out into BEAUTIFUL Italy. In her traversing about Rome, she meets up with a charming (and so handsome) reporter, played perfectly by Gregory Peck (who, along with Burt Lancaster may be one of the most handsome actors ever). In their time spent together, they begin to fall in love. Amongst all of this, Gregory has to battle his guilt over taking pictures of the princess (who doesn't reveal herself to him..but he finds out and plans to write an article about her escape.) and his growing feelings for her. She goes back to her position eventually, but that doesn't ruin the romance of the film..it just adds a bittersweet element. The scenes with Gregory and Audrey seeing the sights are so enchanting, not to mention hilarious. This amusing, emotional tale is most defiently worth watching.
