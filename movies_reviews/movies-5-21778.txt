Orlando Bloom stole the show and made me jump out of my seat and cheer when he slid down the stairs while firing off arrows at hapless orc and then proceeded to separate some heads from some bodies when he reached the bottom. This film only betters the formula established in the first film. Gollum is a top notch performance. That character made me lauch and tremble and even feel sorry for him. He was brilliant. I hope this trend continues into the third film.
