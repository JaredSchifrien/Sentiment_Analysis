No, I don't believe it. Well, not anymore anyway. This film still terrifies me. The music and the house just send shivers down my spine. I read the novel which was better, but this is something of a classic-as far as haunted house movies go. What do you think. Please e-mail me at turkeystuffing@hotmail.com if you agree or disagree.
