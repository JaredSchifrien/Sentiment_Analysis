The other Mel Brooks classic (along with 'Young Frankenstein') from 1974. In this one, he spoofs the Jimmy Stewart, Marlena Deitrich western classic, "Destry Rides Again" (1939), among others while employing liberal uses of known cliches, situational gags and archetypal characterizations. Co-written by Richard Pryor (among others) and starring Cleavon Little as "Sheriff Bart", Gene Wilder as "The Waco Kid", Madeline Kahn as "Lili Von Shtupp", and Harvey Korman as "Hedy ("That's Hedley!") Lamarr." Comedy hijinks abound as Bart and his pal "The Kid" try to rally the citizens of Rockridge into putting aside their prejudice's in order to save the town from the governor (Played by Brooks) and his hired henchmen (led by veteran Western character actor Slim Pickens as Taggert.) A romp from beginning to end and worthy many repeated viewings. What a year we had at the movies back in 74! My sides are still aching.
