I loved Three Kings! I can't stand how people can come to this site and say differently! I am with every one who liked this movie and as for the other peeps who say otherwise you have got some problems!!Mark Wahlberg was outstanding as Troy Barlow and so was George Clooney, and Ice Cube in their roles! I thought that this movie showed a good perspective on how life was in Iraq. I luved it!!!!!! Great Movie!!!!! Great actors!!!!! Great everything!!!!! I luv u Mark!!!!!That is all I'm goin' ta say!!!!!
