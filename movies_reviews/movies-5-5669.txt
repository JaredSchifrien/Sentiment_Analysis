Gone with the Wind is a classic epic for many reasons. The film is very well thought out, and stayed pretty close to the book ( I read somewhere that if they actually filmed every page of the book the movie would have lasted over 12 hours or so ). The thing that made this movie so delightful and legendary, is the performances made by Gable and Leigh. Though the two despised eachother in real life, there is no evidence of this in the movie. Their onscreen chemistry is wonderful, and the dialouge is classic. When the movie came out, " frankly my dear, I don't give a damn" caused and uproar. The first time "a swear word" was used in a film. Its quite funny now when you think of it, what would be said of our movies today? This movie keeps the viewer interested throughout, and if you can sit through Titanic you can certainly sit through this, 3 and a half hours goes by quickly once you become involved in the story. As any other classical film fan will tell you, movies in the "golden era" of hollywood lasted alot longer then our 1 hr and 20 minute movies we have today, that are more painful to sit through then anything. Gone with the wind is a coming of age story for our main character scarlett, and while she may be annoying at times, in the end, we see a very different woman. Gables charm and wit are another delightful aspect of the film, and De Havilands portrayal of the selfless sister is just amazing. I will be truthful about one of my dislikes in the movie, and that is the character Ashley, there are many reasons for my disliking him, his character isnt appealing in the slightest and can't seem to make up his mind what sister he truly loves. Well to sum up my review, I think this movie is legendary because of its emotional ties to the viewer, it's well acted, thoughtout, and you arent given more then is necessary to truly show what a love story is really all about.
