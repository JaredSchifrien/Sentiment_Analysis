 This film is not only a brilliant horror movie but a movie with a message. Alot of films just go for the cut em up a splash blood on the drapes sort of scare. Carrie however does not. She brings us a lesson. We all can identify with Carrie but we can also identify with those who treat Carrie like crap. We all need to learn to treat everyone with respect no matter how odd they might appear. Not only is it good karma but also that person could trap you inside your senior prom and burn you alive. Carrie does delivere alot of death and mayhem for those whos soul purpose for watching horror is gore and nudity. But for those who care to dig deeper there is much more than meets the eye.
