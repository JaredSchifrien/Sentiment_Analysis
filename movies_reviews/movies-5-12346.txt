Seldom do I get so much pure viewing pleasure from a film in the cinema as I did while watching 'The Curse of the Were-Rabbit'. For those of you unfamiliar with Wallace and Gromit, they are the loveable clay motion creations of Nick Park: Wallace, a slightly gormless, unfailingly polite bachelor inventor, and his long-suffering intellectual canine partner, Gromit. Their relationship is like that of an old married couple, and the adventures in which they get entangled are utterly incongruous with their domestic natures. In this film, they are running a humane pest control service and find themselves dealing with a beast, an enormous mutant were-rabbit, who is endangering the prize vegetables grown by the local villagers to exhibit at the annual fair. The film is unapologetically silly and deviously clever, paying homage to King Kong, Jaws, and a whole rake of early horror flicks, revelling in the hackneyed characters that populate such films - the superstitious village yokels, the semi-crazed preacher, etc. It would have been easy for the filmmaker to drop in these references in a heavy-handed fashion, sticking out as anomalies from the flow of the story, as was the case in places with Shrek, but Park's touch is so deft and natural that they add entertainment value for adults and children alike, albeit for different reasons. There is also a love interest, although, don't expect to have your emotions wrenched. Other than that, I am giving nothing away, as there is a twist in the tale which you may not see coming. Just watch it.
