very, very, rewatchable movie. lost track of how many times i've watched this film. although not my favorite of all time i still like this film alot. the opening of the film was very powerful(especially for military minded type people like myself) in about ten minutes the viewer gets a pretty good idea why the roman empire was the roman empire.(unleash hell luv that line and the straight forward way it was delivered as a matter of fact) the opening was so good that i expected more ,however ,as everyone knows the story arced in a different direction(for the better) but damn what an opening. in my opinion joaquin phoenix nailed the commodus character perfectly and really stole the show preformance wise. r.i.p richard harris. great film.
