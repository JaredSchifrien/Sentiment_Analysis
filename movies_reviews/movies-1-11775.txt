Started well and some very funny parts...by the middle it was getting less of a spoof and more partisan. By the end I thought it had greatly deteriorated. Fans of South Park might like it but it will find limited audiences overseas where they might not get the satire.(obviously) All my American friends I saw it with were rather embarrassed by it.
