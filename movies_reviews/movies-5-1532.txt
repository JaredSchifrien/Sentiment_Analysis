The on-screen chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover made this film as great as it was. Gibson played the tortured detective who you weren't sure or not if he was psychotic. And, Glover played the grizzled veteran detective who was anticipating is retirement right around the corner. The movie had tremendous action and laugh out loud comedy. It also featured a great performance by Gary Busey.
