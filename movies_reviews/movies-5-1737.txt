This movie really is incredible. I've watched it a few times and I'm finally making sense of it. It goes backwards and cuts in and out, keeping the viewer guessing and second-guessing the whole time. Guy Pearce is almost endearing as Leonard, as he struggles to remember his past and make peace with his future. The moments where people take advantage of his disability are heart-breaking. I reviewed this movie for a psychology class once when we were focusing on memory and got my whole class interested in seeing it. This movie is fast-paced and violent, mysterious and intriguing. I definitely recommend it as a conversation-piece, but try to watch it more than once to pick up on the subleties that you might have missed the first time around!
