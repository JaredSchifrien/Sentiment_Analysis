This movie should have been about 30 mins long. How much motorcycle riding does one movie need. The characters don't have any real mission, they just ride. I have never fallen asleep during a movie before, but I was dangerously close watching this one. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, one of the top ten WORST movies I've ever seen. I agree with Flano, the sixties summed up in a movie, it's trash.
