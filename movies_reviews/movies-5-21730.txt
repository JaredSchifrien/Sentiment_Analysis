Supeiorly Awesome!!!!!! I saw it 2 days after it came out, but I do have to agree with the bad ending. Why did they have to show Sam and his dumn,happily lived ever after, thing. I dont know what people are saying about the Shire being attacked by Sarumon. I thought with the death (or collapse) of Sauron,it would have killed all of evil. Anyways It rules!!!!
