Absolutely brilliant from start to finish. Wonderful performances from Wilder, Mostel, and the guy who years later was on the awful Mr. Belvedere show, he played a pretentious gay director. Hilarious lines, and a great and original idea in the first place. One of Mel Brooks' best. For me, the song that the offbeat and wacky, almost forgotten comedian Dick Shawn sings about flowers is priceless. "THE POWER OF A... SWEET FLOWER!"He was great as both a forgetful hippie with a Warholesque Campbell's soup can around his neck, and also playing a jive talking hipster Hitler. Kenneth Mars as the crazed Nazi playwright was awesome too. A true gem.
