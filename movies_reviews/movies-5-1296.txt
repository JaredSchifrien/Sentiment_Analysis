Definitely one of the best movies released in recent years. Brilliantly written and directed by Quentin Tarantino and the entire cast is superb. The movie manages to both funny and shocking in a completely unconventional manner. The soundtrack is great. The first time I saw the film I couldn't quite believe what I was seeing. That's exactly what I loved about it.
