This was so touching that it made me cry. The plot may be fictional but its somehow realtted to our daily experience. It is about how a man improved his inner self ever since he has been stuck on the same day, as he learned from his mistake, he became wiser and not to make it again. As many recurring days went pass by, he became a better man.
