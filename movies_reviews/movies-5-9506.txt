I understand that it is a highly offensive movie, but if you are willing to let yourself go and just laugh at the jokes it turns out to be one of the funniest movies around. If nothing else at least fastforward through everything, but the songs. The music makes the movie worth watching and deserving of at least a four star rating by itself.
