Brilliant Coen Brothers film. proved to me Clooney could act. of course how can you not enjoy a farce based on Homer? anyway the cast was superb featuring a lot of Coen regulars. Stand Outs are Tim Blake Nelson as Delamr(sp) and John Goodman in his small role as Big Dan. as always, a coen quote. Do not seek the treasure. We...thought..you...was..a...toad.
