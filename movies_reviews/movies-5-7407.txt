Unbelievably funny!!!...Deniro can do it all...just his facial expressions alone,cracked me up.His relationship with Jinxie...stabilized Deniro as a true sensitive comedian when called upon. Stiller's need to impress the Parents,still brings a smile to my face..right up there with Ferris,Bill murray,and even John Candy movies...Rent it again!!!
