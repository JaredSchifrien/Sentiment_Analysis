I am sorry but I have to disagree with every single one of these comments. Maybe if the ads for this movie were different the rating would be a 3. Everyone was saying this was the scariest movie since The Excorsist. Yeah, right. This is a zombie movie that was not scary at all. It seemed like every scene was pitch black. Its very difficult to find out what was happening. I love zombie movies, but this one showed how many zombies? 5? The zombies looked like normal people just with a little blood on thier face. The movie starts off horrid; animal rights activists cause the disease to spread. After that its good until the action starts, which is where it gets all dark. Finally, too many questions were unanswered. I hate that. This was a good idea at a modern day Night of the Living Dead, but turns out to be a non-scary, pitch black mess of a movie. Night of the Living Dead lives on!
