I rented this movie last night and watched it with a friend, and we were moved to tears at many points, we felt the pain of the victims, we felt the hatred of their adversaries. I don't understand the raters on here who insist on making this an Oscar or a religious issue. For God's sakes, these were real human beings, regardless of what religious, political, or ethnic background you have. These people suffered and that suffering was portrayed in a fair and painful light. I am not personally Jewish, but nor am I blind to what happened before and during WWII. I cannot believe that some people would twist a beautiful, moving, inspiring film into a political and religious outrage! So Spielberg got an Oscar -- so what? After watching this film, I think he damn well deserved it.
