Although some may be swayed by the sexually brutal and vulgar aspects of the main character and the movie as a whole, Quills is actually a very profound film with an important message (watch the movie to find out what!) This film was shocking, perverse, devilishly funny and revealing; in more ways than one may think. A spine chilling score adds to the suspense, as the film explores the depts of evil. The most appealing character, the Marquis de Sade, superbly portrayed by Geoffrey Rush, is an 18th century author imprisoned in a mental institution for the publication of his blasphemous and erotic novels. His aggressive nature, twisted ideas of sexual pleasure, wicked sarcasm, delightful insanity and yes, even a little bit of tenderness are sure to keep the audience well entertained. Kate Winslet and Joaquin Pheonix (Gladiator) put on excellent performances as well. I found this film to be delightfully refreshing as compared to the main-stream entertainment and I was impressed with its depth and irony. If you didn't like it, you probably need to get past the surface layer of sexual vulgarity. But one thing I can guarantee is that you will not be bored with this movie.
