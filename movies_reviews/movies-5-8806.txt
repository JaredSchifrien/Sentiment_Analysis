This is what a romantic comedy should be. Excellent standout performances by Cher, Nicholas Cage, Vincent Gardenia, and Olympia Dukakis. Cher is a mousy office manager who falls for Nicholas Cage, an embittered baker. Vincent Gardenia has some nice moments as Cher's dad. I don't usually care for romantic comedies, but I highly enjoyed this one, because it had some brains to it.
