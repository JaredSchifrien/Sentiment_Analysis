Directed by Harold Ramis, Caddyshack (1980) is one of those films that should not work, but does primarily because of the on-screen talent. The story is a group of loosely tied subplots involving an upscale, private golf course, namely a caddy from the wrong side of the tracks, Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe), an eccentric, trust fund golf prodigy, Ty Webb (Chevy Chase), the stuffy, egocentric partner in the club, Judge Smails (Ted Knight), obnoxious, nouveau riche Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield), and assistant groundskeeper Carl Spackler (Bill Murray). The humor is often crude, jumbled, and completely non-cerebral as the characters deliver one-liners and situation gags; nevertheless, there is a place for this type of comedy, and it has never been done any better. The bottom line is that Caddyshack is the epitome of a guy film.
