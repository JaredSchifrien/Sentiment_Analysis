Truly innovative for 1984. I am a Freddy freak!I collect all kinds of horro movie stuff and Freddy is my fav. The movie still sends a bit of a scare into me on nights when I am by myself.I recently saw Freddy vs. Jason and loved it! My hubby is a Jason fan and I am hard-core for Freddy. Made things interesting at home!
