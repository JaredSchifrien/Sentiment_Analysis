It might discourage some to describe this extraordinary 2004 PBS documentary as "the real thing" about the events of a decade ago related in 'Hotel Rwanda' in 2004. And yet, there is so much about the filmed testimony that is objective and factual that the narration and the filmed records allow the viewer to acknowlede objectively the responsibilities of the local and foreign parties who, through direct action or inhuman apathy, were involved in the tragedy in one way or another. Remarkably fair in its judgment of the abysmal and abundant human error, this is an unforgettable experience.
