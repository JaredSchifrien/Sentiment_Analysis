Another movie in my top 10. This is by far Drew Barrymore's best movie. She deserved an Oscar for this role. From the beginning of this movie to the end is just wonderful. Even though the movie was made on the storyline of Cinderella, it still had its own feel, and it was great. I would recommend this movie to the whole family !
