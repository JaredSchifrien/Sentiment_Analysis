I loved this movie it had so much tied in one it was a romance, it had drama and a little bit of comedy. I first read the book and I wanted to see the movie because the book was good the two are very different but there are still the major points from the book was in the movie. This movie I thought was good but, it is a real tearjerker. I liked how they showed that you don't have to be pretty or poopular just to have a boyfriend. I thought Mandy Moore did a good job in this movie. I thought it was good that they showed that she was not going to change just because of these snotty people who make fun of the way she acts. I had tears rolling down my face when there was about 30-45 minuets left in the movie. so to bring this to an end the movie is better than you think it would be.
