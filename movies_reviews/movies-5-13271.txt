I don't care what any historian-wannabes say -- this is a fabulous film. It's extremely well-acted (with the exception of Vin Diesel) and the first half hour is so horrifyingly crisp and tumultuous that you actually feel like you're there. For some reason, the saddest part for me was not the dramatic battle sequences, nor the ending in which practically every character is killed. It's the part where the graves are shown in Normandy, perfect crosses stretching as far as the eye can see. They all sacrificed so much, and that was what made me cry.
