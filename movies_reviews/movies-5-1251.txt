Pulp Fiction is one of the most eclectic films ever made. That being said, it's one of the most well-blended films ever. The stories, and certainly odd ones at that, are told to us not in chronoligical order, but mixed together in a way to evoke terrific power and emotion. The dialogue is most definitely the BEST dialogue I've ever heard in a film. Although it employs more explatives than usually heard in movies in 1994, they are used in the right places, adding the right feeling to the lines, unlike most modern films where the words are added to give them movie a R rating. The visiual style is excellent as well. Quite possibly, the best movie of 1994, the best year for movies since 1939.
