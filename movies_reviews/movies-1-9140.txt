This film was a real low point in the movie careers of my favorite group of British nuts. It has the distinction of being the only Monty Python movie I truly did not care for. The classroom sex education demo skit sunk way too low on the common decency scale to even get an embarrassed laugh out of me and I will confess to overlooking and being guiltily amused by some fairly crude things in my time. Should be re-titled The Lack of Meaning of Complete Raunchiness or How to Let Your Lifelong Fans Down well, at least one anyway.
