I have loved this movie since I was a child. The imagination of it was on such a grand scale that it just entranced me. The characters, the effects, the wonderful storyline- all of it were so unique for its time period. Even better is the book by Michael Ende. If you enjoy the film, you're sure to love the longer, in-depth, original book version.
