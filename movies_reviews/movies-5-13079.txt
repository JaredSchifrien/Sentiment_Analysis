Schindler's List is Spielberg's best movie because of how he portrays a flawed character-Oscar Schindler-and his ability to positively affect the world during The Holocaust. Liam Nielson as Schindler is terric in portraying the character who against all odds fulfilled the talmudic dictum given him as a ring after being fashioned from fillings from a concentration camp inmate's fillings:Whoever saves a single life, it is as if he saved an entire world.
