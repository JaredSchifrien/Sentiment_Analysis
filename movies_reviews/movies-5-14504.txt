The only reason people say they don't like this movie is beacuse it's either boring or stupid because he talks to a volleyball. Those people obviously can't sit for a couple of hours and witness an excellent movie. Tom Hanks gives another huge performance. Much of the film contains no dialogue, but still delivers a powerful and memorable experience.
