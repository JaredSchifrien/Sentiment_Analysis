 Madness can be brutal. Especially in the hands of God or Kubrick as most call him. This is his only true horror film. Not in the since of Halloween or Friday the 13th. But as a film dealing with the frailty of the mind and age old precsence of evil.Jack is on scary SOB. I think this a timeless epic horror film. It will be cherished as a classic for years to come. Thank you Kubrick!
