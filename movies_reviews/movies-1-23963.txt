Easily the worst of the ten Trek treks. It looks like it was filmed on someone's ranch in California. Come on, people. Spend a little money. You've got an Oscar-winning actor portraying the villain and a talented crew on board the Enterprise, why waste such a cast on a lame plot about the fountain of youth with sub-par special effects? Horrible.
