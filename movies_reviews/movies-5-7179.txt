A classic. Man, I still remember the first time I saw Christie Brinkly drive up in that Ferrari. This movie has a bunch of hilarious scenes - my favorite being the talk Chevy Chase has with Anthony Michael Hall after he runs the car off the road. What happened to Chevy Chase? This movie, Fletch, his Saturday Night Live days - he did some great stuff. Then it just started getting worse and worse, culminating in that disastrous talk show. If you only know Chevy from his more recent movies, definitely rent Vacation so you can see him in his golden days.
