I could not have had a more different experience with this movie than Shroomwoman. I loved this flick. Seeing the movie billed as a comedy and seeing that Steve Martin was the lead, I was expecting a light, Roxanne-like movie that might be good for a couple of laughs. What I got was the bizarre, dark little movie about a complacent dentist (Martin) who makes a couple of bad decisions, and sees his life spiral out of control. While there are funny scenes, this movie is in NO way a comedy. Think Donnie Darko, not The Jerk. There were some outstanding performances by bit parts - Scott Caan as the villain, Kevin Bacon as the movie star doing research for a murder mystery film, and of course Laura Dern. This is a weird, creepy, dark, bizarre little movie - strongly recommended if you like that kind of thing.
