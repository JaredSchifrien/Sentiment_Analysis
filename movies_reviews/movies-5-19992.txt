Full Moon put out many horror flicks during the 80's and 90's under the guidance of Charles Band, a very talented man. Subspecies was one of the great series of movies produced during his run. The initial film in the series was at times less than stellar, but with one major recast,( Denice Duff stepping into the lead roll of Michelle) the sequals were almost perfect. Radu would have to be one of the all time greatest movie villains.
