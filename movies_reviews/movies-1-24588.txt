Bored me soooooooo much. One of those films that you wind up almost falling asleep on a bunch of times, and it's also one of those ones that, for no good reason, you stupidly feel that you are somehow obligated to watch the whole thing. Then you wind up kicking your own ass for wasting two precious hours on this dreck.
