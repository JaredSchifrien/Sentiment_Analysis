This movie has been greatly overlooked in American Filmography. Jeff Kanew brings together an experienced cast including David Wohl (D.A.R.Y.L. and Brewster's Millions), who plays the upstart and fickle Dean Eulich, and Michelle Meyrink( Nice Girls Don't Explode), who plays Judy, a tawdy and gorgeous accordion playing temptress. It is difficult to forget the writing that clicked thanks to Miguel Tejada-Flores, who also worked on the made for TV film, Heads You Live, Tails Your Dead, and Jeff Buhai, best known for the Whoopee Boys starring Paul Rodriguez. Thanks ROTN!
