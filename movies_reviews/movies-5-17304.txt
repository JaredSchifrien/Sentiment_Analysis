I broke two of my movie rules (no subtitles/no movies about the Holocaust) in order to see Life Is Beautiful, and I'm really glad I did. It's a phenomenal film! The show is about a man who tries to make life bearable for his young son after they've been sent to a concentration camp. Though the show is extremely sad in many ways, it's also incredibly uplifting, heartwarming, and even hilarious at times. The acting is superb across the board, and Roberto Benigni shines in his Oscar-winning performance. If you're avoiding the movie because of subtitles, don't let that keep you from seeing it. I was so drawn in from the very start, I didn't even realize I was reading them. As someone who has tried twice to make it through Schindler's List and failed, I can also guarantee you that the portrayal of the Holocaust is not too graphic. Life Is Beautiful is a movie that you must see!
