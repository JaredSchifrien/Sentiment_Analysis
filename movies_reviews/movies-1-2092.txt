It's no wonder why Sandra Bullock has disappeared from the movie screen a bit. The film that made her a star was the worst of its year. In the movie a bus in manipulated by a terroist, who for some reason finds it necessary to put a bomb on it, so that if it reaches over (or was it over?) 50 mph it will explode. Great, all we need is another cheesy-ass wanna be adventure movie with Keanu Reeves.
