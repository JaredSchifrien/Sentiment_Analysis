A classic shoot-em-up, kill-the-bad-guys movie that should rank up there with Dirty Harry. It ranks #146 out of 250 films of all time on imdb.com -- The comedic one liners are skillfully written into a predominately violent movie. This was also a make-or-break movie for Bruce Willis to see if he could break out of the Moonlighting TV show mold. He did it flawlessly and became an A-list actor.
