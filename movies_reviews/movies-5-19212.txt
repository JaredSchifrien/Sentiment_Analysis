One of the cooolest and dirtiest vampire films ever made! I love this movie for it's originality, brytallity and crudness. This film doesn't care what the hell you think of it. It is here to be here. To give those who love it pleasur and those who hate it emence disaproval. I marvel at the work that had to have gone into makeing a horror movie this inventive and frantic. Written by the master of original brilliant hardcore scripts and Robert Rodriguiz who is a fearless risk taker when it comes to taking on different styles of film bring this edge of your seat horror action extraviganza to life. I love this movie to death and find its unrelenting gore and humor a refreshing change of pace from todays Scream movies and I Know What You Did Last Summers. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Of couse, like most Tarintino stuff, it isn't for everyone.But those of you out there who can keep your minds open and like crazy,psycho,sicko horror films will adore it.
