American Pie is the best comdey in high school this year! A fantastic movie for young adults and teenagers. Although there are some pretty rude bits in the movie, other bits make up for it. Jason Biggs, the main actor in American Pie, is a great actor and he has a great future infront of him. The reason why i give this movie 5 stars is because you can relate to the movie, well,I can see all this happening at my school, but not in 3 weeks!
