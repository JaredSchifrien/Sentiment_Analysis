Unbelievable film (if you can get through the most graphic and violent scenes within the first 20 minutes!) Those beginning scenes are unlike any other I have seen in a movie, however they are necessary to the film..This is an amazing look into the criminal mind. It is hard to explain the severity and honesty that Kubrik conveys in this Classic.
