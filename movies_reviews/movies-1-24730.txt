Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap. Even though this movie was supposedly action-packed, I was completely bored with this one. The characters were absolutely retarded and the directing was infantile. The writer must have forgotten to include a story when writing the script. Argh!!! The only thing that grabbed my attention was Angelina Jolie's boobs bouncing up and down when she moved. Kudos for that Stupid Guy Who Directed Tomb Raider. I wish there was more blood, but noooooo, we have to keep that PG-13 rating, don't we?
