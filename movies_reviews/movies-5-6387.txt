Technically advanced film for its time. Willis O'Brien really conveyed a personality on The Big Ape, much better job than the bogus, sterile special effects of these days. A perverse love story, a tale of sexual frustration, a metaphor for the Black experience in America. Of course, it's dated and creaky, but it's also 70 years old. One of the typically idiotic posters slighted this film because it's in black and white. Well, color processes hadn't been developed for features in 1933, and b/w does have a visual vocabulary, an aesthetic of its own that doesn't necessarily make it inferior to color. Shows you how lacking in imagination most people are these days, spoiled rotten by gimmicks and novelty.
