I'm still kind of digesting this movie, but I loved it. Parts of it were slow, parts of it were contrived, but I found the whole thing together touching and funny and odd. Loved the Bowie soundtrack with the Portuguese accoustic versions, played by a character in the film, just awesome. I don't really know what else to say - just a really creative and cool movie modeled loosely off the old Jacque Cousteau documentaries, with a crazy storyline set against a sailor / explorer starting to get old.
