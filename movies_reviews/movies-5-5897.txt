One of Hitchcock's most studied and talked about films. A fascinating movie that seems to be about ghostly possession, but then turns out to be much, much more. Although Jimmy Stewart is in every scene, this is Hitchcock's film. You can hear his heart beating in every frame. The film seems to be his very personal statement about the nature of reality, the illusions we make for ourselves, and his feelings about women. This is a truly great film that neccesitates multiple viewings.
