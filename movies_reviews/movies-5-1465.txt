Fantastic! An energetic, colourful slice of martial arts mayhem, with a great female lead, wonderful fight scenes and absolutely spot-on music. The music alone is woth seeing this film for. As for the violence, it's a Tarentino movie!! You knew that before you went to see it so why see a Tarentino flick if you morally object to the severing of body parts? It seems slightly masochistic to me to watch a violent film if you're squeamish.
