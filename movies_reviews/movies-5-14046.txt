Excellent film. Sure there are some inaccuracies in it but who cares it's entertainment and excellent entertainment at that. Very engaging, it really draws you in, F. Murray Abraham is absolutely transfixing in this film. He does an incredible job as the aged Saliery. His expressions, mannerisms, and speech is spot on. If you've missed this then you've really missed out.
