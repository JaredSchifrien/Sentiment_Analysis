Complete Bull ****. American flag waving crap makes me puke. This is a story based on the true heroics of a Britsih Naval team, who went in without any protection by the Naval support. Why not tell the TRUE story. Everything is not the USA. The Americans were not even involved when the event took place.Why does every thing out of Hollywood have to polish the American brass. Even movies like the Patriot covered the true story. The character Mel Gibson played was a ruthless slave owner who hunted his slaves for sport. Yet this stuff is gobbled up like its candy. Please get a grip on reality.
