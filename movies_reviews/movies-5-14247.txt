No Oscar marterial, but an intriguing film with a few good lessons to be learned. Russell Crowe's characters' schizophrenia had sort of a double meaning...he saw the world diferently than others did. Sort of like I noticed that everyone seemed to have blue eyes, and everyone else thought I was insane...guess I'm the only one who noticed it. This was probably one of the best movies I've seen all year (up there with Life As A House ) and if the directors don't WAKE UP and start making a couple of REALLY good films, it may end up winning and deserving most of the awards. Overall, a pretty good Ron Howard job with outstanding acting by Russell Crowe Co. Take care, everyone!
