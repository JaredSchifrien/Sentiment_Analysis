Without a doubt one of the greatest children's movies ever made. A very strange,charming and even dark movie. The musical numbers are incredibly catchy and the oompa-loompas are funny as all hell. Gene Wilder and his dry synical sense of humor in the role of Willy Wonka is great and makes the movie. A wonderful fantasy for the entire family. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
