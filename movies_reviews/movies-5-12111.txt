I seen this movie when i was about 12 years old. Funny movie! Even more funnier today since i am older and understand it more. Probably the only movie i like to watch with Howie Mandel or Ted Danson. I was amased how young Dennis Franz looks. People who like the movie Dumb and Dumberer probably would like this movie. Some of the movies that are considered bad are the funniest movies. It is a movie you got to relax and watch.
