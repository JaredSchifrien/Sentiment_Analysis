One of the best coming of age films I've ever seen. I was highly impressed, and this film makes my A list. I was unfortunatly unable to see this film until after it came to cable. However, this film does not require the big screen to come through. The film is beautifully set, and extremely funny. This film is somewhat autobiographical, and the circumstances of the characters as well as their depth allow that to come through. If you enjoy 70's period pieces, or even if you just like a good comedy, I recommend that you see this flick.
