Very heartfelt - a tearjerker too. You really, really feel for Marty and his girl, even when he screws up from being so rusty. It never casts a dim light on women even though it's told from the man's perspective. Well, let me amend that - his mother and aunt are nuts, but other than that, this movie is a great character study that everyone will sympathize with.
