Freakin great film, never got bored during film at all, i only wished for more and more. Halli was excelent with her charactor, all of the charactors had an effect on you, either you liked them or you hated them(Not hating them becuase you think them movie sucked, you hated them beucase you like the evil of that character. Overall this movie needs a second one because I walked out of the theaters cat crazy and ready to to climb on walls.
