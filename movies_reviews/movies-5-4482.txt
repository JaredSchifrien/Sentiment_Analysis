They don't make kids films like they used to. This was a stunning film. Excellent plot where a mere child finds a book entitled The Never Ending Story - You follow the story with him. The key force of destruction in this tale is the Nothing literally non-existence or the lack of imagination. The world in which The Neverending Story takes place, is Fantasia; a conglomerate universe composed of the dreams and hopes of all people. The main protagonist, Atreyu, is the alter ego of the real life boy who is reading the story. Confused? If you haven't seen it then do! The special effects for 1984 are pretty amazing, and the use of puppets makes this experience even more magical. *Update* J-Reilly you sound bitter. Difference of opinion so what, but you really didn't have to quote me on everything and slate it. Surely you are capable of making your own synopsis without jumping all over mine?
