From the first scene you know who is punished for the murder of his wife. The film gets stars for being unconventional. It follows Leonard, a former insurance agent around L.A. He's convinced his wifes murderer is still around and he must find him. The only problem is He can't remember anything so he must tattoo clues on his body and keep very meticulous methods to keep him from forgetting his goal of revenge. The movie works backwards. The movie is like a balled up newspaper; once you peel it open you start to get the whole story. Great performances by Guy Pierce and Carrie-Anne Moss. See this movie twice.
