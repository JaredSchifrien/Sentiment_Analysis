This movie was on TV at the beginning of Feb. 2001, and i was upstairs, and suddenly heard Chim Chimney or what ever they call that song, and I was ready to cry! It was something to hear it again, and being that it was a dismal, rainy day, I was instanly reliving my olden days of that movie, my favorite through much of my childhood, and I was actually crying when I came downstairs and saw it on tv. I was so caught up in my memories and the past that I couldn't believe myself!
