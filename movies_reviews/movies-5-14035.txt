This...is...perfection. An absolutely marvelous period epic, inspirational and essential, brilliant and funny, one of the greatest films of the 80s. It scooped up a gradiose 8 Academy Awards 1984 including Best Picture, which it highly, highly deserves. I bought this movie on VHS because I loved it so much. Wow! I can't recommend it enough. Just two words: See it. Summary: A BRILLIANT AND INSPIRATIONAL PERIOD EPIC.
