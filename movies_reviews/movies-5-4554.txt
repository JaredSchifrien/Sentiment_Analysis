With every new release from Pixar, I have higher expectations. Incredibly (ha ha), they hit the mark every time. Not only did Pixar improve on their human characters (not their strongest in the past), they have more personality and expression than most actors out there. I'm not exaggerating. I was enthralled by every bit of the movie. The chracters were very well-developed and the writing, as usual, was priceless - whether it be through dialogue or simply the situations the characters get themselves into. The story was, again, the best part of the movie but that's what Pixar's all about. That's what I love about that studio. Story first. Eye candy second. And let me just say there is a hell of a lot of eye candy. On top of a great story with more-than-believable characters, the graphics and sound floored me. I caught myself a few times with my mouth gaping open in sheer awe of what I was witnessing. From the explosions, fast camera action, and scenery to the character animation, ocean water and wet hair, you will be amazed. If anyone doesn't see this movie in the theaters, it would be an incredible shame.
