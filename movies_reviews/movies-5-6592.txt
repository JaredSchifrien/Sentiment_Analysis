I am a huge Hitchcock fan myself, and this is my favoite film by him. The script is fantastic, and the acting is flawless. Joseph Cotten was amazing as Uncle Charlie. The way he gradually turns into this sinister character was acting at his finest. For any Hitchcock fan who has not seen this, do yourself a favor and pick it up.
