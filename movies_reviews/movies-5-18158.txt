One of the greatest horror films I have ever seen. It relys solely on what you don't see, which I love, not gore and eye candy. Rosemary's Baby is the story of a young newly wed woman named...YOU GUESSED IT!...Rosemary. Now, she seems to be living the good life with her actor hausband at first, but before long some elderly neighbors start pushing themselves into the married couples lives. But these neighbors and their friends aren't just annoying, they have a deadly secret. One that Rosemary's husband as well as Rosemary are become intricate peices. So is their unborn child! Suspence,suspicion and chills along with beautiful filmmaking, wonderful acting and great story telling holds this very creepy and goosebump inducing movie work so well. I hold this movie up in the stratosphere with the other two greats in the satanic trilogy. The Exorcist,The Omen and...Rosemary's Baby. A ride in pure suspence and horror. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! A Great Film!
