You have to be a woman to get the funny bits, though. And nothing can really beat the book wich a lauhed my head of reading a couple of months ago. Bridget is, in many ways, the only true picture of a woman in out ime. Because all we see are young and skinny models/actresses in Hollywood and they don t tell much about how WE are. But Bridget does. And that s it. I am like Bridget, I want to shag Daniel, but for life I want Mark. We all want respect, and someone who says: I like you just the way you are . Both of them are so cute, but I must say I wouldn t shag Hugh Grant for the world. But I would shag good old Mark Darcy whenever. If he only could ask..... well, this is the end of my rating, hope you like it!
