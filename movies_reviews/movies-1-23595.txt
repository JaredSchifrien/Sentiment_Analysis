A disappointing adaptation of the book although few sci-fi movies do that really well. The most irritating thing was that, while I understand product placement would seem a necessary evil in the modern Hollywood movie, this movie seemed little more than a 90 minute commercial with a poorly interpreted sci-fi story wrapped arond it.
