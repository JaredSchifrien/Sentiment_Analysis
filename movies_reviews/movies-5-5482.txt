Without a doubt, John Steinbeck's 'The Grapes of Wrath' belongs in the national registry of culturally significant motion pictures. This movie, along with the great acting by Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell and John Carradine pulls no punches in showing its audience the deplorable, shattered lives of California-bound Okies during the Great Depression. The tragic quality of the movie is magnified by the individual characters who are engulfed in an ongoing misery. Yet, the movie inspires hope as Darwell's Ma Joad poignantly expresses a positive message at the conclusion. We're the people, Darwell concludes. And they were.
