Wife made me watch it with her. I confess, I liked it. Paltrow did a nice job acting the part of an average IQ person determined to rise from the ranks of her low-class upbringing. I liked her struggle and how she ended up as a pilot. Maybe because I have two daughers and a beautiful wife, I can appreciate a film that encourages women and girls to accomplish, have high standards, and behave ethically. Girls need this kind of role model. Wife says it's a girl power movie. I thought it was great!
