One of the best all time movies ever made. I loved it, aboslutly loved it. I just hoped they went into the lives of these great pilot's a bit more. Such as: By the end of WWII Yeager had shot down a total of 13 enemy aircraft.That in 1954 Yeager retired from testing rocket aircraft and returned to military flying only. There is no mentoin at all about Wally Schirra's six orbits in Oct.62. The most exiting details of Gordo Cooper's flight were left out, how he flew his spacecraft back after 34 hours and a ship that all systems were ethier dead or on there way. Pancho Barnes was indeed a test pilot, in 1929 she was flying expermintal aircraft such as the Lockheed J-5. She also owned and operated her own flying circus.The fire that burnt her club to the ground was considered suspicious because the Air Force wanted that land and threatend to condem her club, acting as her own lawer, she won her case and was awarded $414,000. The scene where Yeager loses control of his NF-104 and bails out happened 5 months after Coopers flight and 15 months after NASA moved to Houston, in the movie is is depicted during and before. All in all still one of the best movies ever.
