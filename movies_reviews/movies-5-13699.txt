One of my favorite movies of all times. I can still remember that almost dizzy/stunned (in a positive way) feeling I felt after going out of the movie theater the first time I saw it. Robin Williams' best role so far and a performance he will hardly ever surpass. Let's not forget that Peter Weir (director) is THE MAN behind this masterpiece. Many young actors went on to become well-known names after this movie. +The ending, which, as someone else has also written, is one of the best in film history (the only one that perhaps surpasses it is in Citizen Kane ).
