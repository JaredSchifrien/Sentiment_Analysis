An excellent example of a perfectly-AWFUL movie. This movie has all of the elements of a movie that cause me to dislike it with a passion. First off, there is no creativity or imagination present--like too much of today's entertainment, it is a pure reality, present day movie with nothing beyond the norm. There are no clear heroes or villains, and everyone has too many flaws to be chosen as the character to support. Angst and anger is omnipresent throughout, as not a single ray of optimism can be found anywhere in this feature. The ending is perfectly dreadful as well, as everyone is either dead or miserable. This is but one of the reasons I very rarely watch R-rated movies, much less enjoy them.
