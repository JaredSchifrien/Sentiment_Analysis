Since Braveheart this the most powerful movie i've seen in a long time. I almost believed that the actors were real people back during the Revolutionary War. They did a fantastic job, esp. Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger. Anyone who i've talked to have said that this movie was fantastic and that they cried. Even though I'm Canadian this movie is imprinted in my mind and I believe it's the closest anyone will come to understanding The Revolutionary war. I definitly believe this to be the best movie of the year.
