I was anxious to see the Virgin Suicides ever since I read the book saw Sofia Coppola's short film Lick the Star . I was not, by any means, disappointed. Since the plot was described many times over in the other reviews, I'll not go over that, just say that this is truly a masterpiece of a movie. James Woods gave the best performance of his career, as did Kathleen Turner and Kristen Dunst. Josh Hardnett also did an amazing job (I think he did just as well in the highly inferior 'O'). The deep sorrow felt by the sisters was so well conveyed, even knowing the ending, I was still left speechless at it's end. I recommend this movie (and the amazing book by Jeffery Eugenides...which is spelled horribly wrong)
