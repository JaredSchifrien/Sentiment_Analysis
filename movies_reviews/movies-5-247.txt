The epic chronicling the life and events of the Scottish legend William Wallace, Braveheart is beautifully contructed. Mel Gibson put on a career performance in this one, both behind and in front of the camera. This movie will make you laugh, cry and cringe in disgust. What else could you ask for? This was the best movie of the 90's.
