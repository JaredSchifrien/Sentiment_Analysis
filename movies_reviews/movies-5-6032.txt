One of the most surreally funny movies ever made. This film was also a well-done jab at extreme right wing hawks and mindless warmongers. As far as I'm concerned the sentiment of the entire movie could not have been summed up better than it was in the scene in which Slim Pickens zealously rides the bomb to his death - Yeeeehawwww! . Considering it was released in 1964, none of us need wonder why it became one of the most popular cult movies of all time.
