Despite other opinions here, I think the movie was great. Haven't read the book yet, but plan to now. Saw it with friends while it was a bit gory, after all it is a Stephen King film, was much better than I expected. Tom Sizemore was the big draw to get me through the doors of the show I was not disappointed.
