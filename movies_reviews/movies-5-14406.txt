This movie is definately in my top 5 greatest movies of all time. The whole cast was brilliant, and the movie was so believable. You laugh, you cry, and you just leave the movie feeling like you saw something worthwhile. I would definately recommend this coming of age movie to everyone. As always, John Hughes scores again ! A wonderful director with so much talent.
