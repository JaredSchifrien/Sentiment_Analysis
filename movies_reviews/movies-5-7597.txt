i think this movie is a little more subtle than other comedies. the comedy comes not from plot, really, but from characterization. Clooney is funny because he's so cocky and 'dapper'. hIS Two partners in crime are really funny, too. So many funny lines, but they're subtle, not shoved in yoour face. some people can watch this movie without seeing anything funny at all, but i laughed from beginning to end. Great characters, great movies, great music, too (and i don't even like country that much). And, despite the yellow-ish nature of the film, it's very beautiful.
