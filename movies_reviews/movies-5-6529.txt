Even allowing for the recent relative neglect of Hitchcock's British films(compared to some of the ever more acclaimed later American masterpieces),i'm still a bit disappointed this doesn't have the higher rating it deserves.Its characteristic Hitchcock theme of the innocent man who finds himself on the run then embroiled with a spy ring is most reminiscent of North by North West,and it's almost as enjoyable- loaded with the maestro's usual cinematic flair,a typically brilliant mix of humour and suspense,and at times surprisingly sexy for the period.Of course Hitch was always fond of a tease.It's my (and many others')personal favourite pre-war British classic.
