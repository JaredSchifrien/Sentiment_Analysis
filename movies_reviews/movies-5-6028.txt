One of the most shocking moments I have ever seen on film is definately the cowboy riding the bomb. That was incredibly powerful, yet also terrifying. Still, I cannot reccomend this film enough. Peter Sellers is ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT AND MARVELOUS in it, as is Sterling Hayden (surprise, surprise, recognise him from The Godfather?), and George C. Scott. Kubrick pulled off ANOTHER masterstroke, the real greatness of his films began with Dr Strangelove, and went on to 2001: A Space Oddysey, A Clockwork Orange, and Full Metal Jacket. This film is hilarious, dark, and even terrifying at times. Peter Sellers, wow, he was absolutely amazing and mesmerizing in his 3 roles, I say: GET THIS OUT. Summary: ONE OF THE FUNNIEST AND GREATEST FILMS EVER MADE.
