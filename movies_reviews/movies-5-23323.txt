The last entry in the Genesis-Spock trilogy -- this movie begins and ends with the conclusion to the events of Treks 2 3. But the main story concerns a cockamamie cetacean probe that disrupts Earth. The core of the movie is a comedic time-travel adventure. Fun all around for Trekkers and non-Trekkers alike. (Oh, and Lister, you might need to change your review ;)P )
