The credit showed early to be given when it is due. Mr. Smith did it again. This movie blew up the charts and rightly so. The presence of one Vivica Fox certainly didn't hurt. But the role of such major proportion being played by an African American was also a big deal by all accounts. This movie certainly gets a two thumbs up.
