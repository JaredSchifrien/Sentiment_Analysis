A nihilistic descent into schizophrenic madness that I can't stop watching. Maybe it's the intricate photographic work, maybe it's Fincher's ear for dialogue, maybe it's the spellbinding performances by Ed Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, Meatloaf, and Brad Pitt, maybe it's all of the aforementioned.....it's an obsessive relationship that I never want to end. From the opening "needle drag" and Dust Brothers intro, you're swept into the dreary dirge of Norton's anticipated existence (recounted through jarring skips and flashbacks), never suspecting the ease with which he ends up dealing with his insomnia-induced repression. Shot through with trenchant humor, jabs at popular culture, and gnarly twists throughout, you'll find yourself enjoying it a little more than you should. A few "squirm and shifts" from time to time (and his name is Robert Paulson), but with a title like "Fight Club", you shouldn't expect shortbread at high tea. Get the disc and see for yourself why this film instills such ardor among its legion of loyal and eager fans.
