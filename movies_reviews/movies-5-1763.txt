Memento is a great movie. the best i have seen this year. This movie is about a man who tries to solve his wife's murder. due to the killing, he has lost his short term memory, so he must write notes on the case. The story is told backwards, so we the viewers feel like we have no shortterm memory. we know what is happening now on the screen, but do not know how he got there. I don't want to give anything away, but guy pierce is great, as is carrie ann moss and joe palmention (?). it is truly an original movie, and i urge people to go and see it.
