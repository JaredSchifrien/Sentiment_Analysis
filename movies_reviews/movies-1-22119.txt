This movie would get five stars from me if it was original but it's just a mishmash of modern sc-fi stories most notibly the works of William Gibson and unpublished novel 'The Morpheus Files: HYPERCITY' that was doing the rounds of US publishing houses in the mid nineties. Now there may be nothing new under the sun but I and many of my friends find it hard to enjoy a film where almost every scene reminds me of a novel or short story that not only did it it first but also much much better.
