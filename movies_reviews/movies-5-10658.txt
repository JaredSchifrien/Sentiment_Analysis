Wow what can I say? What does one base this answer on? Directing Skills, skills of the actors, special effects? Well what I can definately say is that Kevin Smith is pure genius. His characters are well, different. Each character's personality is specially suited for the person playing the roll. Pure genius I tell u. This is definately my favorite movie of all time. Noochie noochies everyone'
