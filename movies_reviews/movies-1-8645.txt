This has got to be one of the stupidest, most unfunny piece or tripe I have ever seen. Grodin and De Niro whould have known better than to make a turkey like this one. When I see it scheduled on TV, I find something else to do, so I won't turn on the tv and accidently see this assinine movie. I absolutly hate it.
