I only mildly enjoyed the book, but had to see the movie because Colin Firth as Mark Darcy alone made me want to laugh (read the book, then the sequel to really understand the brilliant casting!). I loved this movie! I laughed out loud at this movie. Renee Zellweger was wonderful (and I like her better with the extra weight), Colin Firth was perfectly Darcy-ish, and Hugh Grant was such a cad! I totally recommend this movie, especially for fans of A E's Pride Prejudice - there are lots of inside jokes, Colin Firth being the least of them! Keep your eyes peeled for Crispin Bonham-Carter and the name of the publishing house where Bridget works!
