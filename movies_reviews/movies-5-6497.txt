Here Buster Keaton is a civil war confederate train driver,turned down for active service,who has to rescue his girlfriend and train( The General )stolen by dastardly Union spies.When i first saw this classic i enjoyed it but wondered what all the fuss was about.On repeated viewings it's grown immeasurably and i've no hesitation in placing it among the handful of all-time best comedies and silents.Despite its exciting plot,its pleasures are gentle and understated,built gradually without hysterical showmanship.The historical details are authentic.The wondrous comic timing looks effortless,the visual sense is masterly and there's a neat classical symmetry.It may not have you rolling,but it has enormous charm;a lovely,noble,ingenious 80 minutes that makes life feel richer.
