 The father of horror,Halloween,is a mildstone of the horror movie. It managed to balance a creepy atmosphere,character developement,suspence and what would become the greatest mad man to ever grace the screen. This was no easy task especially with the budget granted to the young film makers John Carpenter and Debra Hill. This influenced generations of horror films and copy cats. You cannot deny the goosebump endoesing score also scored by Carpenter. This is an independent horror masterpeice and is in my opinion the Casablanca of the horror movie genre. Anyone at all interested in horror must see this film. Not since the original Psycho had such a brilliantly made horror movie been made. Do not see any of the sequels.
