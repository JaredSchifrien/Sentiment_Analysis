The first time I saw this movie, I thought it sucked. But, Like a fungus, it sorta grows on you. Adam Sandler is not my favorite actor, but in this film, he is just terrific. Kathy Bates, playing MAMA, gives her usual great performance, and is the highlight of the movie. Henry Winkler, fondly remembered as the Fonz, plays a losing football coach whose luck is turned around by Sandlers WATERBOY. The plot is basically predictable, but that is okay with this movie. There should be a sequell.
