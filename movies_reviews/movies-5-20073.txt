 There isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said about this film. I wasn't very scared by it but it did creep me out. It was such a great change to see a movie that didn't follow the same old formula. A movie that didn't have Brandy or Neve in it. Something new that brought about a cultural shock wave. I myself am an actor and found that this film was a great improve exorcise. I really liked and respect this movie.Highly recommend for those into original odd films.
