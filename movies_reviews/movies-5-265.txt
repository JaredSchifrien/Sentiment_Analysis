An amazing film. Braveheart has a little bit of everything - love, vengeance, patriotism, loyalty, betrayal - and it is all carried off beautifully by Mel Gibson in his role as William Wallace, leader of the Scottish resistance against British rule. Unlike many current movies, the violence of Braveheart actually seems to fit the plot. The battle scenes are shockingly realistic, and I found myself believing that the strength, charisma, and intensity of one man could actually turn the tide in battles that were decided by will more than anything else. I can't wait to see this movie again.
