Now this is such an adreline-pumping movie! It has some wonderful action sequences, great fights, and the motorcycle chase scene is incredible! Yes, the dialouge isn't that good, but that's not what this movie is about. Its about the intense energy and excitement, and it really delivers! John WOo did a very great job directing this film! I reccommend that you see it.
