I love the Princess Bride and everything about it. The casting was brilliant and I can't imagine anybody playing the parts better than the original cast. Cary Elwes was great as the somewhat dry, intelligent Wesley/Dread Pirate Roberts. Robin Wright was wonderful as the beautiful if not naive Buttercup and all of the supporting actors were amazing. Wallace Shawn was hilarious as Vizzini and he was so mean you just love to hate him. The on set filming gave the movie a sort of charm that can never be captured in a studio. All in all, great film with something for everyone.
