Great movie. Captured the comic tone while developing the Kent / Lane romance, and it was a nice twist to see Supes go through Hell and back to appreciate his powers and put his dalliance in the proper perspective. A great movie. I wish the Spiderman / Hulk / Batman / XMen directors paid more attention to the first 2 Supes movies - they might've learned something.
