Hilarious film with the two greats Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. Matthau is Oscar the slob while Lemmon is Felix the complete opposite an anal retentive obsessive neat freak. The two are both hysterical, but I find Lemmon to be funnier, especially in a restraunt scene(as Molfan so rightly pointed out) when Felix has to clear his nose so he makes the awful and hilarious noise. It's classic. The movie was a well made comedy that one can watch over and over.
