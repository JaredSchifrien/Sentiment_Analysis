I actually saw them film part of this movie in Boonton, NJ, in 1983. Not that that predisposed me toward liking it; I thought the finished product was a horrible piece of garbage. I'm all for encouraging the making of low-budget movies, especially low-budget horror movies, but there needs to be a requisite amount of talent and imagination involved in the formation of said low-budget movies, or why waste everybody's time? Not even entertaining in a so-bad-it's-good sort of way. If you're a hard-core masochist in search of punishment, go see an Ed Wood movie instead of this tripe...
