Cameron's first masterpiece, proved that he was a likely contender with already-appreciated directors like Spielberg or Scorsese. The man made Arnold the star that he is. And, made several more unforgettable classics along side the superstar. Why-o-why can't Cameron and Arnold get together to do True Lies 2? I know that Terminator 3 can't add up to it's predecessors without these two icons of film. Terminator, the original has impressive effects given it's 6 million dollar budget, and for the times in which it was made. They didn't have THE MATRIX EFFECTS yet (sarcastic). But, you people have to realize Cameron revolutionize effects enough so that they could actually make The Matrix. Action, like most of Cameron movies is relentless and intense... as it should be. Comedy, subtle but all also can be sinister. Romance and nudity, as most of these kind of movies should have (which adds to the story instead of dipletes the integrity). This is the model for every action picture since, that I've seen at least.
