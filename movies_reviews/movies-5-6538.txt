Truly a spectacular film. It has an umatched blend of tragedy and comedy, romance and drama. This film also was one of Chaplain's last attempts to bring the fall of the talkies. Not to mention, this picture which not only stared but was directed by the Little Tramp proved Chaplain can do more than just simple slapstick.
