I loved this movie. The cast of characters is wonderful. It's by far the best film Julia Roberts, Sally Field, Dolly Parton or Darryl Hannah have ever been in-either then or since. I guess it would be considered a chick flick but bring some hankys girls it's a tear jerker. The interaction between the women is fantanstic-each has her own personality, and we see how each one changes and grows, some more than others. Darryl Hannah's character probably the most in my opinion but all the women and Sally Field's husband are marvelous.
