They don't come much better than this.Amazing to think,given the film's now soaring reputation,that Vertigo was generally passed over,and Hitch not even Oscar-nominated,when it was first released.It has so much depth,rewards repeated viewings;is loaded with typically fascinating psycho-sexual insights;beguilingly mysterious and sensuous;gorgeously photographed by Robert Burks;makes brilliant use of the San Francisco locations;Jimmy Stewart unusually ambiguous in surely his finest performance(as the phobic,increasingly obsessive ex-cop);innovative special effects;an audaciously premature revelation;superlative,expressive use of colour.A feast for the mind and senses:an artistic masterpiece and riveting entertainment!
