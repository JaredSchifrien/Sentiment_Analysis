This movie was a classic. It was much better then the first one. When ever I watched that, I used to think, 'I wish I could do all of that, fly, shoot laser beams out of my eyes, had super strength etc.' Plus there was hardly any swearing in it and it was fairly clean, apart from a few violent scenes. Superman's adverseries were amazing, especially that woman. That woman broke that big thug in the pub's arm when he had an arm wrestle with her and when helicopters shot missiles at her and her 2 colleagues, they wern't harmed!
