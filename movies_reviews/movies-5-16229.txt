I must start out by saying that it wasn't what i expected but thoroughly enjoyed the film. The twists and the ending were amazing. The movie was a play on what i think most people don't give to much thought about. It does raise the question, in the mind of the viewer if heoes like that exist. It is an interesting concept backed by great acting and vivid cinematography. I enjoyed this film 100%.
