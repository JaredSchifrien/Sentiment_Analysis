I had very high expectations for this film based on not only the hype, but everyone I knew saying it was this great horror film. To me, that's an insult to the genre. The only thing I give it credit for was it's advertising. It was a low budget film that did very well. It was a suspense film only to the extent that it kept you waiting for the suspense...but it never comes! The acting hurt this movie severely, horror movies just don't work with terrible acting. And as for that plot twist at the end, well, let me just say that for anyone who's seen Silence of the Lambs, I wasn't shocked in the least. Stop reading here if you really want to see this movie without knowing the ending. Let's think about it. What exactly would the purpose be of having a dead guy laying in the middle of the floor throughout the entire movie. Why is he there? There's not point unless...*gasp*...he's not really dead! Tricky tricky. And not that I like excess gore, but to credit yourself as being this terribly twisted movie, a few almost shots of a guy sawing his leg off and the aftermath of that jawbreaker thing that didn't do much...come on. I give this movie a big LAME for being so disappointing.
