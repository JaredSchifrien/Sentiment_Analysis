Would love to see more of these. Hollywood is making more trashy films, and despite the fact they are rated, adults stilllet children tag along. I am tired of Hollywood being the Sodom of Gommorah and Babylon, that is why I don't hardly go to movies anymore. Even my Television is practically turned off now. I do more reading, things that will up lift instead of the SMUT I view.
