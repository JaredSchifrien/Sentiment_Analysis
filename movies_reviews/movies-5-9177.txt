I thought this movie was intelligent, funny, and I highly recommend it. The story was completely original. When I went to the theater to see it, I had no idea what to expect. I didn't even know who John Malkovich was until I saw his face. When I left the theater, I was shocked at what the movie had ended up being about. It was great. It was a bizarre movie, no doubt, but in a thought provoking way. I don't know how anyone can say that there is poor acting. Did you even recognize Cameron Diaz? I think it is great that she took the role even though she wasn't playing a beauty queen. The whole movie blew me away.
