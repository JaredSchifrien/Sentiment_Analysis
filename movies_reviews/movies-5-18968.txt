I'm with Mr. Pink and Thorne. This movie is a great finisher for the trilogy. Ash becomes such a badass in this chapter. Those who find him shallow are dead wrong. He's been through so much, a cabin of evil creatures(twice) losing his hand and his girlfriend! After all that he comes back and kicks major ass to end the series. Great movie. Watch it.
