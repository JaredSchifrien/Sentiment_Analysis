a truly unremarkably film,,,,but remarkable in its ability to trick people. brimming with unrealistic sentimental nonsense designed to tug on your little heart strings. which disguise the long boring plot and horrible acting of kevin costner. second to water world as the worst KC movie. and second only to titanic as the worst academy award movie in history.
