This is one movie that I can watch over and over again and it never gets old. Chevy Chase I think is absolutely hilarious despite people nowadays giving him a hard time. I loved this movie, European Vacation and Christmas Vacation. Vegas Vaction wasn't all that and I think it was mainly because I didn't care for who they picked for their kids. Another great movie if you love Chevy Chase movies is Funny Farm!! I have to say that National Lampoon's Vacation has to be one of the funniest movies from the 80's. CLASSIC!!!
