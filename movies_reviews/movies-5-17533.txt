At last! A teen movie that's not about girls fighting off hormone - driven dumbbells! Jess and her girlfriend were smart; their parents were not lamebrained bigots; the teens and their parents COMPROMISED [instead of Hollywood's parental cave-ins] -- talking about smashing stereotypes! I love culture clash -- Briton versus East Indian; teens versus parents -- especially when it's done right. This was done right.
