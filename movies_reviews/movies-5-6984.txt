This movie is already a classic and for good reason. This is probably Matthew Broderick's 2nd best film, Wargames being his best. The whole movie just made you laugh and feel good. It is rare to see a gem of a movie such as this one nowadays. I own this movie on DVD, and I never tire of it. Charlie Sheen also makes an appearance in this film, and back in those days he was so attractive and actually entertaining......that alone makes the movie worth watching. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
