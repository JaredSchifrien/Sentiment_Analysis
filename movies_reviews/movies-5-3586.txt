I believe this film has got bad ratings due to the fact it is a war picture - hence most people expect action, action, action and CHEAP melodramatic moments i.e. every soldier bites the dust during the course of the film except the main star(hmm Saving Private Ryan). This film is so much more. This is the first film I have seen from Malick and I must say he is an outstanding visionary. It is maginficently shot with its long sweeping shots and panoramic views. Expect a certain stillness and beautiful calmness to the cinematography, which complements the somewhat philosophical nature of the film. Do not expect the fast cutting, speeded camera of the MTV generation. Clearly Malick put his heart and soul into this film (his first for 20 years) to craft a profound, unforgettable and dreamlike piece of poetic art. Those who yearn something a little different, something with a little more intelligence will find that it is a film which resonates a sense of euphoria through the mind and soul.
