HA,HA,HA,Ha!! I didn't even have to see this movie to know it was one of the worst films ever created! Mariah and talent do not bekong in the same sentence unless the word bad is also used. The story is obvious and has been run into the growned over a hundred times. Now it is miss Mariah's turn. Strange how she had a mental breakdown just days before her movie opened. Doesn't seem like an obvious desperate attempt to stur up contoversy and maybe temt some dim witted suckers into seeing a lame and dare i say cliched to the foulist depths of hell peice of poo cinema. If you have half a brain, do not waist your cash. THIS HAS BEEN A MESSAGE FROM THE ANTI - POP STARS TURN ACTOR/ACTRESS COMITEE. I support real actors and actress's in film.
