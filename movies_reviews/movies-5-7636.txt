I loved this movie. It is actually very complex with wonderful allusions to other movies, works of literature, and popular culture such the Wizard of Oz, Moby Dick, and the early recording industry. It has wonderful satire and is loaded with entendre such as John Goodman the Cyclops of both Homer and the KKK! For anyone educated in literature and the history of popular culture this movie is worthy of repeated viewing. For those less literate in these areas, I would suggest they see something else. I asked my son the meaning of this movie, his reply: It's very simple Dad, like the Odyssey, it is a symbolic journey through life with all its fun, adventures, misfortunes, and triumphs!
