Such an excellent movie. I believe I saw it the summer I turned 13 in the theater and I love it as much now. Ferris was the guy everyone wanted to be around and everyone wanted to be like. His blissful day of playing hooky with his best friend and girlfriend was and is everyone's dream day, no matter what your age. Bueller..Bueller..Bueller..
