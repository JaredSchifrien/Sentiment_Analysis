I absolutely loved this movie and have seen it 3 times now because I want my friends to see it too and have watched it with them. It is not only very very funny, but also very intelligent, with astute observations about our culture and references to literature and classic film (e.g. Wizard of Oz). Basically a road movie set in the depression-era South. The performances by the three leads are outstanding. I have never been a fan of George Clooney before, but I thought he did a hell of a good job in a smart and comic role as the know-it-all, scheming leader of the trio of escaped cons. Kudos also to Tim Blake Nelson as the sweet but dumb (as a bag of hammers) con, and John Turturro as the gangly, angry con of the trio. The music is also wonderful, though I am a fan of bluegrass anyway. But it's not surprising to see this kind of music hit a popular chord - it's sweet, unslick, unaffected and touches our history. The Coen brothers have done it again, but done it again in a different way... again.
