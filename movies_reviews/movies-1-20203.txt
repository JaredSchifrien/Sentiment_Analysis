I hate to keep using sucks to describe movies, but as long as they keep churning out this crap I'll use the term. I can't believe Angel lowered himself to star in this hopeless garbage. Did they really think that guys would watch this just because they threw Denise Richards in, along with a bevvy of other good-looking girls? Tell me that we're not that shallow.
