I loved the first movie, but this movie . . . oh, man, they could have done so much with this, but it seems they chose not to! In the first movie, they handled the CG and special effects beautifully, but in this one, it seemed they slacked off quite a bit (not that I can do better, but that Scorpion at the end was mind-numbingly HORRIBLE!). And the zepplin . . . oh, that was a bad idea. And, since sais originate from the 1600's in Okinawa as a farming tool, it's kind of hard to accept that ancient Egypt possessed these things as weapons back then! Doing the face-in-the-sand thing in the first movie was kinda cool. Doing the face-in-the-water thing in this one was repetative. And, for the Rock fans--he's only in it for all of maybe two minutes, one of which is spent in a horrible CG replication of him. You'd be better off seeing Scorpion King if you want to see him. Altogether, if you want to watch it, by all means do so . . . just know that you've been warned!
