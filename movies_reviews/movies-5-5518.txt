I knew the novel before I saw the movie, so when I saw Norman Bates I was a little fearful that I wouldn't be able to accept him as a psychotic. The book described as being plump and red-faced, but Mr. Perkins did a great job of being charming but quirky. The musical score is great and this is absolutely one of Hitchcock's best.
