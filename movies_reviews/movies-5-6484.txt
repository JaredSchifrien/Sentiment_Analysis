Spectacular, Marvolous, Perfect. Pretty high praise for a movie. But all these are totally deserving in one of the greatest if not THE greatest classic mystery movie of all time. Humphrey Bogart is superb in his role as the wise-cracking chick magnet Philip Marlowe, and Lauren Bacall ( who is never dissapointing and is the only female alive who can make smoking look good ) is magnificent as the sexy, deep voiced love interest. It has comedy, action, and taught suspense. Definitely a must see for any fans of movies.
