This has got to be the ABSOLUTE WORST movie I have EVER seen!!!! I could not believe the producers would put out something this awful. There was none of that humor that makes the Garfield comic strips so funny. No kicking the crap out of Odie, no humorous jokes about Jon, no nothing. This movie lacked substance, it really did. I would rather have lost the $8.50 I spent on the ticket on the streets somewhere rather than sit for an hour and half forced to watch this mess because I don't like to waste money. I hated this film!!! The least they could have done was make Odie animated as well then maybe they could have done some of funny things they're known for doing to each other. But, you could tell that this sh*t was low-budget. The acting was terrible, the set was terrible, the cast was terrible, the plot ridiculous (Odie gets kidnapped by a TV show host because he can dance and the guy wants him for a co-host and Garfield sets out to rescue him). At the end Jon ends up with Liz the vet. Now that would never happen in the actual comic strip. STUPID!!! I am really ranting here but I am actually a big fan of the comic strip, I own several books full of them, I've bought posters, the works so I feel I can really be a critic here. This movie did not represent what Garfield is really about at all. It was pathetic. The End.
