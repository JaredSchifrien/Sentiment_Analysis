I am not even a Star Wars fan and I absolutely love this movie. I don't understand why people dislike this movie for the simple fact that it has a lot of special effects. I think it enchanced the movie and made things look more realistic myself. And the original Star Wars films probably would have had more computer-generized special effects back then if they had the technology to do so. I have to admit, the acting's not that great...especially with the little boy who plays Anakin. But that by no means prevented me from enjoying the movie...I don't go to see movies to judge people on their acting skills. The only big distraction was Jar Jar Binks...he was just plain annoying. To see the movie in theaters was breath-taking. During the pod racing scenes I got goosebumps...the rumble and roar in the theaters was incredible. People can bad-mouth this movie as long as they want, but they can't deny that the lightsaber battle at the end is one of the coolest scenes they have ever saw in a movie. And the music...oh man, the music is stunning. I had to buy the soundtrack to the movie right after I saw it. John Williams is an excellent composer. His use of chorus in this film really enchanced it. The chorus always signaled hidden danger, and triggered a sense of badness lurking about. One thing I like about this movie is that anyone can sit down and actually enjoy this. I know a lot of people can't sit down in front of The Empire Strikes Back and actually get into the movie...a lot of people who really aren't into sci-fi stuff get bored with it quickly. I have never seen a Star Wars film before I saw this, and I really liked it. My mom even enjoyed watching the movie. It doesn't have all that high-tech lingo that they use in the other Star Wars movies...that gets annoying after a while, especially if you have no idea what they are talking about. Anyways, a great movie, one of my favorites and I can't wait for the next one! Peace out :)
