If nobody knew anything about movies and entertainment and all of a sudden Hollywood came out with the 9, 10, 11 thousand movies that have ever been made all at once, and I could see a preview of what all the movies were about, with every movie hitting the big screen at this very time with ticket prices at $50 or higher, Terminator 2 is the very first movie I'd go and see, because it would have the most stimulating appeal upon the way I think of entertainment. Dramatized action scenes, sheer adrenaline and sustained momentum all throughout the movie. A sci-fi storyline in a real world setting. Brilliantly pieced together. A genuine masterpiece. To say it's not my favorite movie would be like saying the sun's surface is kind of warm.
