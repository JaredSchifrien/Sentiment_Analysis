I really enjoyed this film - I even saw it twice at the cinema. Yes, you could regard it as lame and just the same as the other two - but I found it hilarious. Michael Caine was fantastic and I liked the scenes where Austin Powers and Doctor Evil were at school with Basil. People relax! Its just a silly movie for people to have a giggle.
