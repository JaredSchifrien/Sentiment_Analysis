This was a demented and twisted movie done right. From the first second of this film I was completely into it. It grabs your attention and holds it the whole way through. Even though the plot is totally unrealistic, it is the possibility that makes you wonder what goes on in our subconscious. The unconscious is a mystery to all of us and this film is one interpertation of what might be lying underneath. This movie is one the most creative movies I have seen in years. It was beautifully done, with scenes that have all the elements come together. The colors, the music, and the acting were great. The cinemotography, along with the photography were exceptional. This movie was scary but in a weird way. As I already stated, the acting was great, but the movie was so visually stimulating that had there not been dialogue, you would still have been able to understand it. After I left the movie, I don't think I spoke the whole ride home. It was almost too much to digest. I have had weird dreams for the past two nights. I highly recommend this movie as long as you have the stomach for pyschotic thrillers.
