I bought this movie on DVD without watching it on my brother's suggestion. He talked so much about this movie being one of his favourites, so I thought it was going to be great. The first time I watched it, I was dissapointed with the entire movie, except for the ending of course. Then, I watched it for a second time, and everything came together. With the knowledge I had of the ending, it made the rest of the movie so much better. Now, it is one of my favourites. I say I have watched the movie over 20 times, no joke.
