What a masterpiece. First, there is a tremendous cast...Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall. Each of the actors puts in a performance of a lifetime. Second, the storyline is so compelling and well written. Right in front of your eyes, Michael Corleone changes from the innocent, young soldier into the head of the family. Third, the movie made the Mafia a part of popular culture and paved the way for future movies and tv shows in the genre. If you haven't seen this movie, you are only hurting yourself. It is wonderful.
