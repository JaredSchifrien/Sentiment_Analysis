If you thought this movie was pointless and crude, then you should withhold judging it untill you see the other 4 movies in the View Askew universe. CLERKS was the first, and introduced us to Jay and Silent Bob. There was also Chasing Amy and Mallrats. The fourthfilm, perhaps the crudest and rudest of all, DOGMA. And bringing the series to its conclusion, Jay and Silent Bob. ALl five are great, and as the series goes on, the courser and funnier the movies get. If you watch it expecting to see a great film, then you will be dissappointed. You go into a movie like this expecting crude humor, and silly stuff, then you've hit the motherload with this one. I really enjoyed it.
