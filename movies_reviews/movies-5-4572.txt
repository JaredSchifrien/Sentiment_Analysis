Babe had a little too much tongue in cheek humor and realism for me to see it as a simply a children s film. Not that children might not want to watch the biggest part of it. However, the first portion is as upsetting as a similar scene in Disney s Dumbo that, having seen first as a child, has stuck with me my entire life. I m also not sure that this and another aspect of the film the way the pigs were kept - would be very entertaining for younger or more sensitive kids to see. It was actually pretty hard for me to watch as an adult. (A good thing about it would be its ability to bring about awareness of these conditions and hopefully change). Beyond that, the movie is fun and has a lot of humor the kids will probably not totally understand. They should enjoy the lively imaginative characters though and Babe s quest to realize his dreams. Also, the Border collies are beyond adorable as is Babe himself. My favorite part of the film is when Babe lifts up his little snout and sings to his heart s content (La, la, la!) sweetly hilarious. Well, I guess that will do for now.
