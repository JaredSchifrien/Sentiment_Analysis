Classic SF from director Robert Wise. Released the same year as The Thing (just as its re-make was released in the same year as ET), this was pretty much the first movie to speculate that they might not be evil BEMs (BugEyedMonsters) after all. Has an advanced and mature message, for Cold War audiences, but still relevant today. Has one of the classic SF robots. Klaatu Barada Nikto
