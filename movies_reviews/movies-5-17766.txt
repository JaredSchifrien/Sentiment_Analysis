 Halloween represents the beginning of an era where a great story can be told for a minimum budget. I have no doubt -- this movie would never have been such a success without the signature soundtrack. Like Psycho , this movie demonstrates the synergy between sight and sound. (Mute your TV and watch the end of Psycho or Halloween. It is totally different.)
