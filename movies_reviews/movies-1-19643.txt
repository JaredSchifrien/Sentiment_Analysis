One of the greatest waists of talent, money and time ever made. A huge smack to the face of any contemporary horror fan and any fan of old Hammer films, for this has to be the most god awful remake ever made next to the remake of Night of the Living Dead. You would be better off Watching Bring it on or an equally horrid film like Pearl Harbor. House On Haunted Hill 1999 is pure sh*t. Stay away at all costs.
