Outstanding performances from Crowe and Phoenix(who should have won best supporting actor) assist this already wonderful story and magnificiantly filmed masterpiece. A good old fashioned tale of justice being served, with a twist of course. If you somehow have managed to not see this movie, I strongly suggest that following this obvious repeated smacks to the forehead you deserve, you should purchase this movie.
