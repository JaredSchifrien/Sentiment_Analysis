Closer is so honest that you might find yourself cringing. This is the kind of honesty that is absolutely necessary for a movie dealing with sex, love and betrayal. Without it, these themes will not connect to the viewer and will settle into fantasy. If you like to stay up late reading romance novels don't go see this movie.
