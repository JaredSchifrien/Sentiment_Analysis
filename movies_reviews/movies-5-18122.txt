Absolute classic. It used to come on late at night on a Fri or Sat night when I was a kid in Chicago. Used to scare the bejeezus out of me. It's not the effects, acting, technicalities, etc that get you - it's how it all works. The camera angles, the pacing, the prevalent darkness, the sense that something horrible has happened, due to the documentary style (like a nuclear apocalypse has occurred), the realistic TV newscast, the interplay of the characters, and the fact that this is the 1st zombie movie and Romero's first (amazing) - plus the racial overtones and that heart-breaking ending - and then that scary music at the end - fantastic! But you'd have to see it at an impressionable age.
