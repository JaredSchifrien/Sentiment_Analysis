I made a huge ,istake and saw the remake first. I thought that it was so terrible that I didn't even want to see this one, but when I did watch it, I was surprised at how superior it is. It is very creepy and scary, without all of the blood-splatter of recent horror films. This is probably the 3rd scarriest movie I've ever seen.
