With jokes flying a mile a minute, Airplane is an absolutely hilarious movie. The ridiculous, often bizarre humor can catch you off-guard, which makes the movie even funnier. I start laughing just thinking about Barbara Billingsley (June Cleaver) talking jive or the woman who wonders why her husband is having a second cup of coffee, which he never does at home (a spoof on an old commercial). Because this movie is jam-packed with clever word play, I recommend seeing it several times in order to absorb everything.
