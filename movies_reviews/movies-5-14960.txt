What a great movie!!! I give it 5 stars without a doubt. If I could, I even wanna give more than 5 stars. I love the movie itself, actors (chemistry between veteran Mel Gibson and new-comer Heath Ledger's are sooooo good), soundtrack! I've seen the movie three times and I can't wait till it comes on vhs or dvd.
