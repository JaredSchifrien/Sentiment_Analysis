This is the original disaster movie. My favorite scene was when Stella Stevens fell into the fire, I'm sorry but she nagged her poor husband, Ernest Borgnine, to death and took Gene Hackmans side on everything, Seriously though, the best scene in the movie was Shelley Winters Death swim. The movie makes you wonder if you would have the guts to make that swim. I still wonder.
