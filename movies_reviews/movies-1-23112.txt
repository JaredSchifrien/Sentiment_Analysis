With Star Wars, George Lucas turned the film industry on its head. With Phantom Menace, George Lucas joined the rest of the film industry in its superficial marketing-fest. Phantom Menace does not have the uncorrupted feel of (the original 1977 version of) Star Wars. Episode I takes itself far too seriously. It has no wit, no great chemistry between the stars, and hardly any character development. The actors do very little to create sympathy. All that and barely enough plot to fill a midichlorian's left nostril. But what about all the great inside jokes? I hear you whine. What about them? If I want a bunch of gratuitous inside jokes, I'll watch the latest Disney movie.
