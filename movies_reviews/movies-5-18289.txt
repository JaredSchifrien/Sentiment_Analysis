The first Nightmare will always be the best. The story behind the story (told later in New Nightmare) holds true to this day. If you don't keep the monster alive by telling and retelling his story, true monsters will be found among us. This is something believed by many. I can personally say that Freddy scared the bejesus out of me the first time I saw it. Now, it's more like comedy to me, but the original had some serious horror to it. Freddy's one liners became a joke after this movie, but truly, I hid my eyes alot during this first one and not just because I was only 16 years old at the time.
