 Hoosiers is a terrific basketball movie. Gene Hackman stars as a new high school coach with a mysterious past, and his approach to coaching raises the eyebrows of his players and the townspeople alike. Hackman's character forges ahead, and eventually takes his team to the Indiana state finals. The build-up to the finals was very effective, and I found myself totally involved in the outcome. After living in a small town in Indiana for two years, I can attest to the fact that people really are that obsessed with basketball! If you're looking for an absorbing, feel-good movie, try renting Hoosiers. You won't be disappointed.
