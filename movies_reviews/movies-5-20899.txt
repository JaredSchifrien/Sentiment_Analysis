They should really let Baz Luhrmann make more movies, he never just shows up and lets the film roll. Every time out, he opens all the windows and fills the movie theatre with fresh air. Maybe not everything works every time, but you never walk away thinking "Oh, I've seen seen that movie before". Movies need more wild, wreckless, imaginative movies like this one.
