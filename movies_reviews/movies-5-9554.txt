One of the best movies of recent years. It's not a laugh-out-loud comedy like many on this list, but its hilarious in parts and engaging throughout. A real life look at real guys. In some ways, Swingers is like a male version of Fried Green Tomatos or one of those other quintessential chick movies. After all, this is all about how four 20-something guys cope with a friend that's lovesick and depressed. While I know some female viewers get turned off by little flashes of misogyny, the more important message of the movie is about the quirks of male friendship, and how friends rally to help each other in non-obvious ways.
