If you want a horror movie more concerned with a story than blood and guts, then Identity is definitely worth your while. Finally there's a scary movie out there without some superhuman madman going on a murderous rampage. Great performances from an ensemble cast carry this movie from beginning to end and through a few plot twists that you won't see coming. An overall entertaining movie that will leave a lasting impression!!!
