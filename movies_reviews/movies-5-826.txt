 Alot of respect for this film. Not the best ever but definetly well written acted and directed. I am so glad this movie came out. We needed a horror film that prooves it does not require gore,teenagers,nudity or an R rating for a great movie. What I believe to be the greatest shocking ending of all is the fact that the man responsible for this pumped out the slowest blah movie of the year, Unbreakable. Now that is a truly unpredictable ending.
