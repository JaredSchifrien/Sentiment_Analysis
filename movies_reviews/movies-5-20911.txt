I have found that this is one of those movies that people either love or hate. Luckily for me I absolutely love it. There is so much ot discover in this movie. It is both heartbreaking and touching with its storyline, breathtaking with its aesthetic beauty and the music is just wonderful. Ewan and Nicole deserved Oscars. I urge everyone to open their minds and give this creative masterpiece a try.
