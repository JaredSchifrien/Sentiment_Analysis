Just as good as the origional, only better because there was much more comedy mixed with the drama and action in this film, probably with some help from Joe Pesci. This is one of the few sequels that has surpassed its origional. I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. The writers did a great job of integrating the drama (Riggs's new relationship) with the comedy (The bomb on the toilet). I thought that Riggs's frequent referral to the German criminal as Adolf was hilarious. I liked the line towards the end where the crooked diplomat is standing above the action and says Diplomatic Immunity , and Glover shoots him and responds, It's just been revoked . Better than the origional and truly worth watching.
