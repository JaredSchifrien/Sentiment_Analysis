The top grossing film of 1984, Ghostbusters (directed by Ivan Reitman) was a nice mix of child and adult comedy. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson are paranormal investigators (or ghostbusters) in New York City. The quartet capture ghouls, ghosts and other goblins in portable containers and keep them permanently secured at the office which is held down by their secretary (Annie Potts) until an unbeliever shuts off the power releasing the carnage back on the city. All this is just a prelude to the big showdown with Gozer the demon who has taken over a building and two of its tenants, Murray's love interest played by Sigourney Weaver and the resident pathetic CPA (Rick Moranis). What makes this film work is the chemistry between Murray, Aykroyd and Ramis as they counter balance each other's personalities. Moranis was perfectly cast as well. Moreover, the comedy still holds up today as do the special effects. My only complaint is that the addition of Ernie Hudson felt forced as if the producers decided halfway through the movie to add an African-American actor. The bottom line is that Ghostbusters remains a funny film even after almost 20 years.
