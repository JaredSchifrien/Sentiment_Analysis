This movie was excellent. U realize that some people who have commented on it think otherwise, however it is due in part because they have no clear understanding of what a borderline really is. Who cares if Wyonna Ryder was in the movie, the fact that someone played the role of Susanna Kaysen..was all that mattered...and that she was evaluated and treated... Susanna was one of the lucky ones... she could be helped and she could go on to live a normal healthy life until some of the others,,,,We must never critized that which we do not understand... Mental Illness happens everyday... and we do not have the right to make light of it.. instead we should perhaps take a closer look and try to understand the plight of those trapped inside themselves...
