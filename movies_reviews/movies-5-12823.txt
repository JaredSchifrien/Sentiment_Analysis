One of the best documentaries I have seen.Robert Crumb was the king of underground cartoons of the 60s-70s and later-his art was seen not only in papers and publications,and featured in his own comic books,but also made it on to album covers.His twisted humor went right to the core of social satire.In this movie you meet him,his brother and mother and several celebrities he dealt with.It is both sad and funny.After the movie was made his brother (who was also a talented artist)committed suicide.
