WHAT??? Psycho is a masterpiece! Psycho is probably the best movie of all time and destiny23 calls it dull!!! To everyone who did not say Psycho was a great film, I have a defense. Anubis, you say this film is really great and then give it a 4, which = good! Anyway, u say that its really great considering how old it is. What movies do u watch??? It came out in 1960! Have u never seen Ben-Hur, Rebel without a Cause, 12 Angry Men, anything by Chaplin, most any Hitchock or Wilder??? As to Callmetootie, the first half is very suspenseful and brilliantly done. The fact that the shower scene was done 50 minutes into the movie is amazing - the director killed off the main character in the middle of the film - that is shocking if u dont know if its coming and very daring since it was never done before. Read some analysies about the movie and study it and u will like it more, u seem literary, the movie reeks with symbollism and foreshadowings, it's a dark dark comedy, and recurring images. domilyn, add a star. for me. i dont find init's joke funny, i would if it were for any other movie but dont bring down psycho's rating!!! revote! And baci, add a star.
