As with most Reese Witherspoon flicks, the key word is cute. This movie was a pleasant surprise. The actors were all talented that charmed you. The typical, sweet story of country girl goes to the big city, lost love and having to choose between the two worlds. Predictable but the joy of it is that you want it to happen predictably...with the happy ending.
