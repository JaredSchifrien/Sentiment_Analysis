I just saw Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within last night, and was very impressed. The graphics were enough to put me in complete awe, and the story isn't bad either. My only complaint is that the story doesn't really relate to the Final Fantasy video game series very much. There are some other nit-picky details as a Final Fantasy nut, but the movie as a whole was excellent, and much better than a lot of other movies out there today. Plus the new CGI animation is revolutionary. Much better than any other computer animated movie in existance. Hooray for Square for starting a wonderful new trend.
