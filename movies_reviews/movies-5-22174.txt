This is far and away the best movie I have ever seen. It skillfully weaves multiple plot lines and genres into a seamlessly original, inventive story. Laden with unprecedented and special effects, it is pure visual candy. The villains are intimidating, the heros believable and inspiring. I cannot recommend this film enough!
