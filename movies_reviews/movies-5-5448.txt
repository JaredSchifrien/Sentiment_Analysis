Cary Grant clambering over Mount Rushmore! This is one of the great Hitchcock presentations. Watch for the little kid covering his ears at the shooting scene in the restaurant at Mount Rushmore. The scene had gone through sevaral takes and the little kid knew when the gunfire was to start. I wonder why the lemmings don't try to re-make this masterpiece?
