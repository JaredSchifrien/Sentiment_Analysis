If you're looking for a scary movie, stay away from this one. I had saw one critic rate it as The scariest movie I've seen in years , which is why I went and seen it over a couple of others I had in mind. However instead of getting scares from the movie, I got disappointment. Unless of course, your opinion of scary is movies like Scream.
