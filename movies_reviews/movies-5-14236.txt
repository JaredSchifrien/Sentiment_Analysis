A very well done movie.This is based on the life of mathematician John Nash. Russell Crowe did a wonderful job portraying John Nash and his battle with schizophrenia. I really felt for John and the demons that he delt with his mental illness. I felt this movie showed a real brutal honesty about how hard it must be to deal with schizophrenia.Ron Howard won a much deserved oscar for his directing. I would recommend this movie. It is a bit too long though.
