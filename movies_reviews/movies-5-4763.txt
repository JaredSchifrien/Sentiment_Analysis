This was the best movie I've seen in a long time. Should definitely be a classic. My 5 yr. old didn't move through the entire movie. He was completely enthralled. Everyone should see this one. The animation is out of this world! Saw Incredibles & Shark Tale. This one blew them out of the water! It's a must see!
