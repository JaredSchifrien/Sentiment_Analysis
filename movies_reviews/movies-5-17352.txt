Powerful, dark, intense, and richly metaphoric; it is still one of my favorite films of all time, but I have to be in the mood. Not suited for the typical American taste, since it requires attention, thought, patience, and a bit of education. It doesn't hurt to know a bit about European history and to have read Kierkegaard, either.
