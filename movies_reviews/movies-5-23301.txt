it's an even numbered trek movie, so it must be good. that's out of the way. the borg are an excellent, frightening villain, though the borg queen might have been more impressive. first contact with the vulcans on earth was a top ten trek moment. zephrom cochran sure looks different than he did in the original series, but who's paying attention. you have got to admit that the moments where picard gets accused of having an ahab thing for the borg, and when he calls worf a coward were exceptionally cool and well scripted. same as when worf responds by telling him if you were any other man i would kill you where you stand , and the eventual apology in which picard tells worf he's the bravest man he's ever known. data also makes good. the battle for the deflector dish was extremely interesting: i love how worf uses a borg's arm to seal a leak in his space suit. great effects, too.
