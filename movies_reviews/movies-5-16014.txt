What an incredibly beautiful movie! I was in love with this movie from the moment I saw the trailer and only fell deeper in love once I saw it. I wish I was seeing it again right now. :) Parts of this movie seem more like a dream than a movie, a really really interesting and inspiring dream. The symbolism in this movie is at once beautiful and debateable. Although all the characters in this film are interesting, certainly the two most engaging are the leads ...Largeman(Braff) and Sam(Portman) with the most alluring being Portman's character Sam. What a sweet, fun, and all around awesome character this was ... one of my fav movie characters ever! Portman's talent certainly had a lot to do with the believability of this role. She might be becoming quite the little scene stealer after all! Zach Braff was good in his role too but it's hard to shine too much when your character is only just now coming out of a drug induced state of numbness ... makes the acting, well, kinda numb! :) In that case, he played his part well. But regardless of Portman stealing the scenes she was in with him, he should be proud, really really proud. Because even when I was mesmerized by the charcter of Sam and Portman's portrayal of her, I still found myself pondering the amazing talent of Zach Braff who wrote, directed, and starred in this film! How awesome is that?! And what a beautiful movie he made! I can't wait to see what he does next! The music in this movie is also extremely good, great soundtrack, I listen to it a lot. So... In short, go see the movie AND buy the soundtrack, you won't be sorry.
