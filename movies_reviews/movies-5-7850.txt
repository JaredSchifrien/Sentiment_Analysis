Great movie.Jack Nicholson plays nasty Melvin who cannot be nice to others and has terrible insults for almost everyone. He has a crush on a waitress played by Helen Hunt. His neighbor a gay man who is an artist is attacked and put in the hospital. Melvin is forced to take care of the neighbors dog while the man is in the hospital.things change from that point on Melvin grows to like the dog and he becomes a nicer person. he helps out the waitress who has a sick son. I like the fact that this little dog makes a change for the better in a man who could not reach out to others, Melvin slowly changes into a nicer person { not perfect, but nicer.} I loved the movie and still enjoy watching it.
