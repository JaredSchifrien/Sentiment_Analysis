For all it being stupid and dumb, I really, really enjoyed this movie! I couldn't stop laughing. It is stupid and dumb and insane, yt somehow it manages to work. Ashton is great in this flick. Taken as a a work of art, it really isn't that good of a movie. Simple and predictable plot, bathroom humour and lously acting. Usually this means a diaster, but with this film, it somehow works. One of the first DVD's IJR bought when I got my dvd player. A classic!
