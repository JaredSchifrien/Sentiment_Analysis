I wish this movie would have been hours longer. The story was compelling as was the love between them. I think that in our American history books we glorify people and gloss over reality in exchange for heroes. This movie showed what I believe was a much more accurate description of the average soldier, ignorant and narrow-minded. This movie was a masterpiece!
