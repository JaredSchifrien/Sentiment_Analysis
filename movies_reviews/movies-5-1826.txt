great movie. plenty of action. Brilliant acting, particularly from Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday, with his witty remarks. The only downfall of the movie would be the love scenes which seem as though they are in the movie simply because they had to be. However, these scenes are few and the rest of the movie is very entertaining. Whoever it is saying Clint Eastwood is in this movie, you've got the wrong film.
