A low end scale 5... a very good movie, but the ending could of used to be shorter (come on, it would've been easy). Also every time I think this is my fav LOTR movie by far, I get reminded of how cool The Two Towers is and how well edited it is. The only reason the end (and a few other eliments) bugs me so much, is because the rest of the movie is so damn awesome... I'm just nit picking cause there's not much there to not like.
