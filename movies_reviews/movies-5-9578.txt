I read this book a year or two ago and absolutely hated it. I'm still not a big fan of Fielding, but I did enjoy this movie very much. I'm not quite sure why, but I found it very charming. I liked that Bridget was kinda chunky but she still got her groove on and was still sexy. I have a new respect for Renee Zellweger after watching this film-not only was her British accent not especially horrible, she played Bridget with a lovely mix of humor and thoughtfulness. And I absolutley LOVE Colin Firth and thought he played the dry, witty, Mark Darcy very well. (Interesting note: he played Mr. Darcy in the A E version of Pride and Predjudice, the novel on which B.J.D is based, somewhat loosley in my opinion.) Hugh Grant is surprisingly good and less floppy in this movie too. In all, I would highly recommend this movie to any romantic comedy movie fan. I love the last scene.
