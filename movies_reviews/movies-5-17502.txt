I am a sucka for hard, urban violence flicks (Clockwork Orange, Scar Face, Taxi Driver, Reservoir Dogs, Traffic, Tesis, etc.). Thus, this one is definitely worth paying adult, full price to see once again in my book. Many would classify this piece as Pulp Fiction-esque yet ignoring the fact that the characters are not as self-righteous and confident as Senior Tarantino s talented and expensive cast. Inarrit s crew is 100% Chilango (people from Mexico City) and hated and loved by the rest of Mexico. These ambivalent feelings are manifested in their internal love/hate of self. People from Mexico City are the political, economic, and talent of the country (exemplified by having LA, New York and DC all in one major big city). 3 of Mexico s social strata are pictured in this trilogy bonded by a car crash. In these chosen social strata, all heroes are deflated to the fullest extent: by showing their not so instinctive betrayal nature (oxymoron). This portrayed serves to be more vicious than the numerous dogs mutilating scenes. There is betrayal between man and women, man and daughter, and between brothers. There is no ideal man nor WOMAN so don t hope to leave the theater identifying with someone, per se. Nevertheless, however implicit, there is an (un)certain sense of hope for these vicious heroes. Throughout the flick, there is an undying and un-denying sense of unconditional love between a few and very well thought-out relationships.
