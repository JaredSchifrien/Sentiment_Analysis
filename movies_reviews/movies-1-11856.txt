Unless you enjoy watching a grumpy, drunk, jerk say the f word every 5 minutes, then I do not recommend this movie. Billy Bob plays such a miserable character it makes the movie painful to watch. Then in the last scene when he tries to redeem himself its too little too late, and seems way too unlikely that such a loser would FINALLY develope any sort of compassion. Dont waste your time.
