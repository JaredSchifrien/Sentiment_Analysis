This movie lived up to the hype. The character driven comedy was very funny and the overall feel of this film was charming. One of the best things about it was the fact that they didn't follow the usual romantic comedy plotline. These two never broke up because of a misunderstanding and got back together like all those other movies. This is a smart, well put together comedy worth watching a time or two.
