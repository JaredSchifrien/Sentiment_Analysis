One the best parodies I have ever had the joy of watching - several dozen times! So many hilarious and memorable lines - just thinking about them cracks me up. The entire cast is excellent but Clevon Little, Gene Wilder and Madeline Kahn are priceless. There are too many great parts in this movie to actually say I have a favorite. I just start laughing at I get no kick from Champagne and don't stop until Clevon and Gene drive off into the sunset. Some of the greatest comic therapy available!
