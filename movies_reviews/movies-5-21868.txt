Absolutly perfect movie in all areas. It adds comedy, action, adventure, and sci-fi all into one! It's definatly my favorate movie! Did you know that a couple months ago, it was number 3 on the list of MOST sold DVD's? and guess what, the DVD doesn't even come out untill December 17, 2002! That shows it all. Buy it, pre-order it. Don't even bother to rent it first, its worth the money.
