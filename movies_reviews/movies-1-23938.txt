Really dumb movie. It seemed like a movie made by the green party to convince us to stop driving cars or this will happen to us. It's totally ridiculous. The whole United States was destroyed but they were saved by moving to Mexico. Not only is the script reallly dumb but the special effect weren't impressive either. Hardly watchable.
