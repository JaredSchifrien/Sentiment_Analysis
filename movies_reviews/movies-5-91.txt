No wonder this film sweeped the board at the Oscars. Hopkins is fantastic in this. His stone cold stare is chilling in itself. The Hopkins/Foster partnership is gripping. Excellent plot and well written. The other lambs prequel and sequels haven't quite cut it for me. This film will have it's place at the top of the all time greats forever.
