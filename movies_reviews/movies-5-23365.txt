When I was a teenager our family first got cable TV in the early 80s and they would play this movie on HBO all the time. The scene where Max's wife and child are killed gave me nightmares. The movie is an excellent story of a grief-stricken man getting revenge. The sequels were weaker and sunk deeper into far fetched science fiction and special effects.
