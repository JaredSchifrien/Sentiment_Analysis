I can't believe nobody has commented on this doc. They let the camera do the talking, those conventions are something else. I appreciate hobbies that become cultures but the Trek world is truly vast and well, nerdy. That whole bit with "Commander" was just too much, I'd piss myself laughing if anybody demanded I address them by their Startfleet rank.
