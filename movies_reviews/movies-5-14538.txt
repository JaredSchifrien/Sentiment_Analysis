I thought Cast Away was a good movie. Tom Hanks as good as a man who worked for FedEX. His plane crashes and he ends up on a tiny deserted island. He has to find a way to survive for the next four years. He opens one of the FEDEX boxes that washed to shore and finds a volley ball he decorates and calls it Wilson.The only thing he has to talk to. His hope of getting rescued to get back to his girlfriend. This movie has drama, humor, and sadness for the main character.i do not want to give too much away. This movie is a little too long. We found it too be a good movie.
