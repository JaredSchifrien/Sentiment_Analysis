Trully the best of the Alien saga, this is a classic Sci-fi with intrigue and probably the best crafted back story I have ever seen. This movie was left completely open for a great sequel and it is a pity it never happened. HR Giger was a genius with the Alien design. The greatest part was the questions the movie left the viewer asking. A little mystery is always good. Anyone who does not like this movie simply does not understand it. Tom Skerrit, Sigourteny Weaver, Yaffat Koto, and John Hurt were great. Definately a great movie for Ridley Scott. The music by Jerry Goldsmith was great. Everyone must see this movie.
