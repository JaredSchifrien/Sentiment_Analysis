Holy craparoonie!!! WHY is this animated slice of Nirvana this far back? Granted, it came out awhile ago, but stick it on a plasma screen and watch it dazzle your retinas!! Old-school showcase for meticulous paintwork that STILL can't be done on computer to any satisfying length. What it suffers in cultural curiosities is more than made up for in sheer scope and chutzpah. Count me an avowed fan.
