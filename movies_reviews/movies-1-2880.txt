Boy, is this an awful movie! I watched about 25 minutes of it and couldn't take any more. It was extremely violent, and the plot was difficult to follow. John Travolta was just terrible in his role, and I was appalled by Halle Berry. She should be ashamed of herself for taking a part in which her claim to fame is showing off her breasts in gratuitous nude scenes. Talk about pathetic! There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this film- avoid it at all costs.
