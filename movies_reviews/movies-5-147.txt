One of the best horror/thriller movies of the 90s. Anthony Hopkins is perfect as Hannibal the Cannibal Lector, and Jodie Foster who usually annoys me does a great job as the inexperienced but determined Agent Starling. This movie comes back to haunt me occasionally, because a friend of mine does a funny-but-also-upsetting imitation of the scene where the guy says, She puts the lotion in the bucket If you enjoyed Silence of the Lambs, you should also check out a great but lesser-known movie called Manhunter. It was based on a book (called Red Dragon ) written by Thomas Harris the same guy who wrote Silence of the Lambs.
