this wasn't a good war movie. some things in this movie are not true to history. in some of the battle scenes, the japanese soldiers appear to be bad soldiers. in some scenes, most of the soldiers couldn't kill the american standing right in front of them. in reality, the japanese soldiers were the some of the best trained in the entire world. i think Cage is too old to play this part. he's almost 40 and he's playing a marine sergeant. he's too old for the part. If your haven't noticed from watching the movie, everything is off. The american grenades make an explosion the size of a artillery shell. The Japanese soldiers are shown as having no hand to hand combat skills. Terrible historical film.
