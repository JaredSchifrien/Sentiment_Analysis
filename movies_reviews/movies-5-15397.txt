This movie is the best movie i have ever seen. This is my new favorite all time movie. This movie goes to show you that race should not be a factor if you want a relationship cause all you have to do is live your dream. This movie i recommend for everyone to see. Julia Stiles is a wonderful actress and Sean Patrick Thomas is a great actor. Those two make a great team. So go and see this movie cause i know you will love it.
