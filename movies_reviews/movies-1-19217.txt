This is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. For some reason, I watched it until the bitter end. I guess I was hoping, praying, begging for a twist. I was thinking, there is no way that this movie can really be this AWFUL. The acting was a joke, the plot bordered on hilarious (not a compliment for a so-called horror movie) and the writing was a bomb from the very beginning. If you want to see a bunch of actors in their worst roles ever with really awful effects..go and waste a couple hours of your life and rent From Dusk Till Dawn!
