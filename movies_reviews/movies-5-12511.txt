This is an awesome move. The movie was beautifully directed and skillfully acted. I am sorry to break it to all those who have not seen this movie and refuse to see it because of their homophobic fears but I foresee at least one oscar coming for the movie. The sexual seens and the kissing were a very small part of this movie. It was a story of true love and the results of what happens in life when men try to please society rather than their hearts. Ladies and Gent.... this is life!!
