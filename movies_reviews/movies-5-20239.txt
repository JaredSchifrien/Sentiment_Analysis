Sraight up the most awesome display of movie making in the horror genre. A tight script, excellent direction and a pretty talented no-name cast. Only person in it I know by name is Kelly Preston. She plays the damsel in distress that gets undressed pretty well. Take heed! Pay attention the entire movie or it will pass you by. And be prepared for the ending.... it WILL SHOCK you!
