Robin Williams gave it his best shot to become accepted as a bonified Human ..! The longer the movie played the more involved it became. Great specail effects and thoroughly enjoyed. Except for the ending...don't take this wrong Robin Williams...but your supposed to keep us laughing our virtual butts off....got that? But you somehow managed to bring it into the realms of real tears. So knock that tears stuff off Mr. WIlliams or... No-More 'Dura Cell' Batterys for you dude. Got that?
