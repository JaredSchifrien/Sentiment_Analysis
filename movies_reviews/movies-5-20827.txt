With me working at my local cinema, i must say that this film has been the most enjoyable one to view. I first thought that this, as a musical, would be dry and only apealing to the fans who had seen the west-end verison, but i was proved wrong as the whole film was extreamly entertaining! The plot wasnt outstanding but the singing and acting abilties of the performers was brilliant. The bright and up-beat songs kept the whole audience in awe and the costumes were just perfect. I personaly love this movie...its definatly one to sing along to! It isnt for the younger audience but for teen-agers and above its a great film to watch and is a much wanted release from the serious and dominating movies this year.
