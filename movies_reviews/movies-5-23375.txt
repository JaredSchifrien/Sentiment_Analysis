You have to expect that any film written by Charlie Kaufman is going to be a little unusual - and Eternal Sunshine certainly is. The plot is crazy - after his girlfriend breaks up with him, Joel (Jim Carrey) learns that she has undergone a radical procedure to erase all memories of him from her brain. Joel is so devastated by the breakup, and heartbroken by his 'erasure' from the memories of his ex, he too decides to go for the procedure. As he is undergoing the procedure, he realizes subconsciously that he DOESN'T want this girl erased from him. That despite all of the pain and heartbreak, he desperately needs to remember. THis begins a desperate game of hide and seek in Carrey's subconscious as Carrey tries to protect his memories from the 'erasers.' As bizarre as the plot sounds, the film is EXTREMELY well done, with stunning performances from Carrey (who I've never liked) and Winslet. The film touches on things like fate and moving on from the heartbreak of a lost love, in a way that is creative, hilarious, and touching. One of the better films I've seen in a while.
