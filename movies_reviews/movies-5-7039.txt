It seems like this movie is on TNT or TBS or USA every week, but I catch myself watching it each time. It is very funny and Matthew Broderick is at his best. Whatever happened to his hot girlfriend? I don't remember seeing her in anything else which is truly unfortunate. There is also a collection of actors in the film who would go on to bigger things (Charlie Sheen, Jennifer Grey, Ben Stein, Alan Ruck-Stuart on Spin City). I would be surprised if there is anyone who hasn't actually seen this movie, but if you haven't, it should be your next rental/purchase choice.
