Wow. I've seen this movie twice, but it never ceases to captivate me. I cry with him, I feel his hunger and his loss, I realize his fear. Adrien Brody was simply incredible in this role -- I can think of no one who could have done it better. One of the most powerful scenes is when he is walking down the street crying and there are hundreds of suitcases and belongings strewn on the sidewalks and in the road. I also like the fact that a German soldier is portrayed in a favorable light -- he helped Wladyslaw when things weren't looking so good. He also spared Wladyslaw's life (and in real life, the lives of other Jews) but was still imprisoned by the Russians after the surrender in Europe and subsequently died in a POW camp years later. So tragic, and so unjust.
