wow, not just a baseball movie. I loved it for a variety of reasons, but I really think that 'baseball' was just a vehicle for the expression of sorrow, regret, and reconciliation between a father and a son. Watched it maybe a dozen times, the last 20 minutes always chokes me up. We all look at our parents differently when we get older. We usually get an opportunity to mend fences. Kevin Costner's character had no way to reconcile with his dad, except thru the field of dreams. James Earl Jones is great in a supporting role and provides many, many great quotes in the final scenes of the movie.
