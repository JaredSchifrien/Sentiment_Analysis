One of the best Bond films ever. Pierce Brosnan is everything a bond should be and Halle Berry is everything a bond-girl should be. The story has some nice little twists and John Cleese is wonderful as Q's replacement R. The whole subway scene has a real Third Man feel to it. Toby stephens is a mediocre villain, but Rosamund Pike is wonderful as his accomplice. Best Scene: The Car Fight
