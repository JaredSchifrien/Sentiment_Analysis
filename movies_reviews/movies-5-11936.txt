This was a great surprise to me as well as my daughter. I don't really like Katie Holmes movies, and have her stereotyped in my own mind to Dawson's Creek, but April was a very well done film. I think that it will fall through the cracks as it is more of an 'art type' film, but I would recommend it to everyone, give it a chance.
