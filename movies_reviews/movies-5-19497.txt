I happen to love this movie and the sequels that followed. The twisted train of thought put into this has to be admired. Maybe the camera work was less than perfect, the lighting wasn't the best and the amatuer acting was difficult at times but the story will carry you to the end of the movie if you let it. This movie requires some thinking to follow and as you will read below, some people don't participate in that function while watching movies. It really is a great film and the sequels will leave you laughing and give you a little thrill as well.
