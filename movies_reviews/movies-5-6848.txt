This movie is hilarious. I watched it in my 9th grade history class when learning about the Middle Ages and it definitely does have educational value. It uses satire regarding life in Medieval Europe. This is seen especially when the brilliant writers of the movie mocked the constant warfare in Europe when the guy had both of his arms and legs cut off and still continued to make an attempt at fighting. A great piece of political commentary.
