Come on, how can anyone that calls him/herself a Christian give any less than 5 stars? I feel everyone has a right to thier own opinion but I also feel if you don't feel anything from watching this masterpiece, you are not in touch w/your Maker. Mel did an excellent job w/ this movie. The casting was excellent. I can't say that anyone could have played Jesus better than Jim. What an outstanding experience. As for people who saw nothing in this film and those of you who are atheist and agnostic's, I will pray for you. :o)
