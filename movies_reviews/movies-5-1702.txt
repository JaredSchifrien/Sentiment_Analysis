I thoroughly enjoyed this movie - in large part because of its uniqueness. I have not had the opportunity to see a lot of films from the martial arts genre, and I have to admit, I was not expecting the depth that this movie delivered. The cinematography was amazing, the gravity defying fight scenes were possibly the best that I have ever seen, and the characters were compelling. This movie delivers comedy, romance, and action in a very non-traditional way - I don't think you will be disappointed.
