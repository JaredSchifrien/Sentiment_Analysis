I rented the Shawshank Redemption because I had taken an online survey about movies I liked and disliked. this movie forum would then take my ratings of movies and reccomend movies they thought I would like. I was surprised when they said the Shawshank Redemption. Me, like a movie about prison? I was sure they must be mistaken. Well I rented it and loved it. Tim Robbins,was great as the man who was wrongly accused of a double murder. He ended up in prison for decades. Morgan Freeman was also good as a fellow prisoner.I was expecting a movie about lots of violence and was surprised to find out it was more about how tim Robbins character survived his decades in prison and his victory in the end.A bit too long but a great movie.
