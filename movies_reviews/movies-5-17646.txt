Best Scandinavian film ever! :o) The second best European film in '98 after La vita bella! And in a year with under average films like Shakespear In Love Saving Private Ryan, it was even the second best film in the world in '98! Nominated to Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film, but Central do Brasil won, a film I don't think is as good as Festen. It was wrong not to nominate it to Oscar for BFLF! Festen isn't just good, it's also important! The topic, childrens' relation with their parents is still a holy tabu.
