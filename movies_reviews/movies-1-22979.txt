Confusing, irritating, absolutely no plot at all and annoying music. 90% of the time it was just abstract pictures and special effects with absolutely no meaning. The few interactions between the characters were boring and I still think they were the least worst parts of the movie. My sister went shopping right after the movie had begun and when she returned 2 hours later she asked me why it was still in the same place as when she left. To sum it up: There are surely better things to do with your time. Not even worth renting. People only praise it because they think it makes them look intellectual.
