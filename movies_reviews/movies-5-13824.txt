This is without question one of the most poetic and heart breaking movies ever made. It is beautiflly written,directed and photographed and it has one of the best casts ever assembled for ANY movie. Oh yeah and there is Stanley Myers breathtaking theme cavatina playing throughout. In short this is one movie you should watch before you die!!!!
