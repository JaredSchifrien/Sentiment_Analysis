A masterpiece. My favorite science-fiction and philosophy film ever (well, how many are there, really?) I presume everyone knows that if you add one to all the letters in HAL you get IBM ... Kubrick's films are always full of subtleties like that. I see new things in this film every time I see it, and I have never tired of it. It has something of Moby Dick in its epic, heroic scale.
