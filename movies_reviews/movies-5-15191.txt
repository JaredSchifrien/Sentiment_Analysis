A fine family film if there ever was one. I didn't realize that Seabiscuit was as popular as he was until I saw this film. It not only leaves you with a good feeling at the end of the movie, it also leaves you wanting to know more about him. I went directly after the movie and bought Laura Hillenbrand's book on which the film was based just so I could read the complete story. I highly recommend everyone go see this, even if you're not a horse fan.
