I've said it before and I'll say it again. I love what Peter Jackson has done. He's taken an epic book series, and turned it into 3 absolutly fantastic movies! He can take made up characters and creatures and turn them into real living walking things! Only Tolkien could create a walking, talking tree, or a place like the dead marshes. This first movie really gives us a look inside Tolkiens imagination. You really get to see what went on in his mind as he was creating these epic characters. I mean, Aragorn, Elrond, Legolas, it's all there. Then he went through the process of creating races. Like Elves who can walk on snow instead of sinking. Wizards, who fight each other with staffs. A huge eye that can see everything. Orcs and Uruk-hai. Everything. It's just incredible! Peter, then had to do the work of creating Tolkiens book and making it come to life. Elijah ,Sean A, Billy and Dom, all had to go through, putting the feet on and the ears. Orlando, Liv and all the other hundreds of extra elves went through hours of makeup- costumes,ears and contacs. Peter has done a fantastic job! This movie captures the beginning of an amazing journey through not only middle earth, but time as well. Very well done, and the next 2 get even better!
