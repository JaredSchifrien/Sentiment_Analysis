an absolute joy to watch matt damons best ever character, and jay and silent bob are at their absolute best in this feature, i have this on vhs and it is now unwatchable due to the wear and tear it has endured, and the religious factor is beautifully done. i could go on for hours about this movie but i wont(no applause needed).
