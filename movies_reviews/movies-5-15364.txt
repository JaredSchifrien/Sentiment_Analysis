Blue Velvet is a master work of the phenominal director, David Lynch. One of his most noteworthy works and well deserving to be. Was nominated for best picture and best director in 1986. Very surreal and beautiful with great symbolism through out. Another masterpiece from artist David Lynch. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
