The critics such as my home paper the Courier Journal who gave Life As A House 2 out of 4 stars and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution who gave it a C+ have gone blind, deaf, dumb, and loony. This was one of the two best movies I have seen all year. Hayden Christensen is probably a good bet for Best Supporting Actor unless some amazing film comes along. When i read the plotline of the movie, it sounded really dumb to me, but I dragged myself along anyway. Was I ever wrong! If you are getting fed up with the crap that is currently invading the theatres, see Life As A House . Take care, everyone!
