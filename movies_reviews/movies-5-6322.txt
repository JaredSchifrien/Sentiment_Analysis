Under-estimated by critics at the time of its release, The Great Escape has proven over the years to be a true classic, entertaining the newer generations as well as the old. It's simply great adventure, with landmark roles for most of its stars. Although it's Steve Mcqueen with his legendary bravura and motorcyle adventures who has raised the most attention, my personal favourite is James Garner with his under-stated, tongue-in-cheek performance as the scrounger who gathers all the essential materials for the escape and builds an unlikely friendship with his very English room mate, Donald Pleasance (tea without milk is so uncivilized). However, the rest of the cast are all perfect in their roles as well.
