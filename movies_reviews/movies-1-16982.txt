This is up there with one of the five worst movies I've ever seen. Two hours of my life I'll never get back! For those of you who think this depicts real life, I feel very sorry for you. This negative, immoral, movie was one of the most depressing representation of humanity I have ever seen. Although, it IS a study in bad decisions humans make every day in their lives. If this is what is going on in modern-day relationships, I feel very sorry for this generation. However, in all of my experience, I see less of this kind of muck, and more people trying to behave. I used to LIKE Clive Owens, and the weird thing is, in real life, he's happily married with a couple of kids! I certainly didn't think this movie did anything for Jude Law's or Julia Robert's careers! If this is life, then leave me out of it. I felt like taking a shower at the end of this movie I found it so disgusting (and, believe it or not, I'm NOT a prude). For those of you who know people who live this way - GET NEW FRIENDS! Sorry, but life is too short to waste on people who have no idea that happiness resides within, not jumping from bed to bed!
