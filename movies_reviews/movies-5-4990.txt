Proving that unreal isn't uncool. This very cool and funny movie focuses on animals. The dogs have to save the world from the cats. There's not only slapstick and dog jokes, but nods to Get Smart, James Bond and other spy shows. The cast is great and the special effects, in a word, rock. Highly recommended!
