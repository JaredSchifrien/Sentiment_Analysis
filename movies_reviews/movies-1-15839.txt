While reading your opinions on this movie I was astonished. In all sincerity I can't image how you guys could have possibly seen this movie for more than a vulgar pornographic flick. I can't believe that seventeen year old children can walk in off the street and see this film, for this our society's moral standards should be reviewed. One would have to agree that all played their roles well..they were all full of emotion and very dramatic. Still I just can't see how anyone would find a film that makes sex look so dirty, so amazingly good. Most at our show left appauled. Anyone who enjoys this movie would have to be slightly twisted and lacking something in their own sexual relations. I just really feel that this movie should have been rated NC-17.
