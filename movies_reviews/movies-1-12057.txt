I personally thought this movie was absolutly pathetic. The only way you can enjoy this movie is to be stoned. The movie is about losing a car on a night of being trashed and on the trip to retrievel they stumble upon clues of what they did last night. Who really cares about where thier car is. I can't believe I even payed to see this movie. Someone shoot me! I think the whole time i laughed once. They ruined every joke by out doing themselves, too much stupid acting for simple little jokes.
