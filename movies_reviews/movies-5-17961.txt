The Exorcist is by far one of the greatest films of all time. It is chilling and at times a bit disturbing. The movie has an extremly well done screenplay and the cast plays their roles respectfully, and nicely. Regan Macneil is a 12-year old girl who is having some problems. She always seems to be doing crazy things, like throwing up and making messes, and cursing at her mother. The doctors are stumped, but not the exorcist. Regan is being possessed by the devil, and her only hope is an exorcisum. They call upon Father Marrin, and it works.
