I am an Australian and hvae juts watched 'Bowlinf for Columbine. I think that Moore has done a fantastic job of this documentary. I was shocked. Aboslutely stunned and disgusted. The way Americans go around with guns is very wrong. I found it very emotional, and right fully so. The scene from inside Columbine High were enough to make me cry. how disgraceful tat such a hting could happen! Whjat is America doing to make this happen?! I know many Americas are angry at being portayed in a negative way, but please deal with it. Most of you are decent people, BUT anyone who agrees with what Charles Heston did, going to Columbine to promote guns a day after the shooting and also where the six yera old innocent girl was shot, to be all happy, hahaa, own a gun, its so great blah blah blah ITS TOTALLY UNACCPETABLE! how disrespectful! What a waste of life that man is! I was also shocked at how America gave money to Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden. Well whats happening now?!?!? oh we hate Hussein, oh kill Osama! They are murderers... Weel take a look in the mirror!!! Abosolutely disgusting. Whether the claims are true or not, and i wil admit maybe moore was too interetsed in money, he has stil opened my eyes to things maybe i wihs i could close my eyes on again, and i know America wants to do tat, BUT DOT! open them!!!!! MAKE YOUR GUN LAWS STRICTER!! save the children. I love Columbine! (also how disgusting the gun trucs had 'we are columbine on them!) thankyou Mr Moore, 'Bowling for Columine' was truly AMAZING!
