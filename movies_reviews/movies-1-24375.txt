Amittyville meets 2001. Really a nifty idea. Too bad it failed miserably. Beyond the flashy and cool visual effect lies an incredibly poorly written and badly put together peice of sci-fi rubish. A great premise is waisted on cute and cliche teeny bop horror ploys that are so predictable even an unbore fetus could detect them. This film does however in the early moments give off a very creepy undertone. It keeps you hooked to the movie in hope throughout all the crap something genuinly scary and original will pop out and blow you away which unfortunatly never comes. Very disapointing and worth missing. Cool music though.
