I Love this book and movie so much. My favorite part of both has to be everything with Boo Radly. I find that because i am around Jems age, 14 i can relate how myseterious things are to kids. I think that everyone has also had somthing like that in there childhood. I also think it is the best movie and book ever, they should rellay consider these more. It doesnt have a lot of action, but it doesnt need it. Seeing Robert Duvall as Boo Radley was exciting enough!!!
