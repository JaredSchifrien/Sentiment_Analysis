Are any of y'all preachers? I've got a confession to make. Main reason I gave this a five was because It features two of my favorite songs by my all-time favorite rock group ( Bohemian Rhapsody and Another One Bites the Dust ). But the other main reason I liked it was simply because it was an amazing movie! Funny, full of heart, and leaves you with a warm feeling. Like Dorkavitch said, the scene where the crazy dudes sing Bohemian Rhapsody in the car, is downright hilarious! If any of y'all haven't seen Wayne's World, I 1000% reccomend it. Take care everyone!
