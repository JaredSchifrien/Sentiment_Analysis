Shrek was an excellent movie. I love these family oriented films that have a really deep meaning. I actually shed a tear during the scene where all the main characters had separated after Shrek thought Fiona didn't really want him and that sad song was playing. They were all thinking about each other and it was just a moving moment for me (I had just broken up with me significant other myself lol). Just a great film, very funny too.
