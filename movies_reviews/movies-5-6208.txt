 Stella....Stella.... I read the play before I saw the movie and usually the movies disappoint after you read the play or book but 'Streetcar Named Desire' is an exception. Marlon Brando is absolutely perfect in this movie. The acting was unbelieveable. I really liked the story. Even though this movie is in b w (black and white) it keeps your attention the whole way through. Definitely a time piece. You see the South (New Orleans) back in the 60's. Great movie.
