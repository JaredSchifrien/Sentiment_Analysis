Just as Michael Moore spread lies about America in Farenheight 9/11 because he actually hates America, I have no doubt Spurlock used this as anti-fast food propaganda. Putting aside the fact that a reality movie should never be made, this movie is biased in the fact that McDonald's is all he eats. I mean, he doesn't even take any nutritional supplements for goodness sakes. Even I, a fast food fan, know that you can't eat fast food every meal and that vitamins are necessary for optimal operation. Even more, this movie is so anti-fast food as to make me sick. As I believe someone said, Give me Chick-Fil-A or give me death!
