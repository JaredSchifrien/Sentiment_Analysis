I think this movie was very stupid. I think the writers got carried away. As if the 1st and second movie weren't bad enough they had to add a 3rd. Now is this movie really considered a horror or what? I'd call it a joke. It made me shake my head instead of grabbing my seat. How about the part of not needing a condom because it's all rubber baby. How dumb.
