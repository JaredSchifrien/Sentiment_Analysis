This is probably one of the most legendary low budget movies. As opposed to the Blair Witch Project, in the case of this film not only the actors are hysterical, but also the viewers get their share of madness. The special effects and filming techniques that were used in a sometimes quite experimental manner were an absolute novelty at the time and add to the involvement of the audiences into this extremely scary and bloody movie.
