Released in 1986, Ferris Bueller's Day Off is one of those John Hughes' films that is now part of the common American experience, especially for those who grew up in the Big 80's. Local legend Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is the hippest guy in high school and decides that it would be a shame to waste a perfect day in class; therefore, he calls in sick and drags his friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), who is actually under the weather, and his girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) along for the ride; however, school principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) and his secretary (Edie McClurg) are not fooled for long. During Bueller's much needed vacation, the trio take off in a classic Ferrari owned by Cameron's dad, hit the tourist spots in Chicago, and crash a parade while Ferris pontificates on his philosophies of life. Nevertheless, Rooney is out to spoil the party and make Bueller repeat his senior year. Supporting the core cast are Jennifer Grey as Ferris' straight-laced sister Jeanie who hopes that Ferris gets caught, Cindy Pickett and Lyman Ward as his parents, a short appearance by Charlie Sheen, and Ben Stein as one of Ferris' teachers. This film would not have reached cult status without the performance by Broderick, his philosophical asides, and the then contemporary teenaged themes. Everyone wanted to be like Bueller and knew someone like him (in fact, my sister still calls me Ferris), an underdog who is fighting the system. The bottom line is that Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a cult movie that has become part of the lexicon. (Note, Alan Ruck was 30 years old when he played Cameron.)
