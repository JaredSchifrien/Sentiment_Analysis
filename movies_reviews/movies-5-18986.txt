Sam Raimi did a terrific with Army of Darkness, the third installment of the Evil Dead series. This horror\comedy went for more of the slapstick funny jokes, which differed from its predecessors. The snappy dialogue by Bruce Campbell along with the visual effects makes this the best of the trilogy. Unlike most horror movies, where the bad guy returns from the dead, this one is based solely upon the stupidity of the good guy. This movie even had a decent plot that flowed well with all the events.
