I loved The Animal . When I went to see it, I was expecting yet another pointless comedy with no real storyline and a lot of bad jokes. I was surprised to discover that, while this movie is definately a comedy, it also had some depth and some serious moments. I couldn't help but feel sorry for Marvin, the police officer wannabe who cannot seem to do anything right. He was a well thought out character, with some depth that is unusual for a comedy. Five stars!
