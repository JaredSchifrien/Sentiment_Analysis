I thought this was an excellent movie. Very touching. The relationship between the father and son, how it changes and develops, how the characters react to Kevin Kline's cancer and what he's doing or trying to do before he dies is interesting to watch. It's a movie that makes a person think. I might be a little slanted in how I feel about this movie because I have cancer but I think anyone would like this movie. It's mostly about relationships. Husbands, wives, children, ex's, neighborbs, a whole web of characters.
