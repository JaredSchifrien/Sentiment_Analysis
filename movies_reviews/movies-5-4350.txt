I don't know as I would say it's a kids movie at all, though, I'm sure they would enjoy it also. It has a wonderful message and was a delight to watch laughing like crazy one minute and shed a tear or two the next. Alot of fun to watch. Shatters some of the fairy tale ideals we had to grow up with-finally. Highly recommend
