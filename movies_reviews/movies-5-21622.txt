The novie had great action throughtout almost the whole thing. It had great effects and they picked good actors for the parts. I really like the job they did they did not stick entirly to the book but what movie really does?? It would be too hard to recreate a whole book and the movie would be much too long. I have read the books and they are good too. The movie captures the main parts of the books though like the Mines of Moria. Peter Jackson picked a great book to make a movie out of. I would recommened this movie to anyone who likes action, adventure, romance, and horror. It has all of the essentials to a great movie.
