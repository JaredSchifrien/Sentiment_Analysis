Such an intense movie. It's one of those films that is so vivid and moving that it's hard to believe it could happen. Everytime you see it you notice something new, I found myself looking at the expressions on people faces, people not directly focused on but people in the background to see the whole picture. I'm not explaining this very well but what I'm trying to say is that so many of the camp scenes felt so real that I felt like I was looking at a piece of history in the way you look at old photographs and stare at the details of faces and places that no longer exist. The way the clothes hung on peoples bodies the looks on their faces, their shoes, it was like the pictures jumped to life and you were able to see the events before and after the shutter closed.
