I'm still on Planet Earth right?!?!? Hello!! People work with me here. Where to begin, where to begin. How 'bout I walked out of this film in the first half hour and demanded my money back! I couldn't believe what a parody this was of the first one. I didn't think the first one was fantastic but at least it stayed in line with the type of visuals, acting, and suspense of the show. This thing was just a non-stop oh my god is this cheesey scene after another. When he's rock climbing and jumps 20 feet and DOWN to his right and slides down the rock face until he suddenly grips a protrubing pebble?!!? Then he decides to turn himself around and hang for a couple of minutes while he stares off into space with a Goddamn I'm cool look on his face. Or the bathtub scene, or the dance floor, or the two cars doing 360 after 360 stuck together. Give me a break!
