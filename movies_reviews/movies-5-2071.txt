One of the best movies starring the ever wonderful Keanu Reeves. Not only is he an outstanding actor in every way, but he is very good looking. If anyone brought the movie to a lower level it would have been Sandra Bullock. But even she did a really good job compared to usual. A wonderful movie jam-packed with action and excitement from beginning to end...I highly recommend it...
