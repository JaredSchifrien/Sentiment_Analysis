Before I saw this movie, I did not care for Ashton Kutcher. I thought he was silly and boring. But when I watched this movie, He amazed me! He has such good acting range! His character made me smile and cry. This is a truly well constructed film with an original tale. No other time travel film can top The Butterfly Effect, not even future Sci-Fi films can aspire to these standards!
