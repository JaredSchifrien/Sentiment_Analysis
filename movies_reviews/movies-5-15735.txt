This was one hell of a movie! I must have watched it like what, two.. hundred... thousand times, and the only reason that I stopped watching it is that my VCR broke. Bloody marvellous.. Keanu was really great in that movie and so was Charlize Theron. She is so beautiful it hurts! And no, I`m not gay. This movie has explicit sex scenes, full frontal nudity, it`s R rated. But thats not why I like it so much. I don`t even know why I like it so much. It is just so good, it`s got something that appeals to me. It is not too believable, and the make-sense factor is probably 3 out of 10, but the overall impression I got was that the movie was superb. I`m a humanist, I rest my case . And Keanu totally ruled the screen, because he actually acted, what a big step for him! Whoever did the casting in this movie did a very good job, because they figured everything right: people would come watch the movie because Keanu Reeves would be in it (that`s always a good sign) and then there was very impressive acting by Al Pacino, and a few side characters, so the great overall effect would be attained. Bottom line, the movie rocked, but then again, what movie doesn`t when it`s based on a good book and has got a big budget?
