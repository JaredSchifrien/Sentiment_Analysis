I hated this movie. I REALLY hated this movie. They don't really explain anything until the last lines of the movie. I figured out what the 21 grams was supposed to be about early on and still the movie didn't make any sense. It just seemed like a horrible story without any meaning behind it. Sean Penn does a good job, and if you're a young horny male you'd be interested to know that you get to see Naomi Watts naked. But those are the only possible things I could ever see anyone liking about this movie. It sucked.
