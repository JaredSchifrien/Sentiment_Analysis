another one for the airheads...while the movie made a concerted effort at a spoof, the tasteless writing makes one want to gag (no pun intended)...constantly falls back on every lobotomized producers fail-safe fall-back for a zero: the f-word...not the least bit 'funny', but obviously the age genre this movie is geared towards would not know the difference...
