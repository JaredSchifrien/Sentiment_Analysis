This is probably the second worst movie I've seen in a long time. I watched it with two other people and they both thought the same. The storyline is bad, simple-minded, and unexploited. The characters were weak, and the supporting actresses/actors were bad. The action/fighting scenes weren't very good either. But that's not even the worst part. The dialogue was literally laughable (the sort you would expect from a weak story-lined action movie ten years ago). Here's one example: Let's just kick some ass! It's what we do best. Even the background music was dis-tasteful, imagine theme music from the game Quake 2, except much much worse. I would recommend saving your money and not going to see this one... if anything wait until it comes out on video.
