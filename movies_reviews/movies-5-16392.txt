One of the coolest movies I've ever seen. I'm hooked on it! It was sexy, dark, and a bit confusing. I didn't get it the first time I saw it, but when I watched it more and more, it became a little bit clearer, but not crystal clear. I am still a little bit unsure in some parts. It's a movie that will keep you guessing, that's for sure. Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring are both very beautiful, too. I think it was so sad when Diane shot herself. That was so tragic. Lynch is stellar!! This is one of his great works.
