I think that The patriot is one of the greatest all-times movie!It was excellent!The acting was great(both from Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger)! The historical accuracy might not be at its best but it does not really matter.The movie does reflect a bit of the I single-handedly saved the world theme that so many American movies have about them,but it was still very good. If I could I would have given it six stars!
