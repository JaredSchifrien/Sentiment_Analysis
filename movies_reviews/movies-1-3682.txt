 Jackie, Jackie, Jackie . . . what on EARTH were you thinking!?! He opted not to do his own stunts for this one, and it was a HUGE disappointment for many Jackie Chan fans. Storyline was lame, but I wasn't expecting Oscar material or anything. Jennifer Love Hewitt just wasn't convincing as a scientist. It was almost painful to watch, and if there are any Jackie Chan fans out there who hasn't seen this, I highly suggest that you spare yourself the pain!
