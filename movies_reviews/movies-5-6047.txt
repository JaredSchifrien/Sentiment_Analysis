It's a stretch to find Grace Kelly and Coop tying the knot but the story is tense and exciting. I guess in the West, such a vast difference in age was not uncommon. The real time moving of the clock is a classic. The score is terrific and the cameos of the slew of character actors really add to it. Coop won a well deserved Oscar.
