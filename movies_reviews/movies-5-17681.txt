Roberto Benigni was the greatest comic actor of his day (he makes dopes like Adam Sandler look like amateurs). Then he became afflicted with the fatal disease all-too-common among great comedians: the wish to be a 'serious' actor, working in 'serious' movies. Too bad. This one is probably his funniest, but 'The Monster' is pretty good too.
