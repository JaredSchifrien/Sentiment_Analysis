An all-time classic. I saw it for the first time today and was completely dazzled, all the way from chilling start to slick, dynamic (and even more chilling) end. If you want a romantic flick that doesn't pile on the sentimentality then this is the place to start heading. One very big puzzlement that arose while watching this powerful and enthralling film, in which a young man finds himself falling in love with the daughter of the woman with whom he is having an affair, was just why so many people always refer to it as a comedy. I thought it was a lot more serious and haunting than funny. The obscure angles from which many sequences were shot were well done and added to the general unease, which Hoffman was successfully able to transfer to the viewers via his character's own fear and insecurity. And the ending was amazing - a real andrenalin inducer that rounded off the perfect film and brought it to a poignent but at the same time uplifting close. Heck, this film is worth watching for the brilliant sound track alone - I only have to hear 'The Sound of Silence' and it makes my heart skip a beat.
