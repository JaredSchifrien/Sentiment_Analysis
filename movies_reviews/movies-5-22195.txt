I love this ingenious movie! The graphics were great and the plot kept me thinking until the end of the movie, which also kept me thinking, what is the next movie going to be like? How will the next one thrill me? This movie deffinately rubbed me the right way. The story was confusing and made me wonder if t his was really going on, but I just brushed it off and that feeling made me realize about 10% more how smart the creation of this movie is. I would reccomend it to anybody that likes to keep wondering 'til the end. GREAT movie!
