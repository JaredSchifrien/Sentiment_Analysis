American President is quite simply, bad. It consists of a couple hours of poorly disguised political dogma veiled over with a relatively weak, boring and predictable love story. Considering that it was brought forth by Annette Bening, Michael Douglas and Rob Reiner, the viewer really cannot expect anything less, and yet again is forced to listen to the pontifications of Bening and Douglas with regard to their political views. I must say that I am quite sick of meathead trying to tell me how to run my life, he should stick to simpler and relatively non-effrontery comedy without political motivations. Additionally, the characters are underdeveloped, and many of them meander without purpose through the plot.
