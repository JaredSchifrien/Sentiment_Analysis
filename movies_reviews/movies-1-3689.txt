There are several movies I am sorry ever got made, and this is one of them. I am so sorry I wasted my hard earned cash on such a rotten movie. But one could one expect from anything starring one of the worst actors ever to disgrace the screen, KELSEY GRAMMER? Even Robert De Niro, whose mere presense usually says GOOD MOVIE, couldn't help this trash. Dumb plot, dumb movie.
