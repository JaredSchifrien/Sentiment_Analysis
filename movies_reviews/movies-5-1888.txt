I really thought that Face/Off was a great action film and I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. I enjoyed all the action scenes- they all kept me on the edge of my seat, espescially the ending scene. I also thought the acting was great, as is to be expected by such fine actors as John Travolta and Nicholas Cage. I really think that Travolta did a fine job transforming into villian in this film. I also enjoyed the movie's attempt at integrating drama as well. In short, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Sure the plot was a bit far-fetched, but it was indeed unique and it had me on the edge of my seat.
