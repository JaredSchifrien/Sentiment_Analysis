 Jaws is certainly one of the most heart-pounding motion pictures ever made. It introduced to the world the superb talents of director, Steven Spielberg and musician, John Williams, two men who have defined the cinema of today. Immensely entertaining and highly suspenseful, Jaws is to Spielberg what Psycho is to Alfred Hitchcock.
