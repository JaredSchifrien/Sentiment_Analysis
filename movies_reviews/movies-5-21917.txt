Terminator 2 was one of the only few movies that was actually better than the original. This movie had it all- great acting, great directing, awesome special effects and great music. Terminator 2 redefined the movie industry with its special effects. Robert Patrick's portrayal of the evil T-1000 was excellent, and I was very happy to see the Terminator as a good guy rather than a bad guy. The film itself causes you to have an emotional connection to the machine, which makes the ending all the more depressing. A great movie- a classic!
