With an all-star cast, this film definately delivered. I always enjoy watching this film- a great mix of action and coemdy. Tom Arnold and Arnold Schwarzenneger had a very unique chemistry, and I thought that Tom Arnold did a wonderful job as the wisecracking annoying sidekick. I espescially like his line at the end: I'm sick of sitting in the van.... . Jamie Lee Curtis also gave a great performance as Schwarzenegger's clueless, naiive, shy wife. I love the way she makes the transition from good little housewife to bad girl in her notorious dance scene. That scene was both hilarious and sexy. I reccomend this film to anyone who is a fan of Jamie Lee Curtis or Schwarzenneger, or if you're just looking for a funny as hell action flick.
