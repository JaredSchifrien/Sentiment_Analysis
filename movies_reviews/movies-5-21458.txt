I saw this as an adult when it first came out and have watched it many times since. The story and characters still grip me, even knowing where the plot leads, and I'm still on the edge of my seat for the final flight scenes. Everything, from the casting to the soundtrack and the then-revolutionary special effects, makes it a great movie!
