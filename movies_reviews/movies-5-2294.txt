I think I would consider this more of a comedy than an Action/Thriller movie, but either way, it was great. It was Eddie Murphy's first movie role and kicked off as good of a start to a career as anyone has had (after 48 Hrs. there was Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop). Murphy and Nick Nolte were an excellent team. Unfortunately, they decided to get back together for Another 48 Hrs which was awful.
