This is probably one of the best French movies done in a long time. It's about this impish-looking little waitress who does something very kind for someone and then is infected by the feeling and decides to do more good thing for others. She also seeks the love of some stranger, and that sublot is creatively woven into the fabric of the movie and equally entertaining. It's funny and comforts the soul.
