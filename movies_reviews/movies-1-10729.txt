Of all the comments made about violence in the movies today Nurse Betty has one of the most violent (and unnessacary) scenes I have ever witnessed. It was so bad that it totally ruined the rest of the movie.This is NO COMEDY!!! That aside Nurse Betty quicky put me to sleep for the rest of the movie. To bad, this should have been a great movie. It has a lot of fine actors (I love Morgan Freeman) and what should have been a very good story. However, one scene, one little moment,ruines the experience.
