This is, without question, Nicholas Cage's best movie. I'm normally not a big fan of Holly Hunter, but even she turned in a great performance. And John Goodman was perfect as Cage's delinquent friend. Raising Arizona ranks right up there with Fargo as one of the Coen Brothers' best efforts. And, like the rest of the Coen's movies, it takes a slightly warped sense of humor to fully appreciate Raising Arizona. The scene where Cage robs a convenience store and has trouble getting away with the Pampers still makes me laugh.
