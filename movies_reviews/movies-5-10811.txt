really only supremely funny for those people who have seen all of Smith's movies. The funny asides and cameos make more sense. However, this movie is still full of funny moments, even if the plot is so-so. This is the type of movie where you see something new every time you see it. Plus, Ben Affleck is in this movie, and he was the *BOMB* in phantoms, yo! ;)
