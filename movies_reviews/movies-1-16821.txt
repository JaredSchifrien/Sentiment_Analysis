A movie about a pornographer? I THINK NOT! Hustler, the supertrash magazine that this fool created is disguistingly sick, as it was the first to show full nudity. The movie makes this nut out to be a hero when he should be locked up and focus on someone else. He has an open marriage, with sex before he was married, of course. Avoid this R-rated terror at all costs and watch any of the Trek or Star Wars movies or To Kill a Mockingbird for a good dramatic movie. Here's hoping pornograhpy becomes illegal soon...
