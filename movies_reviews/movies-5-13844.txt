 Fried Green Tomatoes, the quintessential chick flick, is a fantastic movie. The show alternates between two stories of women's friendship- one taking place in the present and the other set 50 years earlier in the small southern town of Whistle Stop. Kathy Bates (as a dowdy, unenlightened housewife) and Jessica Tandy (playing an octogenarian living in a nursing home) are a great pair, and they deserve credit for most of the movie's humor. The more serious side is shown through the relationship between Idgie (Mary Stuart Masterson) and Ruth (Mary-Louise Parker) who deal with a string of serious problems at a time when women didn't have many options. The acting is outstanding across the board, and the two storylines are engrossing. Even if you aren't a chick, I recommend checking out this movie.
