 When Harry Met Sally... is the perfect romantic comedy. Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal are terrific in their roles, and the supporting cast members (Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher) add a lot to the show. Surprisingly enough, the movie isn't too sappy and sentimental. Even my husband (who's quick to use the term chick flick ) likes this one. There are lots of great scenes- like the car ride to New York, the meal in the diner where Meg Ryan really enjoys her food, and the New Year's Eve parties. I also love the scenes of New York, especially the ones in Central Park, because they make the city look so attractive. Since everything about this movie is entertaining, I usually end up watching it once a year.
