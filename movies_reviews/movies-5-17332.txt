One of the best movies I have ever seen. Beautiful to watch. Humorous details throughout. Yet has a serious story -- the search for one's life meaning -- told metaphorically and directly, with humor, pathos, even an element of suspense/mystery. All the characters are well-developed and fun. Different story lines to keep one engaged. I highly recommend this uplifting movie. When I saw it in the theater the whole place was laughing, often. (Warning: this is an adult movies and is in French)
