An exceptional movie. After all of the lukewarm comments on this page, I didn't have very high expectations for this film. What Cast Away delivered was a phenomenal performance by Tom Hanks, a couple of chilling action scenes, and a very un-Hollywood ending. The storyline of a man stripped of everything but his survival instincts pitted against the awesome and unpredictable power of nature is a powerful one. If you haven't gotten around to seeing this movie because of all the hype / mixed press it received, you should wait no longer - Cast Away is a real winner.
