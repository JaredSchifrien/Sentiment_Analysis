Now this boys and girls... is horror done right. Not only one of the coolest ideas ever (beat Blair witch to the whole fake true story deal by over a decade) it also presents us with a more realistic horror monster...THE RED NECK. You watch this film and tell me you wouldn't be scared poo less if your friends were all being served to you while you are bound at the dinner table in a nasty house that has to smell like sh*t and be approached and taunted by a group of back woods hillbilly cannibals. Would it not scare you to be chased through unfamiliar forrests by a maniac weilding a chainsaw and wearing a mask made of human skin? There is no suspense just pure shock and terror. You see the horror through the eyes of the victims as well as the eyes of the psychos. Tobe Hooper did a great job with this picture. You can almost taste the putrid air of the Leatherface clan's house. You can almost feel the hammer comeing down on the top of your head. It did for meat eating what Psycho did for shower taking. A great classic shoker. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. A hell of a treat.
