Many of my friends had talked about how great this movie was for a long time. So, about a year ago, I finally rented it and was really pissed that it had taken me so long to see it. It is definitely one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. One of the more amazing aspects about the movie is that, for the most part, it wasn't scripted. So deep in their characters, the actors came up with many of the lines on the spot. Rob Reiner is great as the documentary film maker who follows around and interviews the band. And, the three bandmates are tremendous. This is Spinal Tap is a true original.
