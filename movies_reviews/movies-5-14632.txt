simply amazing..best movie i saw last year by far..i thought the three main characters were so different and so complex..was really good fun watching it..had its own nice pace..wasnt hurried at all..beautifully made..i especially liked kevin bacon..he put up a very strong performance..all together..controversies aside..sean penn deserved best actor..i thot clint eastwood shouldve won too..beautiful story..
