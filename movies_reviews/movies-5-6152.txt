'Patton' is one of the great movies of all-time, and one of the most parodied solely for the flag speech sequence at the beginning. But in essence, the casting and the acting are both superb. The storyline is fantastic as well. George C. Scott as the great-but-controversial General George S. Patton and Karl Malden as General Omar Bradley are the ego and conscience of the movie, respectively. Finally, with the great visuals, it isn't too hard to see why this movie is on AFI's 100 greatest movies ever. It deserves to be.
