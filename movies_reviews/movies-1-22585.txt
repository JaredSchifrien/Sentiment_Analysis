I really wasn't impressed with this.. Ok, fantastically done action scenes with amazing special effects. And that is it really. You can tell this film is centered around Arnie and it really doesn't pay off. The script was bitty and this film was no-where near as thought provoking as the previous two. A massive disappointment.
