No other film plays irony better than this one. The scene where Marty's mom kisses him near the end made me shriek with laughter. Not enough can be said about just how funny this film is. The scene where marty dresses like and alien and tells George he is Darth Vader from the planet... Vulcan with the hand gesture thrown in for emphasis, then threatens to melt his mind with Van Halen if he doesn't ask Loraine to the dance is pure gold.
