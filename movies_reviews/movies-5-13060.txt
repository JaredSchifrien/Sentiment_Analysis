Possibly the greatest film of all time, wonderfully written script that allows the viewer to see inside the heads of most family members, except the Don, played by Marlon Brando, who has an aire of mystery to him that isn't revealed until the Godfather Part II. The acting is superb on all levels, and the casting was done perfectly. Obviously modeled after Mario Puzo's novel, THE GODFATHER, but also contains elements of Milton's PARADISE LOST. The Don portrays a devil figure, cast out of his origanal home and achieves success in his new dwelling, also in that he is the head of an organization of men that he manipulates with ease. The Corleone Family is structured similar to that of the Army of Demons in PARADISE LOST as well. Being, without any argument, the best Mafia movie ever, The Godfather appeals to human interest in organized crime and violence. But the film is more than that, it provides a look into the American Dream of achieving success in the new world, by any means possible.
