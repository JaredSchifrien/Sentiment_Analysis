I AM NOT THE BIGGEST FAN OF ROMANTIC COMEDIES BUT PRETTY WOMAN IS QUITE SIMPLY WONDERFULL. IT HAS A TERRIFIC CAST( RICHARD GERE AND JULIA ROBERTS ARE A ACTING TEAM MADE IN HEAVEN), A GREAT SCRIPT,BRILLIANT DIRECTION FROM GARRY MARSHALL AND ONE OF THE BEST FINALES EVER TO ANY MOVIE EVER..... I LOVE THIS FILM TO BITS....
