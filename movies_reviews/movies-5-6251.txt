DeMille's last film and he pulled out all the stops. Moses turned his back on a privileged life to lead his people out of Egypt. It has an exceptional cast and the parting of the Red Sea rivals any modern special effects. Especially loved Charlton Heston and Anne Baxter. Oh Moses, Moses, you stubborn, splendid, adorable fool!
