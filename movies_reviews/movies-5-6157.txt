Although it now appears slightly dated, From Here to Eternity broke new ground with its critical evocation of military life and then daring romantic sequences (although the famous beach love scene between Lancaster and Kerr now seems rather tame). Brilliant acting by all. I actually find Burt Lancaster dominates the whole cast with his powerful presence - his strong performance was rewarded with a New York Film Circle award and an oscar nomination, although Clift is excellent as well.
