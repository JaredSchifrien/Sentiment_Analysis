Massive disapointment. I am a huge fan of James Patterson the author of all the Alex Cross detective novels and I must say in respect to the novel, this film is a travesty. This film is nothing like the biik which, in retrospect, is much more enjoyable and well thought out. This movie follows the book in no way except that the good guy is Alex Cross and the bad guy is Gary Sonja. This film grows into nothing. You end up feeling nothing for any character at all. And when ah ha moments fail to make you go ah ha. That is a sighn of failure. Kiss the Girls wasn't much better in that respect. Anyway, I recommend reading the books. Stay away from this film or any other film made of this brilliant series of books.
