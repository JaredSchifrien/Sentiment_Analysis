Though it is getting damned with faint praise by the critics, I find (as a Potter non-reader) that the Potter stories get increasingly more compelling to the adult viewer. Goblet of Fire was an interesting and exciting movie. I liked seeing that while Harry can go toe-to-toe with the fiercest dragons and the evilest of Dark Lords, he can't get laid. You'd think he can just wiggle [both] his magic wands at the delightfully witchy and firm buttocks of Hermoine Granger and her Hogwarts' skirt would magically go up and her little black witch thong would go down. At last I get to see the bad-assed dude named Voldermort. As with most horror movies (except for Alien), what you imagine is far scarier than what you see on screen. Voldermort looked something like the lovechild of Nosferatu and the Creature from the Black lagoon. And if he's so damned evil, how could he let little Potter essentially kick the shiite out of him in a battle to the death. It would be like one of the Olsen Twins knocking out Mike Tyson. Of course, it's only a movie. The big issue is that this PG-13 is for real. Some stupid Daddio behind me took his six-year kid to watch th movie. Every 10 minutes, stupid Daddio is reassuring his kid, "It's not that scary, right?" Near the end of the movie, the 6-year old sounds like he's peed his pants in terror and is moaning at images of skeletons and blood and death. Idiot Daddio is going, "It's okay...you'll be alright." Li'l Dude is probably not going to be able to sleep for the next 10 years.
