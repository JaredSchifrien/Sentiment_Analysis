A 3.5 hour waste of time... very disappointing! Though the cast is wonderful and the acting is awesome the storyline rotted. I watched waiting for the lives to entwine or coincidence (as portrayed in the beginning) to occur and was left empty with too distant connections. Alot of off the wall incidences that spoiled what you would view as a serious movie - each character singing the same song and a frog shower... pooh. Good music throughout but I could buy the soundtrack for that - without wasting so much time!
