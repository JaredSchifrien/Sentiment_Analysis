M. Night Shymalayan is so far-and-away the best moviemaker of our era, it's not even funny. This is an A+ movie just like Sixth Sense was (Unbreakable was perhaps an A-). As usual, his script is fantastic and unpredictable, and he takes the old Hitchcock-style tricks of suspense better than anyone. From he opening credits, he gets you off-balance with the stress-inducing socore. Ominous signs keep you on edge... but then moments of humor settle your nerves, get you involved with the characters, before he ratchets it up another notch. The whole thing is superb. A movie that's fun to think about from at least three different angles, and FUN to watch at the same time. How many films can you say that about?
