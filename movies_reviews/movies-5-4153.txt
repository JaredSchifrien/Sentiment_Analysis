Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is one of my all-time favorite movies. Roald Dahl was a genius when it came to understanding children, and this movie is the ideal combination of magic, mystery, adventure, and fun. Gene Wilder was magnificent as the eccentric Mr. Wonka, and the children who accompanied Charlie into the factory were an absolute riot. I'll never forget the scene where Augustus Gloop falls into the chocolate river and is sucked up into a pipe or the one where Violet Beauregarde turns into a giant blueberry and is rolled off to be de-juiced. In many ways, this movie is very scary for children, but that's part of what makes it so much fun. I make it a point to see this movie at least once a year.
