After just reading the book, I thought the movie deleted too many essential characters and left out too many important facts that would have explained things in the movie. The movie seemed out of kelter with the book in several spots, almost as if they had to put them in the movie but not in the order they were in the book. Overall, the movie just plain sucked. The actress that played Clarice Starling was horrible. I think if Joddie Foster had played in it, her abilities would have been so much better. The entire movie seemed like a clinical manual void of the emotion and horror that fuled the first movie.
