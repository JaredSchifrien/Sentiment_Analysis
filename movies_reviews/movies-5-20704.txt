 The Sound of Music is a movie that tells the story of the Von Trapp family. It is so interesting because it is set in the time of WWII and the Nazi regime in Europe. Through beautiful music and the events that occur to Maria and the Von Trapp family, we see the sadness of their situation in Austria. So many people being forced to fight a war they did not agree with.
