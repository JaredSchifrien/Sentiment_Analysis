Great fantasy story! There are very few fantasies out there that come close to the sense of awe and wonder this film projects. E.T. is the only one that comes to mind. Add that to the fact that it is has been branded onto our culture in the same vein as films like Gone With the Wind, Casablanca, Psycho and others. Great performances, excellent visuals, interesting situations and some great songs! It all adds up to one great film!
