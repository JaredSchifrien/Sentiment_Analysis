This movie is, dare I say, brilliant. Bitingly funny and alot of black humor at that. This film is ludicrous and completley off in a universe all it's own. Tim Burton added nothing but genious to this film. You cannot help but laugh from beginning to end. Yet another film that helped shape me into the weirdo that I am today. Don't hate this film because Paul Reubins is in it and he was busted for churning the butter in an adult movie theater. Paul is one hell of a funny guy. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! When you get there tell em Large Marge sent ya!
