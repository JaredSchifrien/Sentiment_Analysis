I know the movie isnt great art, but I LIKED it a lot. But maybe thats cause cars street racing has been a part of most of my life. The cars used were awsome. Most of my friends people I talk to about it say it sucked Im sure a lot of other people would agree, but its one of my favorite movies. It was exciting I loved the racing scenes. Also, Paul Walker Vin Deisel are two of my favorite actors. They are also hott!! But I think the movie was really good!!
