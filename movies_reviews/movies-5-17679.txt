A barge captain and dreamily romantic young bride travel the Seine and Parisian waterways,in the company of numerous cats and a memorably eccentric first mate with a hoard of unusual bric-a-brac. A warm,leisurely,lyrical and gently anarchic adventure,infused with a poetic sense of wonderment,Jean Vigo's only feature film(before his death at 28)has been voted one of the world's top 10 in numerous polls.A precious pearl,to be discovered and cherished.
