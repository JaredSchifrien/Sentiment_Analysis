I gave this movie a 5 because I love Pink Floyd. Truth to tell, I will never ever watch this movie again. It's absolutely miserable. The animation sequences are billiant and disturbing. The structure of the movie is quite...unique. When I saw it, I left feeling confused and suicidal. According to my best friend, that qualifies an effective work of art. And yes, it is very effective. The music is amazing and makes it all worth it.
