Toy Story was a creative masterpiece. It is a true achievement when adults and children can see a movie and enjoy it equally. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were wonderful providing the voices for the main characters. It was also good to see many of the toys of my youth (i.e. Mr Potato Head) come to life on the screen. If you have or don't have kids, check this movie out. It is funny and touching and you won't be disappointed.
