The Rocky series are my favourite films ever for so many reasons, the acting, the fighting and everything else is all brill! The Rocky series also brought hope to the little guy in which they never get a chance (or in Rockys case never got a shot at a decent title) My favourite line of the whole film has to be in RockyIV where Apollo(just b4 his fight)says i feel like i could eat nails, Stallion! Rocky replies I'v seen them snails in the garden but i'v never wanted to eat them Every time i see that clip i always laugh. After watching every film roughly 30times i still dont know my favourite. Thats how good these films are.I heard a rumour that a RockyVI is on the cards in which Rocky steps back into the ring 1 more time but we all no when Rocky says just one more fight he really means just another 20.Hope the rumour is true.ROCKY! ROCKY! ROCKY! ROCKY!
