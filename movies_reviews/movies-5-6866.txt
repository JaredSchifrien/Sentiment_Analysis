You really cannot beat the Monty Python lot, Holy Grail is one of my favourite films. Especially with the knights who say 'nee' and demand a shrubbery (then changed it to eckky, eckky, eckky, zuboing....), also with the French saying 'your mother was a pig and your father smelled of elderberries'. Its a fantastic film and full of the dry wit us British are proud to have.
