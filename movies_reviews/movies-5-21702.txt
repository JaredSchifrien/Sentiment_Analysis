No words. I can't describe it. Wait, yes I can... The acting was incredible, but far surpassing even the charms of Orlando Bloom is the majesty of the special effects. The editing is seamless and absolutely astounding. The entire trilogy is breathtaking, but this one takes the cake. The first 4 times that I saw it, I bawled. Yeah, I'm a fan.
