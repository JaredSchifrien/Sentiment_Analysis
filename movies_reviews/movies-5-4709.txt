It's a beautiful movie -- probably not my favourite of the early Disney movies, but near the top of the list. The evil queen is one of Disney's best villains. The more recent Disney creations, churned out at the rate of a couple per year, can't even come close to the beauty and magic of the older ones. Children today are being shortchanged.
