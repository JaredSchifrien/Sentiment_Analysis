Very Funny Holiday Fare. Will be a XMAS Classic 50 years from now. I like just about everything Will Ferrel has done, and I think he does a great job here. The movie keeps the laughs plentiful and hearty. Much funnier than either Santa Clauses. The DVD has some excellent Bonus Features, particularly the games.
