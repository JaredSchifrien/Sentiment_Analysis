IF I could give it 6 stars instead I would. I have never seen a movie that wrenched at your heart like DITD. The story, the actors the music the visuals all come together in a strange odd way that wring out every known emotion from your body and leave you feeling all sorts of conflicted emotions when you leave the theatre. For someone who is not an actress Bjork was superb as Selma, the poor factory worker who is going blind and trying to save money for an operation for her son. The movie really made me think as a mother of a boy myself. Would I have done the same things if I were in her shoes. It really made me examine myself as a person. How far does the love of your child go? How far should a mother go? I cant say what I would do. And that is a chilling thought. David Morse was incredible. I found myself hating him with a passion yet feeling so bad for him at the same time. The rest of the cast were equally incredible. The whole film is so devestating so surreal so awful and yet uplifting. There were funny parts. And many parts that made you choke back tears. And many scenes that left you with tears streaming down your face and shaking your head. Its my all time favorite film EVER. I dont think I will ever see anything as close to perfection in a film as was DITD
