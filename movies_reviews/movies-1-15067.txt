Any one who believes there was a conspiracy should read Posner's Cose Closed. Anyone with a modicum of critical thinking and common sense who looks at the raw data of the assassination would come to the logical conclusion that Oswald was the line gunman. Anti-Castro Cubans, Pro-Castro Cubans, the Military, the CIA, FBI, Dallas Police, the mob, LBJ, Secret Service ..... yeh they were all involved. Oh what about aliens, I guess Oliver Stone did not have enough time to include them. Remember Occumm's Razor - all things considered equal, the simplist explanation is usually correct. Oswald did it - get over it!!
