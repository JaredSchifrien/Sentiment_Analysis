The movie that proves Jim Carrey actually has acting talent. I love the basic plot of the movie which explored the idea of reality TV before the actual fad hit the airwaves in the form of Survivor and Big Brother. If you want a comedy then this isn't for you, but if you're looking for a well written, well acted movie that explores a somewhat controversial issue, then this is your movie.
