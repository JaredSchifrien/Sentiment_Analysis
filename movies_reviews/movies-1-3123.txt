Dull, boring, uninteresting, uninspired, unorigional, complete BS. Take your pick they're all true. I got bored with this movie after nazis with knives started jumping out of every corner one at a time only to get shot in the head. I was waiting for that tired old cliche` where a black cat would jump out hissing. If you want a good World War 2 film try Saving Private Ryan or one of many other films about W.W.2.
