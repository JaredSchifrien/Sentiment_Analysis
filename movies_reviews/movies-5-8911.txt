Very flamboyant, and very unlike the real world that most gay people live in. However, Robin Williams and Nathan Lane did such outstanding jobs in their characters that it made the movie one of the best comedies of that year. I almost fell out of my seat at the movie theatre everytime Nathan Lane hit the screen as Albert...he was so hilarious and you couldn't help but like his character in the movie no matter how whiny and extremely dramatic he got. I even enjoyed Gene Hackman as the conservative father. This movie will be a classic someday. A must have for die-hard Robin Williams fans. On a final note- it was nice seeing a gay couple portrayed as life long partners who love each other no matter how bad it gets...EXCELLENT MOVIE !!!
