This movie was horrible. It was not funny at all. Everyone that I've ever talked to also say it was horrible. his is one of Sandra Bullock's worst performanes. I think she was on her last two legs with this movie, and they just got cut off. A real sleeper. Expect anything but entertainment from this horrid film
