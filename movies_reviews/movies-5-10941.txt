You'd think that this movie was all sex if you saw the trailer for it, which is why I went to see it, but it suprised me on a few levels. 1. The movie has a decent plot. It's a typical boy-likes-girl-then-girl-hates-boy-then-they-like-each-other-and-have-sex film, but it had a plot too. 2. The acting was o.k. You'd think it'd be bad, but it wasn't. Other than that, this movie is worth renting.
