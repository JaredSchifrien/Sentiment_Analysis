One of Stephen King's best translations to screen ever. I don't generally care for his movies, especially the miniseries. However, this is a true gem. Kathy Bates is terrifyingly real in her portrayal of a psychopath, and Kahn excellently portrays the emotions of a man caught in a helpless and evidently hopeless situation. This movie doesn't contain large amounts of blood or gore, but has a very realistic and believable quality. It definitely makes my A list.
