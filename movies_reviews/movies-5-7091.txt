This may be my favorite Mel Brooks movie. I love the whole classic horror movie feel that we get from it being filmed in black and white. I also enjoy seeing Marty Feldman in one of his best performances. Sight gags abound, and in the sceen where the doctor brings the monster to life they used many of the electrical props from the original Frankenstein movie. This movie features a great cast and is worth buying for your home collection.
