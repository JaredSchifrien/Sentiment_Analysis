I do adore Stanley Kubrick films and its a shame he's no longer with us. I found this film very disturbing in places and then a bit lighthearted. It does make you think about the atrocities of war and it shows what happened in Vietnam. Vietnam films are always the most realistic as it was the first media war, the general public of America actually saw what happened, and the veterans protested. It was an absolutely disgusting war and a lot of young innocent men paid for it with their lives.
