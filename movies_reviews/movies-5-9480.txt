This is the movie about males and relationships. Surprisingly males actually have feelings. The movie is a great commentary on the male perspective of the relationship, focusing on how one man handles a break up with a long time girlfriend. The movie is also for music lovers, and by music lovers. I mean, obssesive music collectors who really know their stuff. The movie is also a stunningly well done adaptation of the book. The screen writers successfully change the narrative from english slang (British) to American. A fine movie.
