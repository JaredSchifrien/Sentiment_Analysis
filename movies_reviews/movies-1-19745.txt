I saw this movie because everyone told me the opening scene was so awesome. When I watched it I laughed. It might have been cool, if it weren't so cheap and campy looking. For me that pretty much set the mood for the entire film. Not only was I not scared through any of it. I found myself laughing through most of it. Bad script, bad acting, and baaaaaaaaad special effects.
