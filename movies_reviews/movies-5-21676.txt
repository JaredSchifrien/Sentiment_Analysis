My favorite movie of all time, bar-none. I love the Trilogy, and this film, in my opinion, is the greatest. The whole Jabba's palace scene, the battle on Endor, the huge space battle, and the climactic scene in the Emperor's throne room - this movie has it all. The trilogy concludes itself well in this fantastic film, proving to be a tale of the power of good, and, ultimately, redemption.
