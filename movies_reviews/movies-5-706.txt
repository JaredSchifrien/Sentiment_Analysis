This is one fantastic movie. Harrison Ford is the likable doctor who you of course want to believe. Tommy Lee Jones is the 'bad guy' U.S. Marshall who is actually just doing his job. The plot rocks, the action is taut, the acting is perfect. This is also one of those 'rated' movies the kids could watc. It has no sexual content, mild violence, and a medium amount of language. Go rent it tonight.
