Finally a movie that at least somewhat explains why the Scot's, and the Irish resent the British rule so much.Great battle scenes! Lot's of blood and gore, an awesome plot, and storyline.One of the few movies that can combine a love story, historical millitary fiction, and massive amounts of violence and not come off cheesey.
