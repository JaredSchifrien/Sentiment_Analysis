Kevin Smith's first movie, budgeted partialy on his mother's credit card. It is filmed in black and white, almost giving you the feel that you are watching the characters on a survielance camera. The dialogue gets a little graphic at times, but so does real life. This movie, for anyone who has ever worked serving the public or ever plans to, is a must. I can relate to the scene where the chick is standing beside the big flashing neon sign with the price right in front of her eyes asking Dante How much?. People truly are that stupid. You get a good sense of realism from this movie. An only slightly skewed version of reality for real life clerks. I've been the one behind that counter. Trust me.
