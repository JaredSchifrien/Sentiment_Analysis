You won't be disappointed. In fact, I believe this movie far exceeded my expectations. A perfect ending to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Return of the King, excellent performances, almost-flawless CG, and breathless cinematography complement the epic story beautifully. Like the others, it's a long movie, so it probably wouldn't be a good idea to buy the super-mega-value-sized drink for this movie. (NOTE: The following may contain spoilers; if you don't wanna know, stop reading here.) The segment that showed the evolution of Smeagol/Gollum was a great introduction. Being as I didn't read the book, I particularly enjoyed Eowyn's role in this installment--after seeing the second movie, I didn't think she'd really come into play. The battles, though didn't quite compare to the second movie's, were absolutely great. It's difficult to find flaws in this movie. An absolute work of art. (Note: I didn't read the books yet, so I don't have any comparison between the novels and the movies. This review is based solely on the movie.)
