They did not follow the plot of the book, they did not have all the charracters from the book, where the hell was Mekare, the real Queen of the Damned? Jesse and Lestat did not, nor will they ever end up together. Where was Louie? He was supposed to be kissed by Lestat before Lestat ever went out on stage. Armand was not blonde, is not blonde, and never in his everlasting life will he ever BE blonde! He is russian, with long red-brown hair. Pandora never died, she still lives out her existance hating and loving what she is. Where as Lestat's mother, Gabriel? She should have at least had a MINOR part in the movie! This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen. Every copy should be burned.
