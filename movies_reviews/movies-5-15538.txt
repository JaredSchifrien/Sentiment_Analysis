The naysayers may think otherwise, but Titanic is one of the best movies of modern times and will go down in history as a genuine classic. I guarantee people will be watching and weeping over it 60 years from now, much like we do today with Gone With the Wind. Sure, the dialogue was somewhat corny, but you can't deny the heartfelt and realistic performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet- they had great chemistry as the leads and made us truly connect with their characters. The supporting actors were very good as well, and I liked how well the filmmakers matched the modern actors with the real historic figures from 1912 (Molly Brown, Capt. Smith, Bruce Ismay, etc.) After seeing Pearl Harbor, I've learned to appreciate how much better Titanic is; where Pearl failed, Titanic succeeded. It was successful because we really got to make an emotional investment in the characters, the ship, and the entire setting. Unlike Pearl, where you were praying for the bombing to begin, in Titanic you were just praying they would somehow miss the iceberg!! The sinking sequences and historic drama of what the people onboard went through are realistic and heart-wrenching; you truly feel the tragic impact- I remember sobbing uncontrolably the second time I saw Titanic and cried several other times in subsequent viewings. Call me a sap, but that's what a good movie is supposed to do to you- it takes you into the world of the characters and you feel the tragedy as much as they do. The musical score by James Horner is a classic and I love the Celtic flutes and whistles- they added an interesting touch to the soundtrack, and of course My Heart Will Go On is a beautiful song with a universal theme, not just related to the film. Gloria Stuart was robbed of an Oscar in her amazing performance as old Rose, but at least the film won the 11 other Oscars it deserved.
