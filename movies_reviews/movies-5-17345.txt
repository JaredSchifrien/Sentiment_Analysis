This is said to be the best French movie ever produced, and I don't doubt it a sec! It's fabulous! It gives you such a good feeling, although Amelie doesn't only do good things...but we forget it 'cause the other people (the ones she doesn't treat very well) are very bad people themselves. It's said that Amelie discribes a perfect society that doesn't exist anywhere and which wount be realized ever... I'm not so sure about that. What the film discribes is creativity and actions done by heart. I know this exist. I think the people commenting saying that Amelie is unrealistic, say so 'cause they feel themselves would never be able to live up to the ideals of the movie. But don't blame the audience for that. I know many people as good as Amelie in the movie. Take Gandhi as an example! I would like to recommend to the entire world to go to the nearest cinema and see this beautiful film! This movie is actually said to better than La vita e bella (Life is Beautiful), American Beauty and Psycho, and I can see why! It has become an integrated part of the French president eleccion campaign... It'll paralize me if it turns out that Amelie don't win the Oscar for best foreign movie this year! :-)
