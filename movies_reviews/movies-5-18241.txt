Sam Raimi stumped upon a simple formula of making an unneccessary gory horror movie and adding Bruce Campbell to it. This one gets a five because it was the first movie to really do the gory-horror-comedy formula. I couldn't stop laughing because you expect to be scared, but instead they treat you to gallons of blood and a zombie saying, I'll swallow your soul. It is just so unbelievable from start to fininsh.
