Oh.., come on people. People, people people. I know I'm gonna misspell their names, but this movie so out there, so weird, so messed up, that it's goooood. Mercedes McCambrige verus Joan Crawford. Ward Bond with his posse all dressed up in black preacher coats. Sterling Heydon as Johnny Guitar. I don't think he knew how to play one, but he has this little student guitar he carries around. And the Kid played by a guy with Brookyln accent, as did alot of actors in westerns, apparently the old west was full of them. Don't it take so seriously. This is a great movie.
