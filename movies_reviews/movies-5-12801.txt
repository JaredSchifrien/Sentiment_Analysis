I cited this movie in my rating of McDonald's food not too long ago, so my rant toward Mickey D's still stands. But, in reaction to this movie, every one should go see it. For their health. Not that I eat much fast food, but since I have seen this movie it is unlikely that I ever will again. I have even thought of buying a copy on dvd to control my late night binges. Trust me, this movie will make you feel like a fat american, even if you are not. Most of all, I was impressed with the amount of research that went into this movie. Its claims were grounded and arguments were well supported (though there was no main underlying statement such as DONT EAT FAST FOOD!). The best part about this movie is that it has sparked neccessary change. Since the movie was released McDonalds no loner offers Super Size Meals and I am noticing more and more articles focusing on an individual's portion size for a meal. I know that many of you refuse to give up that big mac and fries, but I still urge you to watch this movie, it really might change your mind.
