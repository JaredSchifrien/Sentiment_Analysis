damn it! I just cant understand why critics are so bent upon criticizing this movie and making it look like such a disaster (at least the more professional critics are doing so). To me, there is no better proof of how great this movie is than my fellow reviewers comments on the movie. Sure, the dialogue is not, how to put it, shakesperean. Some of it seems clunky. But, nonetheless, the movie is a breathtaking spectacle. I loved it. I was excited. I even cried during the ending. It even made me feel like a child again. Too bad Lucas wasted an entire movie and wasnt able to pace the dark side turn better. Mind you, episode I is still crap, but this is as good as it gets. And, most of all, I dont understand what critics say about haydens portrayal. I absolutely bought it. It is a great, great, great movie.
