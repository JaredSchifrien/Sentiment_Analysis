Say what you will about this movie, you still have to admit - it certainly caused a lot of people to think. Maybe that was Gibson's idea in the first place. All I know is the way I felt when I left this film transcended any of the dogma or doctrine human beings have dreamed up over the centuries to embellish what happened that day 2,000 years ago. All the yapping voices of priests, popes, preachers, scholars and self-satisfied experts were silenced and all I saw was Christs suffering and sacrifice illustrated in a way I had never really fully considered. I couldn't have cared less if the film's outline followed the Stations of the Cross or a Baptist Passion play. I wasn't offended that Mary cradled her son's broken dead body in her arms reminiscent of the Pieta. I wasnt shocked that Christ had a good relationship with his friends and family or that he loved his mother. I do not for one minute believe that the violent nature of the film was gratuitous and was there only to bring in more cash. No, there were no real feel good fuzzy moments in this film. It wasnt about that it was about the reality of death by crucifixion and a suffering messiah who was willing to go through that kind of torture for us. If you thought it was about anything else then Im pretty sure you missed the point. (Oh, and by the way, if you haven't seen the movie do your personal credibility a big favor and don't review it until you have.)
