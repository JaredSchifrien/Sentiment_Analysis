This film was sad and very disturbing at times, but it was brilliant. Many times in films when they portray a serial killer you either hate them, sympathise with them or you simply don't get them. You absolutely cannot condone ruthless murders, but in Monster you gain an understanding of one woman's tactic for survival, a clear understanding of why she did what she did and most of all her universal search to be loved and accepted. Christina Ricci underplayed the character of Selby nicely and Charlize prooved that shes not just a pretty face by not only physically transforming herself, but mentally too. For the first time in a long time I can honestly say that someone rightfully deserved the Best Actress Oscar gong this year.
