This is one great and scary movie. Anthony Hopkins is perfect as Hannibal Lector and Jodie Foster is almost his equal as the FBI agent. There are some great twists and the dialogue will keep you on the edge of your seat right until the end. Lector is the obvious bad guy, the embodiment of evil, but you find yourself mesmerized by him and rooting for him. This is not your slasher-type horror movie, but an incredibly suspenseful, brilliantly written thriller.
