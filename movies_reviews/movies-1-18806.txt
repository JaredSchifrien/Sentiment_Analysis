I hated the f***ing thing! It was so darn scary! It got me so jumpy that it wasn't even funny! The ending was the worst I have seen in years. What is it with modern horror movies and bad endings? First jeepers creepers and now this! Why did they have to kill the guy? He was the only cool guy in the movie. That's totally not how I would end a movie. And I just wanna say that the part of the reason why the movie scared me so f***ing much is that it was so nasty! I mean the dead bodies didn't have to be so ugly... And BIGBABY is right, too many unanswered questions. I think the horrors should be scary while you watch them and the ending is supposed to rid the viewer of all fear, because everything is supposed to be explained. My butt! And considering that the movie was actually a rip-off of that other japanese movie, its identical copy one might say, the director has done a poor job. Message to the directors: please, don't make so f***ing scary senseless movies!
