I finally got to see this movie and I was thrilled! It was beautifully done and wickedly funny (even if it wasn't historically accurate but hey, that's Hollywood)! However, I would not recommend this movie to everyone...I would say if you have a closed mind, no sense of humor and are easily offended then don't see this movie. But if you like to be thrilled, shocked, amused and touched see it. It's not just a movie about sex...it's about sexual expression, sexual repression, censorship, hypocrisy, forbidden love...I could go on and on. Rush was amazing, Winslet was perfect...I would have given it more stars but they only allow me 5.
