Who keeps giving these movies 1's and 2's??? There are very few films that surpass SEVEN SAMURAI, in the entire history of filmmaking. It is surely Kurosawa's best (OK, so maybe not surely; RASHOMON is pretty spectacular as well), and it puts to shame the overhyped American classics like GONE WITH THE WIND and A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE. Watch it! And watch all the other great foreign movies! If you don't, you're missing out on a treasure trove of genius.
