my favorite movie of all time, pulp fiction is a masterpiece. i love everything about this film from the memorable characters with real personalities(samuel l jackson as the scripture quoting hitman), the humorous conversations (now look, maybe your method of massage differs from mine,but you know touching his wife's feet and sticking your tongue in the holiest of holies ain't the same f***ing ballpark. it ain't the same league. it ain't even the same f***ing sport.), and the excellent directing by quetin tarantino.
