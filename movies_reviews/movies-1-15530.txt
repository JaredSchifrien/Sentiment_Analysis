What a sad, useless thing was created here. The acting sucked. It was porrly directed. The woman had barely any boobs. This movie totally mocked the whole concept of a boat sinking. I saw it once and had to go home and watch forty-eight hours of Back To The Future, Indiana Jones, and Rocky to clear my mind of this crap.
