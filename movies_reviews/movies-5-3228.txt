Terribly underrated judging from its ranking on this list. Malice was a great thriller that included top actors at their very best. Baldwin and Kidman were especially good in their roles, as was Pullman. The plot is solid, and the film presents a very suspenseful aura that keeps hold of the viewer's attention throughout. Malice is a great suspenseful thriller that has a few twists and turns here and there and a high quality cast. Highly recommended to all.
