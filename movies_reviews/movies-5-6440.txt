The more time goes by, the better this movie seems. Although rooted in -- and inspired by -- the Cold War and McCarthyism, Robert Wise's neat, unpretentious tale is truly timeless. Fine performances by Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal, and Sam Jaffe-- plus Gort, one of the great robots in film history.
