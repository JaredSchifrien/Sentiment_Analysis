Man I cracked up in this. It was absolutely HILARIOUS! It was sometimes a bit stupid, like the whole pissing thing and the robot voice, but in the end, I thought it ws the funniest thing I'd ever seen, well, not really. It was still pretty damn funny though. Get it out and watch it. You'll be in hysterics. Austin Powers will become an icon for cinema. Mike Myers is brilliant. Summary: HILARIOUS, GREAT, MUST-SEE.
