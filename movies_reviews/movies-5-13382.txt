 Forrest Gump has always been one of my favorite movies, and I'm sure that 25 years from now, people will still be watching it, laughing and crying along with Forrest. I thought Tom Hanks was at his best here. His acting in this film, or any other for that matter, is so believable and intense. Never have so many subplots been fit into the big picture so perfectly. I really enjoyed seeing history through the eyes of a man who just sees things as they are and doesn't provide an opinionated slant one way or another. I thought that his analysis on JFK was simple and actually sort of funny in the way that he said it: Somebody shot that man while he riding in his car. His meeting with both JFK and LBJ was hilarious.... I got shot in the butt... . His love for Jenny makes for compelling drama, and his friendshp with Bubba (obsessed with shrimp) makes for some funny moments and some sad ones as well. He goes on to run across country, run a shrimp business, play football, and do anything imaginable despite having a low IQ. I loved how Forrest was so down to earth and nothing mattered to him but making those around him happy and honoring their memory when they died (Momma, Bubba and Jenny). A great performance by Sally Field as Forrest's Momma. Never before have I seen a movie that brought out all of the audience's emotions so well. This film is a classic!
