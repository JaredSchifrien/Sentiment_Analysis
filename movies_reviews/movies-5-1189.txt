Goldfinger (the third film in the James Bond film franchise released in 1964) marks the point where the series reaches cruising altitude and speed. All of the now expected elements are here: suave, lady-killer Bond (Sean Connery), Q's gadgets; Batmobilish automobile, tongue-in-cheek puns, and a killer theme song by Shirley Bassey. One also gets the feeling that Goldfinger (Gert Frobe) is every bit the equal of 007, though on the dark side. Goldfinger is the first in the series in which Bond has any real and extended interaction with his chief nemesis resulting in a richer film and better character development. The movie also introduces the exotic sidekick with Oddjob (which was revisited in The Man With The Golden Gun (1974)) and returns to using intriguing names for the primary Bond Girl in the form of Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore. The only real complaint with this film is the real time editing problem near the end of the movie when Bond is blindly trying to defuse a bomb as a nuclear scientist rushes down the steps to do it himself.
