I was not hoping to even see Doctor Zhivago . I thought it was some dark, dismal film but I was surprised at how quickly I got into the movie. It's such a wonderful story. I watched it in two viewings so it didn't come across as being long and tiresome for me. It's the story of a doctor (Omar Sharif) who falls in love during the Russian Revolution and it's truly captivating. Alec Guinness also makes a good appearance. Terrific movie.
