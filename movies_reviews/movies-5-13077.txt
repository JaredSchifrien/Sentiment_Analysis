Schindler's List was based on a true story. Obviously the people who belive that the halocaust did not happen will disagree with me.... Set that aside, this film is beautifully done - Steven Spielberg obviously did a lot of research into this as I don't think anything in this film is overdramatised at all. It is very disturbing seeing certain events in this film - but it only reflects how disturbing life can be. It was a story that needed to be done, this is something that we should not forget. Persecution of any manner is wrong.
