You are an alien race, Super Higly Intelligent, capable of space travel and plantetary domination. So WHY I ask would you travel to and try to dominate a world which is 75% water, which is something that is your biggest weakness. Just that alone kills all credibility of the plot and makes the movie terrible. Also, the whole divine intervention, man angry at God, etc just doesn't go with an alien invasion subplot. It was not the least bit scary...well I was scared that if I died on the way home, this movie would be the last thought on my mind. Perhaps I was expecting the same quality as in The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. I guess I was wrong. This director didn't even come close. There were so many little tangents he went out on and didn't even attempt to tie them together. The characters had no development and were inconistant. The wife could see things as she was gonna die, but couldn't see that she was gonna die. There was no surprise ending and the aliens looked like atheletes in body paint. Also, when the embattled earth was dealing with the invasion, which was killing thousands of people, why would the media wait until after the commercial to announce the primative miracle weapon ? Come on.
