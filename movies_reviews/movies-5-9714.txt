My girlfriend and I found this movie to be completely hysterical. We haven't laughed that much at a movie in a long time. We went in with medium expectations (Will Smith was in it, so it couldn't be all bad) and were pleasantly surprised. I think this movie works because it's a reflection of how most people really feel about the dating scene. I particularly thought the last half-hour or so was great, when you see how difficult it is for him to talk to the woman he loves. I HIGHLY recommend this film!!!
