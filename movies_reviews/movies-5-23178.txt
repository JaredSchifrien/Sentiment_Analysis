Listen people, you have to see this movie. Not only is it the most creative movie that i have seen in years, it really affected me as a person as well. It is sad, but beautiful in a way that will make you really question what you would be willing to sacrifice for someone you love. If you love sci-fi, horror, love stories, and just really good movies in general, i highly recommend that you see Donnie Darko. I promise you that it will not disappoint.
