This movie is one of the most powerful, most moving films ever made. The fact that it was real, that it really happened to Americans is truly heartbreaking. I can't imagine the horror they went through. The movie is *very* graphic in parts. Just thinking about that guy that loses the entire bottom half of his body, the one who loses his thumb, or the guy that picked up the hand and stuck it in his pocket. . .it gives me chills and makes my stomach turn. I think the actors all worked well together. The ending could have been a bit better -- it kind of leaves you hanging and fills you in on what happened through text. I would have liked to see when Mike was set free from his imprisonment by the militia. It would have made a very powerful, tear-jerker ending.
