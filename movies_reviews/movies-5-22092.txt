Without a doubt the best action flick ever made. It still impresses me to watch the fight scenes in this one. The second and third installments have nothing on this one. This film seems much more singular and focused than its sequels. The use of bullet time photography has been endlessly parodied and the characters have been duplicated time and again. This is the action movie that every other action movie wishes it could be.
