I love this movie, naoi2753om I should swallow your soul! Silent Bob(Kevin Smith) Almost has a god! rateing with me. This movie is among my top ten. Kevin Smith Picked a target that was well worth it. Alanis Morrisette is the best reprensentation of God that i have seen to this date. The Ill Equipped angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) Gave a great preformance. (labr8631om Bob spoke twice No Ticket thanks On the train and and at the end of the movie to god) please people do your homework But I do Belive in this -Matt Damon
