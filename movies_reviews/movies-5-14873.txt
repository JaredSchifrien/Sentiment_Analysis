What a great movie! I thought Sissy Spacek and Hugh Wilkinson should have gotten Best Actress and Best Actor Oscars respectively, but of course the people I like never win. Hugh Wilkinson does a particlularly understated and masterful job as Sissy Spacek's husband, and film buffs might be interested to know that this amazing actor actually hails from Yorkshire, England and was in the hugely funny Full Monty. He's anything but funny in this heart-wrenching drama about a family that is devastated by the son's affair with an older woman and the catastrophic results. Sissy Spacek deserves kudos as the normally strong mother who simply cannot deal with the death of her son. This movie makes some sharp comments about America's justice system, too. Their son's murderer gets off lightly and Sissy Spacek has to endure the agony of running into him at the local grocery store. The murderer can only manage a feeble hi. Sissy Spacek's and Hugh Wilkinson's solution to this dilemma is shocking and unconventional, but one can certainly understand it. However, this movie will definitely not leave you smiling from ear to ear. Rent it if you're depressed and in the mood for a good cry.
