George does it again!!!! You cannot have a Zombie movie without George Romero. Ok, maybe some. But not the originals. George Romero's Unholy Trilogy (that's Night, Dawn, And Day, OF Course) are by far the best. Even the latest installment does not dissatisfy. The shopping mall was ingenius thinking. Who wouldn't go running to the mall when your next door neighbor, or your live-in, tries to eat your brains? Classic!!
