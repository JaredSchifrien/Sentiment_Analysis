John Carpenter is truly one of the kings of horror!!! Roddy Piper has long been one of my favorite wrestlers. The chance to see him act could not be passed up. This movie might not be up to some peoples high standards, but to me, you rate a movie on the story, the acting, and the over all presentation. This movie has one of my all time favorite lines from any movie. I came here to kick ass and chew bubble gum....and i'm all out of bubble gum!!! Hell yeah! Kick ass, Roddy!
