Totally moving and funny. It's great to get in touch with old school times while watching this. UPDATE: I don't want to trash talk D J, but you haven't seen closely the asthetics of this movie. I'm a fan of Fat Al in general and I loved the show since I had cable and it was on the USA network in the 1980's. Any fan of him and Bill Cosby will somehow want to see a movie based on his shows.
