I was completely blown away by this beautiful and brilliant film. Certainly a great martial arts film, but also drama. You learn to cheer it's so great. The fight scenes are sheer genius. In bambo trees, nightime in a villiage. Far superior to Gladiator , which took the Best Picture award 2001 Oscar night. This film was incredibly entertaining, beautiful, and, just, great. See it. Summary: A BEAUTIFUL, ENTERTAINING, WONDERFUL FILM.
