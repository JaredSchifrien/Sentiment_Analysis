This was a good movie, the acting was a little over the top and the dialog was some what corny but it gave it the 1940's feel. The story is good and some what believable but the effects were great. Why has there not been a sequal or a TV version. Update: Their has been a sequal and it looked like it was done on the cheap, which is why I have not seen it yet.
