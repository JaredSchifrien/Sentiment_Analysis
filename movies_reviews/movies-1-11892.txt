This movie was totally gross, and filled with so much filth that I could barely watch until the ending. I thought the Prince Albert scene was repulsive as well. Save your time and money and don't ever watch this piece of trash if you know what is good for you.....I was totally shocked that Christina Applegate would have chose such a role....
