I thought BRAVEHEART was by far one of the best movies I've seen and is in my opinon one of the best films of the decade.the cinematogrophy was one of it's weak pionts; but the acting was ecellent.Mel Gibson did a great job, though I would not recommend it to who has trouble watching war like movies do to it's graphic content. Otherwise amazing story, great acting and truly inspirational
