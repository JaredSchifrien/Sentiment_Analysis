It wasn't the best done movie of 2000 (it was well done), but it's real. I admit it, I fall for true feel good stories. Take two segregated schools. The white school has a great football team and a storied coach. The black school isn't quite there. Merge them. Take the black school's coach (Denzel Washington) and make him the head coach. Make the new school a winner. Nobody will believe it? Well, it's real life and it's touching. See it!
