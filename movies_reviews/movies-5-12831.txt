Outstanding music movie. Sarah Share does a great job of walking the tightrope between glorifying and villifying the genius and self destructive bent of Shane MacGowan. You leave the movie not exactly sure what to think - will he be dead in 5 years? Will he go sober? Can he go sober and still be himself? However the story ends, the life he has lived to date is interesting to say the least... if you like the punk rock scene, and you enjoy the Pogues, you should not miss this movie.
