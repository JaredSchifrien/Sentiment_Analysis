The nonfiction much-written-about events of this movie were not at all new to me, yet the impact of seeing 'End of the Spear' was fresh, heart-piercing, motivating, and if ever the word should be used: poignant, that's what it was, poignant. U.S. missionaries in Ecuador seek out unreached cannibalistic Waodani tribe and are killed by them, and that's the beginning. Family members of missionaries then go to live with the tribe which then places trust in Christ. This redemption movie is told thru the eyes of a killed missionary's son. Highly recommend for Christians--don't know about nonChristians, they might find the concept absurd. For ex, when the son as a kid asked his dad if they would shoot the Waodani if attacked, the dad said, "Son, we can't shoot the Waodani, they're not ready for heaven, we are." (Well-done and beautiful film, but suspend disbelief as regards the failure of makeup to show aging of characters over decades.)
