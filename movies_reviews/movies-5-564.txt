Superb! A most deftly created intricate storyline coupled with fantastic acting and character development, reminiscent of older Coen classics, better than most of the over-rated Tarantino yarns... kudos to Bryan Singer, Byrne, Spacey and the rest of them, a masterpiece from beginning to end, especially the end.
