Not only do my kids love watching this over and over, but it's a movie that my husband and I enjoy watching with them also. Pixar has outdone themselves with Nemo...the humor is perfectly balanced with a character-building plot. Great themes in this movie like loyalty, empathy and living life as the adventure that it is. I agree with others that Ellen D. was great, if not the best, in this movie. BUY IT...it's one of those kid movies that will actually get watched at your house!
