I agree completely with Leis -- one of the best ever music movies. The music is good, and the story is heartwarming. The Christmas season just isn't the same for me if I don't manage to catch this movie! The actor who plays the general, can't remember his name, is wonderful and the scene at the end with the reunion of many of his men makes me cry every time!
