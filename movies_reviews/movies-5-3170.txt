Thought this was a great thriller. It's about 2 orphaned teens forced to live with a rich couple, but they're not what they seem to be. Script was well done and so was the acting. It has a lot of suspense and surprises. Leelee Sobieski starred as the oldest child and did an excellent job. Also in it was Diane Lane and Bruce Dern.
