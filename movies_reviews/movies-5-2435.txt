I've said it many times in my other reviews and sorry to regurgitate stale information, but I'm not a Michael Mann fan AT ALL. Hes done some really good work - Ali - and some work that was good, but I found hard to appreciate - The Insider and Heat, but after watching Collateral I had a strange appreciation for Michael Mann as a director and his past work. He worked all three main characters - Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx and Jada Pinkett-Smith - HARD. I know there are a few reviewers on this site that don't think highly of Tom Cruise as an actor, but when he makes films like these you often wonder what more is he capable of doing. He made his character Vincent very humane by showing he had a conscience. This has to be one of Cruise's best performances along with Jerry Maguire, Magnolia and Born on the Fourth of July. This film was well written, superbly directed and for once I actually believed some of Hollywoods finest A-Listers in the $30million bracket when they looked scared in a movie. If you like thrillers your going to love this film and even if you don't its well worth seeing.
