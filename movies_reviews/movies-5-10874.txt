One of the best movies I ever saw. I think it's so much as the atmosphere that I liked. Very funny, a lot of memorable quotes like every movie should have, and lovable characters, (Brick: I would like to extend to you, an invitation to...to the pants party..) Will Ferrell fits Ron Burgundy PERFECTLY and it gave a warm delight when surprise guests appeared (Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller [Como estan bietches?!]) 5 STARS!
