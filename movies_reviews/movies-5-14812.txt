I still can't believe over in America they had to have subtitles for this film. If you think that was a heavy Scottish accent in the film, you haven't heard my grandad! Even I can't understand him! Right, back to the film. The issue in the film was very contraversial when it was first released and was seen as glamourising drug use. I have never heard so much crap in my entire life! They obviously didn't watch the film. Its very daunting, can be humourous and acted out very well. It portrays the depression of parts of society up in Scotland which also can be reflected to anywhere in the modern world. Outstanding.
