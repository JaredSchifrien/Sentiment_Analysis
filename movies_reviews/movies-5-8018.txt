What an absolute classic. Stripes was among the first R rated movies that I saw and was the first one that I ever taped off of HBO. I probably wore the tape out I watched it so much. Bill Murray is incredible and really carries the movie. Yet, it is the understated performance by Harold Ramis which is probably my favorite. The first part of the movie is definitely better and perhaps the movie drags on a little, but this is still one of the funniest movies of all-time with some of the most memorable lines. And, with John Candy, Judge Reinhold, and John Laroquette in supporting roles, the cast is great. As the capper, the film taught me what a loofah was.
