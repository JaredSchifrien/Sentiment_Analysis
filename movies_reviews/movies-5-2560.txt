I loved the skewbald horse and because I'm going to live in shanghai it was just good to watch some of thier history. The story-line was geat and it was very funny in places as well as having my hero/idol actor Owen Wilson in it. On most movies you can sometimes tell what's going to happen. On Shanghai Noon unexpecting things happen alot.
