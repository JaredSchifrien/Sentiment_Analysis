I was reading through some of the comments below and they said things along the lines of "Oh this was a terrible movie because it was just Michael Moore's opinion and it is wrong and he lied." News flash: It is SUPPOSED to be Michael Moore's opinion. Which is why he made the movie. As much as you say that he lied and presented biased information, it is just balancing out for the media which is in my opinion, more biased than Moore. I turn on Fox news for a good laugh. And about the part of him comparing deaths by gunfire in the US to other countries, maybe it would have been more afective if he had done it in percentage to population, but if you havn't already figured it out. 11,000 something deaths in the US is a higher percentage than 20 something in Japan. In this documentary he presented excellent points, and I agreed with him on most of what he said. Not only that but it was a nice movie to watch, at times it was incredibly funny, and others were very emotional. And if he made millions off the movie, it's because people liked it.
