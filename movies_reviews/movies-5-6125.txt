This movie is actually scarier than the horror films of today, which have a lot more graphic and gratuitous violence. Bette Davis is terrifying as the vicious caretaker of her invalid sister-the scene where she serves her sister a dinner of cooked parakeets(her sister's pets) is frighening and horrifying indeed. Bette Davis chews up the scenery as the loony-toons sister, who despises her sibling. Joan Crawford (of wire-hanger fame) also does a decent job as the mild, long-suffering sister.
