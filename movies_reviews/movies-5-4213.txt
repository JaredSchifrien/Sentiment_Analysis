I loved Monsters Inc. I laughed, I cried, I want to have a monster in my closet. These are some of the coolest and most entertaining animated characters i have ever watched. Pixar knows how to build the type of movies that pull all the right heart strings. They know how to fill a film with good hearted humor and a warm and loving heart. I left the theater with my eyes brimming with tears of happiness and sentimental joy. I absolutly loved Monster Inc and found it to be yet another comendable film in the tradition of Toy Story 1 and 2. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! Steve Buscimi is great as the bad guy monster Randal. Boo is too friggin cute.
