This is the best movie in the world. Why is it ranked with She's all that and Notting Hill Not only are the characters down to realistic, but they're hilarious! Brodie Bruce is my hero. His sarcastic wit is so perfect. I laugh harder everytime I see it. Jay and Silent Bob are the REAL American Badasses! Their scemes are just so well worked out. The girls did well, and not's forget T.S.. I recommend this movie and a Big donut. Kudos to the cast. Mr. Jason Lee, you rock! Words cannot express the love I have of this movie. I watch it every day!
