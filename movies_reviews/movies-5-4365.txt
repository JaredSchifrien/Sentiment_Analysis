Another all-time "good bad" movie that's fun for any age. The main plot trigger is far-fetched (piracy along the Oregon coast?), but you're not watching it with an historical treatise in mind, anyway. This is one to plop down onto a recliner with (snuggled under a blanket with some popcorn on a cold, nothing day) and take in unfettered. Great names associated with the production (Spielberg and Chris Columbus), and a raft of 80s actors (Corey Feldman, Kerri Green, LOTR's Sean Astin, Ke Huy Quan, the inimitable John Matuszak, Anne Ramsey, Martha Plimpton, etc.) that you can't help but cheer for. FANTASTIC sets and locations (hardly anything prettier than Astoria), non-stop action (virtually free of all that rubbery CGI), and pratfalls and guffaws that translate well 20 years later. If you can't find something to like about this screen fave, you're just not trying very hard. Good enough!
