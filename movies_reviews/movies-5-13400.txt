I remember I saw this movie when I was younger, and though I didn't understand it very well, I loved it anyway. Forrest Gump is one of the most brilliant movies made so far. Tom Hanks worked his best at being Forrest. God, I just love that guy! Anyway, back to the movie. It's a very original and sentimental movie. Don't know how anyone wouldn't like it. That's all I have to say about that...
