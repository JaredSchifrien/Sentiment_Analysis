Terrific movie! You actually can feel what James Caviezal is going through and by the end of the movie you will want the revenge just as bad as he does. I like this movie so much because the revenge is clever and carefully planned, unlike every other movie where a guy just gets a gun and starts killing everyone, but this is very clever and the actors do a terrific job on opposite ends of each other.
