 The Tailor of Panama, a spy story set in Panama after the ousting of Manuel Noriega, is a really bad movie. My husband and I saw it yesterday, and we both agreed that it deserved no more than one star. The plot is ridiculous, and the acting is terrible. Pierce Brosnan's character, a really sleazy James Bond wannabe, was a huge disappointment. I don't recommend watching this movie, even when it comes out on television. Two thumbs way down!
