Gone with the Wind depicts a bygone era of grace and charm of the old south. while the love story was intermixed with the civil war, it shows how women had to be strong to survive. Scarlette was the epitomy of all the grace, charm and slyness of women back then. Her devilish charm won many hearts and I wish for a short time...we could all experience that period of time.
