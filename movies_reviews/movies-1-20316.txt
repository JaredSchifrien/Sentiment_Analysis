Jason Takes Manhatten is just a very very bad movie. Why you ask? Well,first the movie really doesn't take place in Manhatten. It takes place on a boat and than there in manhatten at the last 15 mins of the movie. -8 mins in the sewers. Then,the deaths.The death scenes were weak.There's a coal/rock death,gkass slashing,and the boxing death being one of the goofiest deaths ever.Than last,there's the awful acting.Horrible,like in most of the F13 movies but in this,they don't even attempt to act,even the lead character.And is that ugly little kid that haunts the girl actually scary? Geez. This movie is terrible.Do not watch this movie,I warned you.
