This is a classic movie in the philosophy of using a minimum of sets (obviously). It is basically a story signifying the importance of holding one's convictions even in the face of complete opposition when one believes they are right, and may have a perception, and a perspective, which others may be lacking. It also is a classic in the art of persuasion of others towards one's own point of view. All the characters are also excellently cast. A very good, worthwhile movie.
