Incredible!!! What do we do now that Jim Henson is no longer with us? Who's going to give us such imagination in a movie? This movie is timeless. I was watching it the other day and my teenage nieces tried to make fun of it saying that it was for kids.before I new it they were hooked. The next day when I woke up they were watching it again. Sure technology has brought us far with all the computer animation, but how I miss the puppets. I only wish that Jim Henson could have done at least three more movies like this.
