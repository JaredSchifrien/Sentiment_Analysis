GREAT MOVIE! Its teaches kids so many different lessons in life. It is the best disney animated movie I've ever seen- better than beauty and the beast, better than cinderella! It has great songs that the characters in the movie sing, and i actually enjoy listening to them! most disney movies that have those songs hurt my ears...but i LOVE the lion king! I also ENCOURAGE you to see the Lion King play- on broadway, its beautiful! it was worth every penny.
