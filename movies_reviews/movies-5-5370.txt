The Women is a "Shearer" delight. A wonderful story all about men, without a single man in the film! Rivals Joan Crawford ( who is the best character in this film, bar none ) and Norma Sheerer, ( who is a bit annoying, as she is very naive ) star in one of thee best comedies in classic film history. It's interesting to see these two ladies work together, as Joan's first movie role was to play Norma's stand in, in an early film. Norma treated Joan as though she should be graetful she even had a part in her film. Norma was a big star then, and apparently had quite a big head as well. Its funny that Joan should replace her, in just a few years, as MGM's biggest box office draw. Wonder what Norma thought then? Anyways, to get back to the point, the Women is a wonderfully witty, well acted, 1930's film'
