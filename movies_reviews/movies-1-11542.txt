Let me start off my review by posing a simple question: WHY IN THE HELL HAS THIS MOVIE BEEN CONSIDERED A COMEDY CLASSIC FOR 25 FREAKIN' YEARS?! All the so-called humor in this movie consists of sex and d**k jokes, none of which rise above the kind of thing I heard in high school. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a prude, and I can very much enjoy raunchy sexual humor when it's done well, but I couldn't belive how wholly unfunny "Porky's" was. It was entertaining in a way- I wasn't bored by it- but aside from one or two moments that made me chuckle, there just wasn't anything funny about it. Why this has become a cult favorite and is regarded as a classic 80s comedy, I'll never know. If you want to see a genuinely funny movie from this era, try "National Lampoon's Vacation" and skip this crap.
