I love this movie. Now my kids love this movie. There is nothing like this wonderful escape into a world of fantasy where the good ones come out the victors. Sadly, I only realized in recent years that the scarecrow, tinman and the lion are the same people as those on the farm (I can be a bit slow sometimes). A great tale of friendship, determination and realization.
