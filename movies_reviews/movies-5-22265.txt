A great, great sci-fi movie. How cool was Schwarzenegger as the unstoppable killer robot from the future? I remember reading somewhere that Arnold was offered the role of either the hero or the villan in this movie, and, against the advice of his friends and managers, he decided to be the villan. Turns out it was the smartest move he could have made. Schwarzenegger's acting is so terrible that he plays a semi-human robot to perfection.
