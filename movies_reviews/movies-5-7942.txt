This is among Bill Murray's greatest movies. Imagine having to live the same day over and over again. I wonder how much of this was ad-libbed. Chris Elliot has a small role and manages to be funny just saying thanks for a cup of coffee! This is a rare comedy that is worth watching over and over again.
