'Giant'. The name speaks for itself. Edna Ferber wrote the novel, and George Stevens directed this movie. Perhaps the only thing wrong with this movie is its immense length. Otherwise, the movie is a landmark. It is especially poignant because it is James Dean's last movie. Anyone who has seen it can never erase from memory the final James Dean sequence where his character, Jett Rink, is drunk and alone in the ballroom making a speech. This piece of acting only lends to the myth of how much untapped potential Dean possessed. And let's not forget the memorable cast, including Rock Hudson and Elizabeth Taylor (who gives one of her great performances ever). When all is said and done, there can be no denying that this movie is definitely one for the ages.
