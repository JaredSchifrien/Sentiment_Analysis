 Sixth Sense is my all time favorite horror movie. I watch horror movies all the time, so it takes a lot for a movie to make me jump. Sixth Sense not only made me jump, but had me crying for my mom and gripping my best friends hand throughout the entire movie. From the moment the guy is in Bruce Willis' bathroom, to the end where Haley's character is in the car with his mom at an accident scene, you are petrified with fear. I was so scared after the movie that I had to read happy children's books, and sleep in bed with my sister with the light on all night. I've never been that scared after a movie. I think the reason the movie had such an effect on me because I've always felt that there are beings around us at all times, we just can't see them.
