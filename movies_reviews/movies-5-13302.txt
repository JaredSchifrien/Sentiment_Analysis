Again, Steven Spielberg has triumphed. He is a shockingly creative man, to take one war and create two masterpieces, emotionally charged, star-studded, brutally realistic, sparing no expense. This man makes beautiful movies. A wide range of people can enjoy and appreciate this movie--Veterans of this war, veterans of any war, students studying wartime, children of veterans, adults who knew someone who knew someone who died in the war, etc. This movie epitomizes the unbelievable sacrifice made time and again by our countrymen to keep our country and this world free. This movie has the power to make young people of peacetime appreciate the turmoil of people their age in wartime. Superbly acted, as Spielberg makes sure all his films are, though Damon's part is comparatively small, it is remarkably memorable, his fresh-faced youth almost painful to see amongst such rubble and conflict. As he speaks of better times with his dead brothers, it is heartbreaking. Tom Hanks, one of the acting greats of our time, delivers an Oscar-worthy performance, and I believe he speaks to the nation when he tells Private James Ryan to EARN IT.
