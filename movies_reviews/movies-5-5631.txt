My personal favorite Hitchcock film. It's so well written, acted, and directed that as the suspence builds slowly up, you become more and more engrossed until the film sucks you in and you forget where you are. Also, the entire film is done in one place, and that's cool. It shows Hitch's real sense of the film when he could make it where it was so entertaining with only one set. Many of today's directors would be so creative.
