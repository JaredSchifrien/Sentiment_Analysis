I never cry. I am a grown man who feels it very important never to let anybody see him cry. Thank GOD I was watching this movie alone at the time. I have to say though that when I saw the movie for the second time it was not completely logical. For example, if he could figure out he was dead at the end while observing his wife's agony, why not earlier when he was investigating the boy, etc.?
