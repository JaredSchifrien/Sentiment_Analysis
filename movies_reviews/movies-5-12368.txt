Definetely the best of the 4 movies. Had a better and more mature story line to it, just like the book, and for the most part, stayed close to the book. The characters were better played, and the new characters ie: Cedric, Fleur, Krum, Cho, etc. were amazing. Great special effects in the challenges, especially the dragon scene, and very emotional and scary.
