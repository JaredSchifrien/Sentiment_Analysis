the cast did a great job..it was a pretty tought movie to do but they pulled it off..hats off to them..really enjoyed this movie..i think this is shyamalans best movie.the concept was really good,. the movie was scary at times and had a tinge of humour in it..absolutely loved it... and the little girl was scary in the movie..hehe\mel gibson and phoenix and the other kid did a good job..shyamalan is the god of sci-fi
