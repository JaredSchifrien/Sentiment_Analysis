Only Stephen King can combine the Ramones with a horror movie and do it well. The movie is one of the scariest I've seen, i still shudder at Zelda. And hey, if you can't sit through the whole movie like i have over 30 times, then just watch the ending, scary,scary,bam!!,climax!!......Ramones! Best ending to a movie by far.
