This is more than just a movie. It's a visual masterpiece. The desert scenes are truly spectacular. The audience when I saw this picture actually started to applaud shortly after the film began. This is truly one film that must be seen on the big screen. I have not been so moved by the beauty of a film since David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia.
