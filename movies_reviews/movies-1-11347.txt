Britany Murphy is one of the worst actresses on the planet. I won't tell you how I really feel about her. This movie was a predictable load of crap. I like Dakota Fanning, but her character was such a obnoxious bratty little twit. One could predict the next line, the next scene and how it was going to end. Don't waste your time or money on the DVD either.
