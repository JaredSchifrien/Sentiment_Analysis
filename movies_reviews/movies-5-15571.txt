Is there a higher rating? My review for this movie might exceed anyone elses here. The people who are bad-mouthing Titanic can not see between the line of criticism. James Cameron has created a substantial film for history (as far as the CGI visual splender) and this love story should have enough touching moments to carry the most heartless of us through the 3-plus hours of nasty co-stars, the small amount of cheesy dialoge, the intensity of drowning, and all the horrible floating bodies. I've been a Cameron fan since The Terminator, he's never disappointed me (with his movies) and if he keeps making his masterpieces, I could never get tired of seeing movies.
