Chalk this one up to my sentimental favorites. I love this movie. Swayze and Jennifer Grey did this movie years before Dirty Dancing. It also had C. Thomas Howell and several others young stars of the day. Kids from Michigan fighting Soviet invaders using whatever weapons they could russle up. A truly inspiring movie and one should hope it will give everyone the courage to stand and fight if an actual invasion of the US ever happens as it did in this movie.
