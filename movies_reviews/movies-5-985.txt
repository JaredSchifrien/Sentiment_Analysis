Platoon is one of the best Vietnam movies made. While I was seriously considering giving it 4 stars, aka Good, I decided to give it 5, because it isn't just good, it's great. The fact that Oliver Stone was in the war himself makes it that much more believable. A haunting experience that really delivers the good. The acting makes it more believable, Sheen's performance is great, as is Dafoe's and Berenger's. I recommend this highly. It certainly deserved the Best Picture Oscar. A must-see. Summary: THE 3RD BEST 'NAM MOVIE. BRILLIANT.
