What makes this movie excellent is not the landscape happy direction by Sean Penn, but rather the sad and mellow performance by Jack Nicholson, who is obviously always incredible. This time, however, his worn and tired look matched with his obsessive tendencies and he was at peace and unrest in a way that not many other actors are capable of. I enjoyed this somber film very much.
