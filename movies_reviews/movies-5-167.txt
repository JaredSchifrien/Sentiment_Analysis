Have to disagree with Irish about this, but the portrayal was more accurate than he might know. The blue paint was a symbolic reference in homage to their Scottish ancestors , the Picts, The Painted Ones. The face only blue paint was, actually, theatrical. The Picts stripped naked and painted their entire bodies blue....to appear fierce...an ancient attempt at psychological warefare.
