I've watched this movie several times and each time I watch it it reaffirms my belief that it is the best film ever made. Everything in it is done perfectly. The acting, the suspense, the soundtrack, the dialogue and the theme of idealism over love. I can't think of a better 20 minutes in a movie than when Ilsa first enters to the end of the flashback in France. This movie will just get better as time goes by.
