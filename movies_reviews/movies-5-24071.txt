Excellent movie, tons of action; a bit on the artsy side (okay, VERY artsy), but extremely well done. Takes place two thousand years ago in a war-torn China, where provinces vie for control over the land, particularly the ruler of Qin. Tyrants make many friends as well as many enemies, and this is the story of four such enemies/friends. What you would expect from the trailers don't come close to what you really get, it's a complete surprise. Even though some of the fight scenes are a little silly (a la Crouching Tiger), it's visually stunning, it's almost complete action all the way through. (Note: Stop here, spoilers ahead; if you don't care, then continue) I loved the multilayered take on the single story to show its many complexities. It's hard to describe how it's both simple and complex (with regards to storyline) simultaneously. It's very big on symbolism, particularly with color. It has a feel of a fable to it, though I don't know if it's based on anything historical/mythological. (the website suggests it's very loosely based on history, at least; go to http://www.herothemovie.com/ for more info.) Anyway, DEFINATELY worth watching.
