I really loved this movie. I know because it appeals to the weepy-girl type inside me. Also because it was one of the few movies that could show really the true nature of love. Just how much it really hurts sometimes and how things don't always go the way you'd want or expect them to. It had a happy smiley-ending, though, and I liked that. Sanaa Lanthan and Omar Epps gave wonderful performances, as did the actors who played their respective parents. ( I think to this day that Alfre Woodard is one of the most beautiful women in the world.) This movie is defiently a keeper
