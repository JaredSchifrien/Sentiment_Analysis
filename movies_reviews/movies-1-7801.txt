I laughed only once during all of 'Happy Gilmore,' and it was at a joke that can't be printed here. Adam Sandler is a funny man, but not when he is throwing clubs around and in general acting like a spoiled, immature brat. The plot twists are stupid, the fake hand is grotesque, and the ending has the type of roll-your-eyes cheesiness that makes it so bad it's almost good. The key word, though, is 'almost.'
