I think Fargo is an excellent movie because it's not what you expect. I don't even know what I thought it was going to be about, but when I heard about a wood chipper, I had to see it. The performances were excellent, right down to the accents (and yes, people do talk like that in N.D/MN, it wasn't an exaggeration, I was born in Fargo). I think this was William H. Macy's best performance (portraying Jerry Lundergard). I love it when the finance company keeps hounding him about the VIN numbers for the vehicles, truly helarious. I questioned why the movie was called Fargo. After all, the only scene that took place in Fargo was the first five minutes of the movie, where the deal was set. The majority of the movie took place in Brainard MN. Then I finally got it. Would you rather see a movie called Fargo or Brainard ? Makes sense, huh?
