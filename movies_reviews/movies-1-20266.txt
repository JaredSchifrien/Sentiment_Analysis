I used to be able to say I Know What You Did Last Summer was the worst horror movie ever. At least it tried to develope characters, tried to be interesting, tried to be original. This film misses every beat and fails at even being a movie worth pissing on. If anything I laughed myself silly whenever Dracula himself showed up. He reminded me of Neo from the Matric. Does every actor have to over and under act? There is no middle ground acting wise in this film. This movie only succeeding in taking my money. Now I am a messanger. If you have a taste for unintintionaly funny movies go for it. If you want a good hunk of horror, go rent the Shinning.
