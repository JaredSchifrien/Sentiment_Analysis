If you don't like base humour - then this isn't for you. The first time I saw this film I was in absolute stitches and it never fails to crack my up. I don't know what the college scene is like in America, but if its like this then I'd love to go over and have a peek. My favouritw scene has to be when Bluto is in the cafeteria piling food onto his tray - he actually stuffs a whole hamburger into his mouth! And when he sits down a girl says That boy is a P.I.G His response is to put some white ice cream into his mouth and says guess what I am now hits his cheeks so its sprays out of his mouth and says a zit then proceeds to start a food fight. An absolutely fantastic film which is definately a cult classic (it was also the first film Kevin Bacon starred in)
