The first time I watched this movie I have to admit I was quite disturbed. The direction, script, acting and music were done so well that the emotional bang that hits you in the end is almost too much to bear. It was done so well that I was as close as I have ever been to walking out of the theatre because of the feeling the movie gave me. When the movie starts to spiral into the darkness that is the character's lives, you clench your fists together and pray for some glint of hope. The second time you watch Requiem for a Dream, you notice how beautiful the character's lives were at the beginning, and how the this time around its less disturbing and all around more depressing. A beautiful movie all around.
