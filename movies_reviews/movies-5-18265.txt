This is another one of those movies that I am not too sure why I like so much. And then I look as Jason Patric (not now..see Speed 2? No? I didn't think so) and all becomes clear. Seriously, though, this movie is really, very enjoyable. It's scary, but not too scary, dark, but not too dark. It's like baby bear's porridge: just right.(I apologize for the terrible comparison.) It should be appreciated not only for the surprisingly good acting (which is crazy not only because this is an eighties movie, but because it is also a horror movie as well.) but for it's originality. Most vampire movies are a dime a dozen *cough* John Carpenter's Vampires *cough* Forsaken (sorry, honey :*)*cough*, but the Lost Boys breathed new life into the floundering Vampire movie genre. I also like it because it doesn't drag on too long with those hated 'tenseful' violent death scenes. The vamps die and then we move on. Very healthy. And one would be remiss if one did not mention the lovely soundrack. The concert scene with the scary indian looking man has to be on of the most entertaining moments in the entire movie. And, although at times the songs are annoying, they are fun in that they offer a flash of nostalga and rememberance of good times. Okay, no, they are just really goofy, but sometimes that is the best approach. I only have really one kinda bad thing to say about this film. What is that ugly kid thing that Starr always has around? Apparently it is a boy, but lordy you could have fooled me. But in all, It's a classic.
