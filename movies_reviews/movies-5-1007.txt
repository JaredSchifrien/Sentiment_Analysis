Along with Lethal Weapon, Die Hard easily makes my list of the top action films of the lasy 20 years. It's your typical shoot em' up flick with Willis playing the macho cop John McClane, who must face off terrorists in an office building 3,000 miles out of his jurisdiction. Solid performances by Willis and Reginald Veljohnson are the film's high points, but the biggest props have to go to Alan Rickman, a relatively unknown actor who played the role of Hans Gruber very convincingly. Overall, Die Hard is the film to watch if you're looking for some good action mixed with a little bit of comedy.
