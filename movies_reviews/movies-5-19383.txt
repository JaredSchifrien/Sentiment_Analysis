John Malkovich is terrific, as is Willem Dafoe. I had to study Nosferatu in a Film Studies class and so it was a lot of fun to see this version of the story. I also liked the honesty about the drug problems that were rampant in that time that seems to be forgotten when it is glorified in other films.
