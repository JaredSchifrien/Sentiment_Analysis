It's worth seeing just for that magnificent car-chase, probably the best one ever filmed. There are plenty in other movies that are crazy and violent, but this one is like a REAL chase, as realistic as though you were in it yourself. Also notable about FC is the psychological depth--you really see the investigator coming unglued with his own obsession. Much richer than most Hollywood fare.
