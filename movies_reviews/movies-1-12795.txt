Well if you overlook the fact that his assertions about McDonald's are complete supposition based on scientifically inadmissible evidence then the film is only, well, a piece of crap. Mr. Spurlock makes no compelling case against McDonald's or fast food in general. He accuses McDonald's of being interested only in the bottom line, yet when his doctor's advise him to discontinue his experiment he bravely forges on so he can finish his film and sell it to the masses. Who's interested in the bottom line now Mr. Spurlock?
