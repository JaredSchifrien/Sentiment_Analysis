Once I saw the Fellowship, I couldn't wait for the Two Towers to come out. And the only bad thing about the Two Towers is it makes it that much harder to wait for the Return of the King. One of the very best movies of all time. You just don't know what you're missing until you've been a part of the Lord of the Rings!
