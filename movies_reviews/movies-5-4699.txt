Holes was an awsome movie. They had all the right people play all the right parts. The movie is way better then the book cause you can acually feel like your there. Expailly the pats when like it would flash back to like the older days. I give this movie 5 stars cause I feel like I have some sort of connection with it. I spent all my money to see this movie in theaters. Also to rent and I kept it over time so I had to pay a lot extra and I still havent returned it. If I could I would rate it more stars. cause this movie was exellent and I luv this movie. This is one of my all time favorite movie. Nice job to the people who made the movie. And an extra Nice job to all the D-tent Boys.
