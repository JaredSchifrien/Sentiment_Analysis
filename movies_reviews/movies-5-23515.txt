Carpenter isnt the best director, but the story is genius (Campbell's Who goes there? ) and he totally lucked out getting Rob Bottin and Mike Ploog and Dean Cundy and Morricone's score and the rest. It is a masterpiece. I believe a good movie should affect you. This movie scared the living crap out of me. Bravo!
