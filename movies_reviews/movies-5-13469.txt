I love Stand BY Me. Four boys age 12 go off to find the body of a 12 year old who was feared dead.It takes place it the late 1950s. this is mainly about friendship between the boys.All four boys have their own issues to deal with. in their personnal lives. they are at the end of childhood and on the brink of adolesance. this movie is a combination of humor, and sadness.All the kid actors are great. A well done movie.
