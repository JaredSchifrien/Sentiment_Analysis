Oh man, we used to watch this movie so often in college during those hazy late nights after being out. I remember seeing the movie in the theaters with my folks and sister when I was a kid and I loved it then and still do. So many big name actors got their 'start' in this movie. Plot line is how the Japanese are trying to find Hollywood to bomb it in the year of 1941. Great comedy. Slim Pickens has a great role in this movie (short one, but great). 'Delicious, nutritious carmel coated popper snacks!!!' I am not the biggest fan of Ferris wheels to this day because of a particular scene in the movie. 'See this grapefruit? I think it's rotten. Yep, it's rotten I'm going to throw it. It's going, it's going, it's going, it's going, it's going....it's gone'. I cannot tell you how many girls a buddy of mine and myself annoyed in college at parties and bars when we would shake imaginary grapefruits and recite that line. I guess this review does not give too much insight into the movie, just shows that this was one of those movies that happened to be a favorite of mine for a particular period of time. I am not sure what other people think about it, but just thinking about it now makes me want to go and rent it tonight.
