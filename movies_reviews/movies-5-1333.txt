Arguably Taratino's best film, this one packs in the most excitement and the best writing. Harvey Keitel is excellent as MR. White and Steve Buscemi plays a wonderful Mr. Pink, but Tim Roth is the real show stopper as Mr. Orange (Freddy Nuindike). Tarantino make an appearance as Mr. Brown and Lawrence Tierney is a tough but funny crime boss. Michael Madsen's Mr. White cahracter get to have most of the fun (i.e. cutting the ear of of Marvin Nash the captured police officer, and generally playing it cool). The constant backdrop of K-Billy's Super Sounds of the seventies makes the perfect frame for this film. Best Scene: Are you gonna bark all day little doggy, or are you gonna bite?
