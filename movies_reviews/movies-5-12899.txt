It's rare for a movie these days to take it's time telling a story, and that's what Shawshank Redemption does. This film is very well written, well acted and compelling from beginning to end. There's no explosions, there's no silliness, it's just a simple, warm, honest, comtemplative film with a story that brings the audience along with it. Great movie; you'll think it ends too quickly.
