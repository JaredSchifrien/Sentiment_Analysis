Such intelligent and sophisticated direction is perfectly complimented by Quentin Tarantino's masterful screenwriting. Nobody turns a phrase quite like the Knoxville native. This is by far the most popular film he's ever directed and yet it may not even be the best. In Pulp Ficiton he takes what he did in Reservoir Dogs with unchronological story telling and refines it beautifully. Reservoir Dogs my be the more exciting of two, but this one is more concise and important. Best Scene: Jules Winfield's pre-killing monologue.
