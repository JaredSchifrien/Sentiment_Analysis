This was such a great movie! I loved it. It was sweet and it kind of relates to how girls act when they are young and will do anything to be popular. But in this movie, it proves that bening popular isn't the best thing you can have and that you should stick with your true friends. This movie showed a message and it was great! If you haven't seen this movie, It is a definite movie that you should go see
