Zany British humor cannot be done better than by the Monty Python troop. My father made me watch this when I was young, and ever since then, I have been hooked on Monty Python. Their hilarity is of a most unique brand, and this movie stands out as probably being their most widely accepted film by American audiences. There is absolutely no character development, and for good reason. Their wit is outstandingly brilliant, and this film is filled with some of the best brainless comedy around. The audio and film work are below average, probably due in part to the film's budget and its foreign development. This film is highly recommended, and now for something completely different.
