I must give this movie the 1 star because it commits the greatest sin a movie can. It's boring. Apart from an occasional South Park style laugh, this film has no point except to make fun of something without telling you why. Once you get over the novelty of puppets trying to walk you may find yourself staring at the wall beside you wondering how much better your life could have been had you not gone to this film.
