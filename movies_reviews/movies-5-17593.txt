This is the granddaddy of all adventure films. Henri-Georges Cluzot made this film about 4 men stuck in a South American village with all the dirt and grit, heat and humidity, filling the theater. They get their last chance for redemption by taking two trucks, filled with nitroglycerine over the Andes and through jungle swamps to extinguish an oil well fire. You will sit on the edge of your seat through the entire trip. Billy Friedkin remade the film as Sorcerer. I only catches the intensity.
