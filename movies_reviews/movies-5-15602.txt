Titanic is a wonderful movie and anybody who can't see that is either a fool or has to be somewhat hard hearted. Anybody should be able to like this movie! It's wonderful in every way! This movie does not stink at all and the acting is just great! I have a feeling that there are a lot of jealous people out there who will never be able to be in a movie like this so they unfaily try to drag it down with their rude and untrue comments. This is a great film that everyone should see!
