Pretentious, pointless and a waste of 2 1/2 hours of my life. I dont care how this dross is dressed up as art-house. There are dozens of plotlines (for want of a better word) and characters (ditto) that go nowhere fr'instance the 2 men in the diner talking about a nightmare, the night visit to the weird theatre, the symbolism of the blue box...I hate this film with a passion. OK Naomi Watts in the buff was alright but that's about it.
