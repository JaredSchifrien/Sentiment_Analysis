I have never understood why people like this trash. It's melodramatic, unbelievable, fantasized, etc. If people liked it for those reasons that would be understandable--just a matter of personal taste. However, they describe it as if it were some great example of fine acting. Phooey! I put it in the same category as Birth of a Nation. Romanticized racist drivel.
