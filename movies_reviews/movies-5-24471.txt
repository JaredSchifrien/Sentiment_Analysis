This is not what you d expect from Linklater. I m one of those people that was not too impressed with either Slacker or Dazed and Confused. Sure, they were entertaining and good stoner flicks. But they were far from brilliant. Maybe I was missing something. So I expected something similar from Waking Life. But I was really amazed. This movie is extraordinary! The animation thing is quite new for me, but it works really well. The whole movie plays like a dream montage, but everything also fits together seamlessly into a whole. The movie also leaves you wondering about a lot of things. This is definitely something I am glad to own, because I m going to have to revisit parts of it to get a better understanding of some of the philosophical concepts they were addressing.
