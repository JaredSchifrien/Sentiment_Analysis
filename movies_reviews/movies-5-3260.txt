This is my favorite movie of all time. It stars Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts, 2 of the top stars in movie history, both in possibly their best roles ever. Mel Gibson is fabulous is a conspiracy nut who gets a bit to close to the truth and Julia Roberts is the D.A. that gets a little to close to Mel. Patrick Stewart is also superb as the evil psychiatrist . This is definitely a must see. It is rated R, but easily could have passed for PG, considering there is no sexuality, minor profanity (approx. 25 profane words ) and mid amounts of violence, non of it is gory however. I would recommend this to anyone.
