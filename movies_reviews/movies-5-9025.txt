Definately a different type of comedy... and certainly John Cusack at his best! This movie is so hilariously funny and as others have said, extremely quotable. I'm a girl and I loved this movie. So women, don't assume this is a boys only movie. It may have silly humor that men would normally like better than women, but it's also got its romance in there too.
