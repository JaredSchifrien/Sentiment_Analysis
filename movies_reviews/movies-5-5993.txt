Now this movie was so funny and you never know what was gonna happen. I think this is one the most funniest court movies ever made. The lawyer is so funny and trying to make sense with all that had happen. Then the punchline at the end that he would be the lawyer for the next case was so hillarious that I couldn't stop laughing. If you have not seen this movie, you will surely love this movie!
