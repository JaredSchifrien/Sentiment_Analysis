It was a great movie that i felt welcome back Hitchcock . If H tchcock was alive he probably would give the same rating to this film. I strongly recommend this film to all psychologic-stress film lovers. Also Pfeiffer is again excellent both with her beauty and her act which gives the horror scenes double or triple effect. This film should be seen!
