Besides the fact that Pulp Fiction had all the elements of a great movie done by an brilliant writer/director, it served also a gateway to a lot of people. It proved to so many that a film doesn't require a lot of money to be truly a piece of cinematic art and indie films were finally getting the attention they deserved. It inspired a host of Tarantino imitators to create colorful, violent crime films from the sublime ( The Usual Suspects ) to the mere forgettable ( Truth or Consequences,NM ). But what is so amazing about this film (and hasn't even been touched on in this slew of reviews) is that with Tarantino, nothing is sacred and everything is fair game! Accidental murder results in name calling and a hilarious aftermath, sodomy/rape results in a comical bit where Butch can't make up his mind which weapon to save his enemy with, racial slurs are used repeatedly by a white guy who, consequently, is married to an African American woman, and Jules (who breaks a major commandment for a living) recites word for word a quote from the Holy Bible. This film has shined a light on the most taboo of subjects and made us not only stare in wonder, but made us take notice of the one film that mirriors society's own irreverence!
