Award-worthy documentary of the dance movements clowning and krumping, with both presented as alternatives to gangbanging. Moviegoers are drawn into the lives of individual dancers, including Tommy the Clown who started it all. Music and butt-popping dancing throughout, with the highlight being a large arena competition. If offensive language bothers you, it's mostly at the beginning and not gratuitous. If Christianity bothers you, it's mostly at the end and also not gratuitous. Inspirational (Rize) without being sugar-coated; plenty of cause for both laughing and crying. Hopefully, some grant $ and job offers will come out of this...and understanding and hope.
