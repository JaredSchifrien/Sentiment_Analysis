This one doesn't have a thing to do with Michael Myers, and it sucks. But it doesn't suck because he's not in it, it sucks because it sucks! I mean, it's really bad. It's not scary, it's just plain bad. The people who made this film must have had some serious issues with children. It didn't scare me at all, just left me with a bad feeling.
