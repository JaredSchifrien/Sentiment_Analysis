Man alive, I love this film! When it comes to singling out which movie trilogy I personally consider to be the greatest of all 'Star Wars' and 'Lord of the Rings' (or at least what I've seen of the latter), don't stand a chance - 'Back to the Future' is the movie trilogy to put all others to shame. Subtle, witty and full of cool energy, BTTF is a sharply-directed first installment for this wonderful epic, in which eighties teenager Marty McFly gets a taste of his parents' youth when he is accidentally transported back to their time in none other than a temporal-defying Delorean car! A few ill-advised actions soon leave the plucky youth fighting against the clock to save his own future from being erased from time. The acting is flawless, Michael J Fox providing the best of the best as Marty, a loveable central character with wide appeal, and Christopher Llyod too is great as benevolant scientist Doc Brown, while the whole thing moves at a skillfully dynamic pace, loaded with some really impressive special effects (at least for its day). There are moments of pure comic genius, and poignent moments that'll make you (or at least me, anyway) want to cry. Overall, this film rates in as top notch entertainment, providing a powerful mixture of action, warmth and humour, topped off with a first-rate sountrack that really hits the spot like a coke on a hot day. Absolutely wonderful!
