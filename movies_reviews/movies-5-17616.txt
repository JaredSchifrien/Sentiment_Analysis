I saw the Left Behind movie and I thought it was very well done! I read all the books and I think the movie having not been edited by Hollywood standards stayed very much along the story in the Left Behind book. I can understand why some might be threatened by the truth of the movie and I am sure that when Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye went ahead with the movie idea they were fully aware that some would react in a critical way. I once heard a man of God say that the cross is offensive in it's content, because it calls a person to be aware of thier own accountability. So it makes sense that anything referring to Christ and the cross will offend those that reject it. Having the truth of Christ given in this movie brings up the fear that unbelievers experience just like I did the first time I read the book of revelation as a non-believer. I think the acting was very refreshing.
