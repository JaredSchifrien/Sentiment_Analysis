One of my favourite films ever! Everything about it is brilliant, from the acting, directing, casting, to the plot, humour and look/feel of the film. Christian Bale is perfect as Pat Bateman and he is genuinely intense and powerful (physically and mentally) througout. The fact that I love all things New York and 80s was pretty convenient in this film! The soundtrack is great, with Huey Lewis and Phil Collins fitting in well, contrasting against the violence being portrayed. For example Huey being played while Bateman axe-murders a colleague. The idea that everyone on Wall Street at that time is anonymous is clever, such as Bateman being mistaken for other people by his own colleagues, and the displacement of identity is a foremost theme here due to commercialism and vanity. Easton Ellis' book is brilliantly written and extremely graphic (in both good, e.g. knowledge of the hit records released in the 80s, and bad ways, e.g. killing of the prostitute), although the film's locations, settings and direction are needed to complete the look to the story. Fantastic!
