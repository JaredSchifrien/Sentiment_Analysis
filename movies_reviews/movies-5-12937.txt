I can't really do this film justice in one short paragraph. Brilliant story (I'm embarrassed to say I have yet to read the Stephen King novel), perfect casting, powerful heartfelt flawless acting and possibly the most uplifting film I have ever watched! If you haven't seen Shawshank Redemption yet, then do so at the earliest opportunity.
