I am willing to bet that many people have never heard of autism before, and I give this movie credit for bringing it to the public's attention. The film is an excelent way of showing that a mental disability does not necessarily mean low intelegence. Plus, I loved watching Tom Cruise freak out constantly in this film; provided real comic relief from the drama.
