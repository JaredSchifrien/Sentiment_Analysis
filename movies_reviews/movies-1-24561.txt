My rating is for the new version of Time Machine. The original version gets 5 stars from me. The new version is simply a politically correct, diversity seeking stupid waste of money. The whole theme of the novelette was ignored in favor of knocking white people and praising anyone with brown skin. And why move the setting from London to New York? Don't waste your time with this movie (even if you agree with the politics, you are wasting your money. See the original version instead).
