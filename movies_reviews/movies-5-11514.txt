ok, i loved the humor in this one better than the first and its totally more insane... but i think they play Finch WAYYY too much. he can only be funny to a limit. also, not enough Vicky and Jessica... i dont think they even had a role. Seann William Scott and Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan pooled this movie off nicely
