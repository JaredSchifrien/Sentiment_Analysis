Compared to the first one I think this movie was just aweful. Even by itself it's still annoying. The pacing was WAY too fast and the humor was way too obnoxious. The first one at least was somewhere in the vicinity of trying to be believable. When I went to the movie, I thought she was gonna be running for office - that I think woulda been a better story idea, where she's in the next phase of her life, tackling obstacles and fighting battles at the next level of tests in maturity. But no, they basically did a repeat of the first one, where she goes to a new place where her sorority-mad perkiness is scoffed at and eventually accepted through her hard work and good-heartedness. In a word, it was lame.
