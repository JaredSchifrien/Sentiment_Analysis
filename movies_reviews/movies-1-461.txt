with respect to ford and connery, this movie is a worthless abortion. the effects are cheesy, the timing is off, the plot's not so scary, and the degeneration of serious to fluffy that must befall any remarkable franchise or trend as it gains popularity and settles into routines seems especially pronounced in this threquel. it has some funny, silly moments which are welldone, but if i had it to do over i'd just burn the seven dollars and watch t.v. for two hours.
