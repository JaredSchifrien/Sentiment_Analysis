A great phychological thriller. I was never terrorized or scarred by it. Carrie came across to me as a figure to be pittied, not be scared of. What is scary is that there are people who would treat people like Carrie that way. Carrie's mother is propably the most scarry person in the movie, if only because their are people like that out there.
