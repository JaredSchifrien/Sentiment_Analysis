This comment is for everyone who complains and says that the movie was stupid. Look if you thought that the movie was stupid then you are the ones who are stupid. The only way this movie can be considered stupid is if you don't understand it. It is basically about a boy who would rather die than be alone. In the end he knows that he is going to die, and he would rather die than live the rest of his life without the one he loves who he knows is gone. If you pay attention then the movie makes perfect sense. And to tell the truth, changed my life in a lot of different ways. If it doesn't change your life then you didn't understand it, and you shouldn't even try.
