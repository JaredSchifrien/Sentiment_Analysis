Any movie with LeeLee Sobieski is bound to be good. She is a brilliant, fantastic looking actress who always adds a touch of class to any movie. The movie itself does little to expand the horror movie genre, instead relying on tired old cliches to create an atmosphere of tension. Highly predictable, but enjoyable.
