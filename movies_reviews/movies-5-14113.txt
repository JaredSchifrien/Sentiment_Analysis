Incredable preformance by Jim Carrey. Perhaps his first drama, this movie really makes you think about life. Could you be but just another Truman, in a world modified especially for you. I walked out of the theater pondering this stupid quetion. But, I have not yet found an answer. I forget the screenwriter's name at the moment, but what a marvelous idea he(they) had. Amazing story.
