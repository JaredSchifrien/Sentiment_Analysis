I have seen a recent poll that has compared Lord of the Rings with The Godfather, Citizen Kane, and other great movies. This was amazing because the poll was top 100 movies of all time and Lord of The Rings was #1 out of those. The Movie has great sceanry and has you wide awake 100% of the time. This has won AFL's Best film of the year. And is rated for Golden Globes. This was the best film of the year and should win the best picture. The income for this movie is passing Harry Potter, because the people who have seen The Lord of The Rings hav loved it. If you havent seen this movie, you should see it NOW.
