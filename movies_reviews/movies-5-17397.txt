I thought this movie was great. It was really different. The music was really good. There isn't much dialogue but the visual aspect of the movie makes the story and since it has subtitles, it helps. This movie shows the what if. Like when you have to do something, don't you always wonder, 'what if?'. Well, this movie takes 3 possible senarios and shows you what happens. It is fascinating. I loved it.
