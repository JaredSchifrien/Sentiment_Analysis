This is my favorite movie of all time. I've read the book too (called Wise Guys ), the book and movie are equally superb. Robert Deniro portrays Jimmy the Gent beautifully (of course, would you expect any less from Deniro?). He has a certain charisma that will never be possessed by any other actor...it's undescribable. Ray Liotta did an excellent job of portraying Henry Hill..I love his cool and calm demeanor through out the movie (except when he goes into panic mode toward the end). Another great, Joe Pesci. Goodfellas is his best performance. Any guy that can portray a member of the mobb and then go on to play a crook in a kids movie (Home Alone) deserves credit. My favorite part of the movie? The scene with Billy Batts. Moral: Don't bang on the trunk. Most tantalizing movie ever! Definatley a classic!
