An awesome movie. I thought Jude Law and Nicole Kidman were great. Even though I'm not a fan of Renee Zellwegger I thought she did really good on her role. Even though I think Nicole Kidman totally pops, I don't think she should win Best Actress because there wasn't much intelligent/incredible acting she could of done in that movie.
