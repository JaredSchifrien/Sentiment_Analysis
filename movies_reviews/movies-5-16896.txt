Anyone who has rated this movie lower than a 4 is just jealous of Eminem. I am not an Eminem fan, never have been. I stepped outside of the box though and looked at this movie from a movie lovers stand point. It has a great plot. Eminem screams talent when he is acting. I thought it was gonna flop like a fish. Boy was I ever wrong!!!
