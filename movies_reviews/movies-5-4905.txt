Aside from Johnathan Lipnicki's sub-par acting, this sequel is great. I still can't find the brief mild language that forced its US PG rating (in Canada it is rated G), but believe me, its a great movie. The way the families act is great and smacks of Leave it to Beaver or Hazel. Also, the CG is great and the voice acting (led by Family Ties star Mike J. Fox) is great all the way around for the non-human characters. And, I would have to say, Snowbell has most of the great lines. :)
