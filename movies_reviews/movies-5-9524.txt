A great film totally recommended to anyone of any age. The first Rush Hour film was mildly entertaining only becuase of it's 2 main stars, but this was an extremely good movie. Chris Tucker is back as the wisecracking, high talking, bust your a$$, LAPD. And Jackie Chan once again is good as the tito of the duo. Defintiely a fine film to see, totally worth the money and time.
