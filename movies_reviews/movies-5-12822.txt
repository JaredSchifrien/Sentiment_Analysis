I've been waiting for this movie to come out for 15 years, ever since I read the book of the same name in the late 80s. The true-life story of 2 British climbers in the Andes in 1985 who summited Siula Grande, a 21,000 foot peak, then suffered a horrific catastrophe on the way down. That Joe Simpson survived to tell the tale is beyond belief. The book is extremely well-written, and one might think that the weight of expectations would make any movie pale in comparison. But this movie delivers. Sticking closely to the original tale, in a unique blend of documentary narration by the principal characters, coupled with reenactments so superb and realistic that you forget you're watching a movie, Touching the Void will stick in your mind long after you leave the theater. One of those rare movies that sucks you in so deep and so profoundly that you feel visceral shudders of horror and fear as the tale unwinds. Do not miss this movie!
