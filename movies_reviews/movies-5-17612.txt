I am not a Biblical scholar, but not totally illiterate either. From what I have observed since becoming a Christian, there seem to be as many opinions about the Rapture as there are people all of them claim certain passages in the Bible to backup their viewpoint pre-tribulation, post, not at all. I did enjoy this movie to a point but, as I do with most any film, book or personal opinion, I took it with a grain of salt. It merely depicts an interpretation an educated guess by someone with a pre-tribulation view. Whatever actually takes place should be an interesting topic of discussion and study, but not a point of division. As for me, my beliefs are simple. I am assured that I am saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ. When He returns - as He has promised and as the final prophecy reveals He will I have complete faith that I will know Him - because I already do.
