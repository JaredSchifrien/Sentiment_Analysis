I have heard that THE WIZARD OF OZ is the most watched American movie ever made. It is, indeed, an excellent movie and I can understand why it has earned such a reputation. It appeals to the sensibility of everyone, basically. It is probably the greatest family film ever made. I remember watching this movie when I was younger. While not one of my top favorites, THE WIZARD OF OZ is an extremely entertaining movie and it deserves every bit of praise it has gotten.
