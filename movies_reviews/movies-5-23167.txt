this movie is one of few that ive watched 4 times in 3 days. but thats not just because you have to watch this movie more than once to understand it. its because its so intrigueing and so creative that it just blew me away. Donnie Darko is the first movie ive ever seen that combines sci-fi, horror, comedy, suspense and mystery in one movie.
