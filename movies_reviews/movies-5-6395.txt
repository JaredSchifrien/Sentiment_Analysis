This John Ford movie should be much further up the list! John Wayne is a misfit and a loner on a quest to rescue his neice who was stolen by the Indians. Why does Wayne's character really want to find her? Duke is more of an anti-hero than hero here. The last scene is terrific--wind it back and watch it again.
