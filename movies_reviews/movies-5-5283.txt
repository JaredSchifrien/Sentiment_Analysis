this is one oif the most amazing films ever made. A true cinematic tour de force. One can watch this film with a sense of wonder throughout all the facets of their life. As a kid you watch for the magic and cartoonish horror, and later as an adult you can watch it while high or drunk(i prefer drunk) and the feeling is the same. In fact I believe that the Wizard of Oz was created by seedy 1930's hollywood drug abusers for their personal enhancement.
