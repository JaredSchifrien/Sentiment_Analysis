 El Mariachi intrigues me...in some ways it seems cheap and hokey, like a homemade video, but it still mesmerizes me with its portrayal of gangland border drug culture that smashes headlong into the life of an innocent young mariachi who wants nothing more than to be allowed to play his guitar and sing... Definitely an entertaining flick!
