Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise did an excellent job acting in this film. The movie really pulled me into their lives. I really enjoyed how they put their gifts to good use and made some money in Vegas. The dialogue was great, and how Mr. Hoffman didn't end up with a speech impediment after the film was finished is surprising. Yeah, K-Mart, 400 Oak St....
