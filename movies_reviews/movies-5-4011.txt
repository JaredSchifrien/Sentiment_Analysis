The first time I watched this movie, I really didn't care much for it. But I have seen it several times since then, and I really love it. The message of the movie is great, too. I love almost all of the characters, except that whiny Marlin, but even then his annoying character doesn't ruin the movie for me. Ellen DeGeneres did an astounding job as Dory...I highly recommend it for families everywhere, and even single people ! This is not just a children's movie...
