Hoosiers is one of the best sports movies of all time. Based on a true story, it shows what can be accomplished if you work hard and believe in yourself and those around you. If it weren't based on a true story, you would almost think it is too unbelievable. Yet, that is what makes it so special. The actor who plays star player Jimmy Chitwood is great. Through very few words, he portrays the embodiment of the hopes of Indiana basketball. Gene Hackman and Dennis Hopper are perfectly cast, as well. If you're looking to get pumped up before a big game, big night out, or an important meeting or interview, Hoosiers is the perfect choice.
