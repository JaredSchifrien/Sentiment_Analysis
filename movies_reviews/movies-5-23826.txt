it's been said before, but either you love it or you hate it. most people will hate it. i love it. (i'm different, lucky me!). just see it, and make up your own mind. or, if you need another opinion to decide on whether a movie is good or not, try this one: i didn't get all the face-stretching stuff, or the weird costumes, and the message was like, weird, and heavy. it's orwell made light, if there is such a thing. gilliam's struggle to get it made is a story in itself. maybe it made more sense under reagan, but it's still a triumph of art over fascism (albeit a pyrean one) and it's therefore relevant. it's also pretty entertaining. not a comedy, though, as it tries to be. be warned.
