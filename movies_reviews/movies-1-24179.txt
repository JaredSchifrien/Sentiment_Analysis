What a dumb movie! Another piece of bad entertainment from Jerry Bruckheimer. This film is loud, dumb, and full of special effects; no one with half a brain would believe the plot of sending oil drills into space to blow up an asteroid. Filled with cliche's too, from the quirky comic relief characters to the self-sacrifice of Bruce Willis at the end. A poor excuse to show an expensive CGI scene of Paris blowing up.
