I was watching this movie at home. It was recommended to me so I gave it a chance. I think it is the most horrible, tasteless movie I have seen in a long time. The humour was just way over the top and it just left me with a sick feeling inside. I had to stop watching it once I realized it just wasn't getting any better. I consider myself to have a good sense of humour but this movie is just wrong. Now that we have gone this far in movies, it's hard to go back to anything that is pure and good. It's all about one shocking extreme to the next. I hate to see what it store for our next generation of movie goers. I don't recommend this movie.
