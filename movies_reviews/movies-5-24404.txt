i saw this here movie just last night at one of them there dollar theaturs in my town and i got to say i think it was just a great movie. i am a big big fan of david duchovny so i was real excited to see him in this movie. and it is so funny. and it is just real intennse. and i liked it so much and cant even wate to get this movie on video. i aslo liked the make 7up yours guy that was in the movie. the aliens were kind of scarey but not nearly as scarey as the ones i seen in real life back in 98.
