A brilliant Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece. Dynamite script. Hooks the viewer from Bernard Hermann's excellent opening strings. Norman Bates is not just a one dimensional psycho, he's complicated, vulnerable, and the viewer almost feels sorry for him. Fantastic performance by Anthony Perkins. Marion Crane(played wonderfully by Janet Leigh) is not just an innocent victim either, the fact that she's embezzeling money makes it even better. The famous shower scene, no matter how many times one watches this movie, it still manages to shock. The scene where Martin Arbogast is murdered is actually more heart pounding, a testament to Hitchcock's genius. A classic thriller/horror that many others don't even compare to.
