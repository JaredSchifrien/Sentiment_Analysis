Perhaps the greatest and most realistic war movie ever filmed. The opening scene portraying the D-Day invasion was so real and so overwhelming that many WWII veterans had to leave the theater. It concerned the political as well as the social parts of war. Very historical and amazing. Despite showing intense violence, it was still a stern drama.
