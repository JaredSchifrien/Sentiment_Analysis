Great music movie! It includes everthing, adventure, romance and some tragedy. This is a complete movie with fine songs that are unforgettable, I do somtimes sing "So Long, Farewell" when it is a formal parting. Truly one great true story with a lot of realism- I couldn't tell if the background hills are really a backdrop of Austria or just made up. One of the best movies these actors participated in. (Esp. for Julie Andrews, this should be the best.)
