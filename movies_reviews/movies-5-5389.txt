If there was a rating higher than 5, I would give it. People need to look past the mistaken idea that this is a Christmas movie and see that it is a movie that can be viewed all through the year...and with every viewing you get something new. It just grabs your heart. James Stewart, as far as I am concerned, was the greatest actor Hollywood has produced. He is sheer brilliance in this movie. To watch him fall apart is to see what happens to many people in dire straits. You live it with him. When he realizes just how blessed he is, you share that joy with him too. I think, of all the movies Mr. Stewart did, this is the one that he will be remembered for 100 years from now. And they will still be remarking on the brilliance of the film and the performances. While he is by far the best thing about the movie, that is not to say that the others were less than wonderful. The whole cast was astoundingly fabulous. As you can see, this IS my favorite movie. Mr. Stewart made this film just after he returned from service in WWII. With everything he lived through during the war, it is a mature Jimmy we see. As loved as George Bailey was, Jimmy is even more loved. I just wish the people of that time realized the quality of the film. I am glad they do now.
