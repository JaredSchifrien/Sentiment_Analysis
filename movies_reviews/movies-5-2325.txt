I loved this one. It is my all time favorite movie. The whole plot was kick ass! The Mummy's CG effects were very tyght! He looked like a real Pharoh later once he regenerated. Imhotep is my favorite villian and in this one he was evil and cool in the second one he came off as a tad on the wimpy side. In this one the story was so tyght. The characters are very likeable and cool even the villians. The Egyptian was as great as it gets. I think that Imhotep's relationship with Anck-su-namun should have been kept like this instead of her leaving him to die. Great movie check it out some time it won't disappoint
