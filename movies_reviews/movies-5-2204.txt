Great movie based on a great book. Unfortunatly like with almost all other movies based on books, there just isn't enough time to fit in all the specifics. In actuality Dantes goes to much greater lengths to obtain his revenge. However, the director did a good job of not making the movie too long which could risk losing the interest of those who weren't familiar with the story.
