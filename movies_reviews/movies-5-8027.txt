Excellent movie. My Big Fat Greek Wedding is something fresh and original after endless lines of mindless romantic comedies. It shows the truth about love, it isn't always pretty, it isn't always easy, and sometimes you have to make comprimises but in the end it can happen if you work at it. The jokes are actually funny and the characters are real and lovable. The acting was terrifically well done, especially for a low budget independant meant for limited release. This was a highly enjoyable film, and if you're in the mood for something cute and lighthearted, this is what I would recommend.
