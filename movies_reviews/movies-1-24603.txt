The original planet of the apes was pretty darn good!.. the new one ( tim burton), was HORRIBLE! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS TRASH. I wasnt that impressed with the ape costumes either, especially the female apes. The movie ( plot, actors) itself is unwatchable. I was shocked that a human actually made this crappy film.
