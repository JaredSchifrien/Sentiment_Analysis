Most movies Tom Hanks is in are great. This was outstanding. Possibly not so much for his acting, per se, but the reality of the movie. It pretty much showed what would happen if someone was stranded on a deserted island. Gilligan's Island it wasn't. I enjoyed the movie and the realism portrayed. I can also see how even a volley ball could become one's best friend in such a situation. (I'll bet the Wilson company paid a lot for that one, eh? Not quite as much as Fed Ex did though)
