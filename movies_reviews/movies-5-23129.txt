David Bowie is HOT as the goblin king, Jarreth. I was a little girl when the movie came out and now my little girl loves it as much as I do. Jennifer Connley was great as the big sister who wishes her brother away and then goes on a journey to save him from becoming a goblin. I love the music and the overall look of the movie is beautiful.
