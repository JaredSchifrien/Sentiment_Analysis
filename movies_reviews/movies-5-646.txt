Kubrick almost never misses, and hit his target again in this one. It's about how human beings are transformed into killers. Some learn the lesson a little TOO well, as we see at the end of the first half. The second half shows the results of the transformation. FMJ is a rich and powerful anti-war statement: it amuses me to no end that the right-wingers on here completely missed the point.
