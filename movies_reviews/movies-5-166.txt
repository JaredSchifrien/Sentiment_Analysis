This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Mel's performace is top notch here and the cinematography is breath taking. I agree that the battle scenes are spectacular and broke new ground. I want to add that the score to this film gives me goose bumps. It fits perfectly well with the scenes or just wonderfully as stand alone compositions. The music is just riveting. Mel did a heck of a job telling this story.
