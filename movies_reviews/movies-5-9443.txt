 Tootsie is one of the best comedy movies ever made. Unable to find acting work, Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) disguises himself as a woman and is hired to work on a soap opera as Dorothy Michaels, a hospital administrator. What follows is a series of absolutely hilarious events based on the deception. Hoffman is forced to deal with women's things, such as building a wardrobe, applying make-up, dieting, dealing with chauvinistic bosses, etc., and he also has to fend off the advances of various admirers. A particularly funny scene takes place when John Van Horn, one of Dorothy's co-workers, serenades her outside her apartment building. A flustered Dorothy is forced to invite him in, and what follows is a riotously funny scene in which Bill Murray (Michael/Dorothy's roommate) confronts the would-be suitor. Even though I've seen Tootsie so many times I've lost count, I never fail to enjoy it thoroughly.
