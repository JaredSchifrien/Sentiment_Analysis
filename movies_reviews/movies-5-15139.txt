Talk about a movie that absolutely tears your heart out. I was a kid when this movie came out and I didn't know much about divorce because my folks were married, but Kramer vs. Kramer really moved me. The performances across the board were absolutely super. Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep were both great, but it was the performance by Justin Henry (he played the kid) that was most impressive. The scenes with him and Hoffman were so memorable, particularly the one towards the end of the movie as they discuss where he will be living. If you haven't seen this film, check it out and be sure that you have some tissues.
