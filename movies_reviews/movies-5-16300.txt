I thought this film was very beautifully filmed, very simplistic and very, very good. As some of you may know, I'm not a religious person, but I did appreciate this film. To anyone who thinks that subtitles are distracting - you are missing out on a wealth of fantastic foreign films, unless you can withstand disgustingly bad dubbing with horrible voiceovers. I think one of the reasons why I like this film is because it wasn't screaming at people to believe in Jesus and God. It was just simply saying 'this is what this man suffered and he took it on'. It could have been rounded out a bit better, but the essence of the story is there. The scenes of him being whipped and nailed to the cross were convincing and certainly made me wince. Hats off to Mel Gibson, he could have gone over-the-top and made it longer than 2 hours and far more intense, but he kept it in line and I definately do not regret having this in my DVD collection.
