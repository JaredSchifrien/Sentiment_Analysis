This movie shocked me to no end- firstly because its in-depth, graphic look in the far-reaching use of drugs in America and secondly because the acting was incredible. By far one of the most depressing films ever but obviously the point of this film is not to entertain. It is an unconventional, disturbing piece meant to cause you to think. This film dragged me through so many emotions from disgust to empathy to nausea to extreme sadness. It is clearly not a mvie for the faint of heart as the depiction of these character's lives is relentless and painful. But its acting is magnificent and its storyline touches a deep chord in the heart.
