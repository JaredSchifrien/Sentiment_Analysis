Now this is a movie. A young boy named Bastian, being chased by bullies hides in a book store, there he discovers a magical book called The Neverending Story. Bastian takes the book and hides in his schools attic and begins to read it. You experience the story along with him. There is too much to mention. A princess, a luck dragon, a giant turtle named Morla and that's just the begining. A great story with a wonderful ending, very imaginative. Kids and adults of all ages will like this movie even the music is enjoyable. Great special effects and costumes.
