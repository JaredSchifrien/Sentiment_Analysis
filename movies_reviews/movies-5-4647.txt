An enchanting,inspired claymation Oscar-winning classic from the brilliant British animator Nick Park.The best of the marvellous adventures of Wallace and Gromit(the immensely likeable owner and dog)- this time involving a pair of mechanical trousers and a villainous museum-robbing penguin who lodges at their home!Equally appealing for adults and children,and a must-see for anyone unfamiliar with the delightful series.
