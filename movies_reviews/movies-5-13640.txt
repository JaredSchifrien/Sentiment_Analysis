Wow. Edward Norton is one of the best actors of all time! He gets better with every movie he does! God I love that guy. Anyway, the movie is fantastic. I loved how all the performers made ALL the charcters seem real. This movie shows you how hard life can be. It shows you everything until it is sure you understand what they're trying to convey.
