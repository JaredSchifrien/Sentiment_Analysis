This review is for the DVD directors cut edition. Yes, it's a good movie. Nicholas Meyer who directed this sequel wanted to give the movie a naval feel and it works well. James Horner's score reinforces that nautical feel, notably when the Enterprise is clearing the moorings. The movie flows well, and with the possible exception of the Genesis Cave the effects are great. This director cuts adds some scenes and dialog, notably we discover Scotty's nephew is a crew member aboard the ship. William Shatner's portrayal of Kirk is probably one his best performances (if you listen to the DVD commentary, director Meyer discusses he would make Shatner do each take about 10 times so he'd lose the Hollywood swagger). With the loss of Spock however the movie does end on a somber note. But this is still one of the best Trek movies to grace the screen.
