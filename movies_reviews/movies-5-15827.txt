Not knowing what to expect from a movie on such a touchy and difficult subject matter (having read a little of the Marquis' writings) I have to admit I was both impressed and enthralled. This is not a boring movie and the acting for the most part is wonderful. I recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor and not easily offended. I would like to add I saw this movie feeling depressed after a bad week. Amazingly I left the theatre feeling uplifted and better about many things. I am NOT going to analyze that too deeply! Just go see it. Fall into the story, color, language and costumes Enjoy!
