I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, myself. It's an action flick that obviously doesn't take itself too seriously. Some of the dialogue in it is hysterical, and there's even a bit of a history lesson, if you're paying attention. This movie reminded my of the Indiana Jones movies, which I also enjoyed. A good clean action flick for the whole family, IMHO
