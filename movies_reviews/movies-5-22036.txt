THIS is THE ultimate movie in sci-fi action, the best of the the whole alien series. this one was so good it there was really no need to make anymore.(regrettable they did) i can't help but feel alien3 and ressurection are separate stories from the first two. despite fellow canadian james cameron's success with titanic this is my favorite of his films(just barley beating out T2) in my opinion cameron should have done alien3 even though it wasn't necessary to be made.
