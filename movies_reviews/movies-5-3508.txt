I was really looking forward to seeing this movie and my expectations were unmistakingly rewarded. Although I would have liked to have seen more races, what lacked in action made up for in cars, wow I saw some amazing machines esspecially the one that Paul Walker's character drives (the bright green beauty) that is eventually destroyed by a very convincing enemy johnny. The plot was a little slow and the ending was not what I hoped, but again Vin Diesel made up for that. I don't believe the director could have chosen a better king of the road. I'm really looking forward to the sequel.
