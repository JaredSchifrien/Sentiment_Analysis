This is the best movie I've seen in a while. It was very entertaining because it was humorous in a corny kind of way. I loved it's entire aspect and it was very trippy. In addition, I had an idea to film a movie where the camera person was the star of the flick. This movie did that for a couple of scenes. Great idea!
