One of the worst movies I've seen this year. Pathetic. Weak story, weak script, dull characters even though Rufus Sewell is pretty convincing: he was so hateful I wanted to strangle him. Anyway, the SFX are ridiculous, I laughed out loud. It isn't scary at all....sometimes the little girl was quite cool, but it's not enough.
