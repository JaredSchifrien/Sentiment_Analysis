 I think people went to see this movie expecting too much. This is not ment to be deep in any respect. It is a funny warped look at the 80's yuppie life style. I found this movie to be a well made masterpeice of the strange and macabre. It was interesting how greed and materialism can make you completely disconnected from those around you to the point of homicide. This film is ment to be taken as a very dark very tounge in cheek comedy. I thought the threesome scene with Sussudio playing in the background was classic. My friends and I laughed about that all night and is to this day a great source of amusement and an inside joke. If it is deep at all it succeds in showing how deep the depths of shallowness are. I am a fan of the book and an even greater fan of the movie. Christian Bale was perfect for the role and did a masterful job at what he did. I highly recommend it for its brilliant humor. Deffinatly a movie for those with a taste for morbid humor.
