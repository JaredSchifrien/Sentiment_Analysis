If you've ever worked (been stuck) in an office/cubical job then this movie is for YOU. If you hate your job, if you fantasize about coming in one day and not giving a damn, blowing off your boss, even burning your whole place of employment down, than watch this movie. It's very theraputic for those of us wishing we didn't have to suffer thru WORK. (Anyone who doesn't like this movie obviously hasn't suffered at work enough!)
