Another very over rated movie, Lili Dolly and Jane. This was Dolly's first feature and she was the best two parts of the movie. I have never found Lili to be all that funny and Jane well Jane is never funny. Dabney Coleman suffers through the abuse that the ladies force upon him and the movies brings some short lived life to his carier. Good vehicle to get Dolly started up other then that it was a bust! Ouch.
