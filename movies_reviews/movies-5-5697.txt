one of the better made movies. Just as great today as years ago. I saw this at first as a teenager and so did my daughter. The movie is a bit different from the book but it is well cast with Vivian Leigh as Scarlett, and Clark Gable as Rhett.A very long movie if you have a good four hours to spare but worth it. Well done in every way.
