No offense... but I thought this was really stupid. The whole plot was pretty pathetic, and the acting wasn't good either. I see it has lots of really good reviews.. I just can't really believe that. Correct me if I'm wrong--this is the one where a girl goes back in time to find a dinosaur egg, or something like that? It was really bad.
