When this first came out I did not want to see it. I though, I know what happends anyway, people go on ship, ship sinks, people die. Plus I hate that leonardo dicaprio While that was tragic, I didn't think is should be a movie. So it wasn't until it was released again in the theaters that I was finally draged to go see it. I can honestly say I'm glad I saw it on the big sceen. The story was superb, the acting was superb(even leonardo dicaprio),and the music went very well with each part of the movie. The directing and set was the best i've ever seen, it makes you feel like your there, the feel of the movie is so well portraid that each character, even small roles are a integral part in this flim. I can go on and on about the magnificent directing and charcter development, but the only way anyone can understand is if they see it for themselves.
