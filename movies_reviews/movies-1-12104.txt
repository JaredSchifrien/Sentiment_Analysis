Boy, did I make a mistake renting this movie. I should have known better after reading the recommendation on the back of the movie box that suggested I'd like Nurse Betty. (I walked out of the theater during Nurse Betty. ) Anyway, I like Steve Martin, and I thought Novocaine looked like an enjoyable dark comedy. I have three major complaints about the show. First, the plot got off to a pretty good start, but it never went anywhere. In addition, the actions of Steve Martin's character were totally unbelievable, in my opinion, and I found myself grumbling about that to my husband throughout the show. Finally, the movie is pretty disturbing, and I have pictures in my mind I'd rather not have, as a result. Don't even think about wasting your time on this one.
