My advice - do not rent, buy or even waste your time watching this thing with friends. Unless, of course, you're in the mood to make fun of something that will barely challenge your skills in sarcasm. It is by far the most inane but successful waste of celluloid I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing. As much as I hate to admit it, I bought a $6.00 bargain copy - suckered in by my own curiosity and the cagey promotional stunt as seen on the Sci-Fi channel. Sci-Fi's promotional documentary , while very shrewd and effective, was still basically a big fat lie. Still, it was more cleverly done and coherently put together than the actual film. I completely agree with Molfan - 90 minutes of your life you will never get back.
