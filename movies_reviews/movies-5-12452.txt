If you are easily offended by rap music and don't like to hear a lot of swaring this movie is probably not for you. On the other hand, if you want a rough, uncompromising look at prostitution and breaking into the music industry this movie just might be for you. This is not the story where the poor boy makes it rich because he's a nice guy who simply gave it a shot. Instead its a gritty glimpse of a profession that, while glamorized in today's pop culture, is shown to be dirty and entrapping. It turns out there might be people in this business with emotions and self-asteem, despite the tremendous stresses they experience. If you want a rare story-driven movie, about a subject not often dealt with, give this one a try, but I don't think you can give it a very objective evaluation if it conflicts with your own values and lifestyle.
