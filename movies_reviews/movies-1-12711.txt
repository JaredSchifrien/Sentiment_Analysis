Everyone who rated this movie as great must really be truly blind. Shroomwoman is exactly correct. In the movie, Mr. Moore expresses how he cares for the victims of Columbine. About how scary the whole incident was. Mr. Moore made millions of dollars from this documentary. And how much do you think went to the poor victims of this terrible tragedy? $0. Suprised? Shouldn't be. Especially when he balmes all wealthy and rich people in America for the poor people's problems. Yet, he was the man who made millions and didn't give a single dime of it to anyone but himself. God, I hate hypocrisy. Anyway, this film, if you can really call it that, is nothing but Moore's own opinion mixed together with political views. And lies, of course. Mr. Moore visits a weapons of mass destruction facility as it is described in the film. In reality, it was not making any weapons, but satellites. He compares US gun violence to the gun violence in Australia, as well as other countries. About how Australia only has a few hundred vioent crimes while the US has thousands. Yet, then, you ask yourself, what is the population of Australia vs. teh US? LOL! Its little pieces and bits if information and facts that are left out of the movie. Just like the timeline of the US, that blames America for 9-11. That's right. Watch the movie and feel the disgrace in your stomach. I did. Mr. Moore is just a filthy liar, who is trying to brainwash you into believing his lies. Don't fall for him. Everyone who supports this film is an idiot and a tool.
