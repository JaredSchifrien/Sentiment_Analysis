This just may be the funniest movie ever made. No matter how many times I watch it, the jokes never get old or warned out. Some may not be fond of British humor (which is just an outright nonsense insanity rollercoaster). If you are, prepare for the funniest 90 minute to two hours you'll ever sit through. Every cast member of Monty Python is in top form.
