After the disappointing first feature, Spider-Man 2 comes along and smashes all expectations of it by being almost as great as it can be. As a sequel, its like The Wrath of Khan to Star Trek's Motion Picture. The special effects in the movie's creatively-inspired action sequences simply have to be seen to believed. There is also lots of great humor--running gags and references to both other Marvel comics and the original Spider-Man TV series. Kirsten Dunst is absoultely beautiful as Mary Jane Watson. And, the actor playing J. Johna Jameson has his character down perfect (and has one of the funniest sequences of the film). There's is also a great speech from Aunt May about how the world needs heroes and good guys. The cliffhanger ending guarentees a sequel, and the ending on a whole is much more optimistic and upbeat than the ending of the first film. In short, Spider-Man 2 is an incredible cinematic achievement.
