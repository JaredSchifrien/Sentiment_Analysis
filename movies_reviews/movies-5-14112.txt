This is basically the only film where I can actually watch Jim Carrey - he's being an actor instead of a cartoon character and he pulls it off really well. The whole point of this film is to question just how much the media influences and controls us from day to day - to the extent that a media company adopts a baby and creates a false world for him and everyone in his life, friends, family and even his wife, are actors. It reflects how we get sucked into shows and believe the characters to be real. The plot is good with Truman realising that the world he is living in is false and he breaks free. This is a heartwarming film and definately teh best role of Jim Carey's career.
