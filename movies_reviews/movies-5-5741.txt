Teppi Hedren is an insufferable airhead. Jessica Tandy looks, well, Overly paranoid. Also stars a very young Veronica Cartwright, who gets some of the best lines in this offbeat movie. Great visuals and sound design, with no score to speak of, although a children's song and timely editing is used to great effect. Not Overly scary, slow at first, but very fun to watch from the point that Tippy Tippi gets her head drilled by a seagull.
