Jack Nicholson was hilarious as a fiction writer with multiple mental poblems. He and Helen Hunt had a special chemistry that I haven't seen in a long time- despite their age difference. When I saw it in the theater, everybody raved about it. I could feel how much the character played by him loved her son.
