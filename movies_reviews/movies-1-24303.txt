Well, plot has never exactly been a strength with this series. The special effects were decent, but the plot was totally ludicrous, and the acting was bad, too. There's 2 sequences you can laugh at though. One is on the plane there, where Sam Neill dreams that a raptor is talking to him. A second is when they find the cellphone in a huge pile of dinosaur turds, and suddenly a ceratosaur runs up and JUST looks at them before ambling off. Otherwise, it's awful.
