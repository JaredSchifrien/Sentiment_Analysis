Roger Rabbit, a cartoon character, is framed for the murder of a live-action human. This movie is a combination of live-action and animation and a mix of Disney and Warner Bros. animated co-stars and cameos (the fight between Daffy Duck and Donald Duck is not to be missed). Live action and animation interact a LOT more than ANY other movie made, including Phantom Menace.
