James Cagney really shows his acting chops in this movie about George M Cohan. An entertaining musical and Cagney really puts his all into it. He's touching, delightful and electryfing. Walter Huston is great as his father Jerry. Cagney won an Academy Award for his performance. The movie will not disappoint.
