 Wonderful! One of the holy satan trilogy. The Exorcist,Rosemary's Baby and then...The Omen. If this movie isn't creepy I don't know what is. Just seeing good people die horrible deathsa is scary in and of itself. But the idea of God foresaking us and leaving us to die by the hands of Damien, the anti-christ, is the frightning part. True horror fans should all have this on the list. This film is darling and I hold it close to my heart. I will name my first born Damien and marry a girl named Rosemary and have a house keeper named Reagan to make Damien split pea soup for lunch. Lame joke I know. Sorry.
