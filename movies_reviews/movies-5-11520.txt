I enjoyed American Pie 2. The sequel to this teenage comedy, seemed to have more heart than the first one, where everything was about teenagers and their wild adventures. Don't get me wrong, the sequel had the same expected humour impact, but a bit more sensitive. If you thought you got to know the characters really well in the previous movie, this one actually goes deeper into their true feelings and exhibits their emotions at a better level conclusive level. By the end of the film you know that American Pie 2 provided a close to all characters and relationships, therefore making it very hard for a next sequel. Overall, I was pretty satisfied, and even surprised with the outcome of American Pie 2, since I had much lower expectations from it.
