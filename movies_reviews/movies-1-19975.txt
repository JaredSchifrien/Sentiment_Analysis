Worst horror film ever made, hands down. When a horror movie relies only on CGI computer animation for chills, it is a failure. Computer based images are not scary, because they are transparent and incredibly obviouse. That and the script sucked. The only true horrorfying moments in this movie came from the sh*t dialouge and the idea that a major studio would pump out such garbage that has no redeeming quality. I will never forgive the creators of this film for calling it a horror movie. This is pre packaged cotton candy bull sh*t for the brain dead.
