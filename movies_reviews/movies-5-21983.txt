My favorite film of all time. Rob Reiner shows his genius in this fantasy film about a poor farmboy named Wesley who falls in love with a girl named Buttercup. The story is filled with love, romance, comedy, action and suspense. I feel it is something that can appeal to all audiences. In addition it supports a huge Hollywood cast, including Cary Elwes, Robin Wright Penn, Mandy Patinkin, Andre the Giant, and cameos by Billy Crystal and Carol Kane. This is one of the greatest films ever made in my opinion.
