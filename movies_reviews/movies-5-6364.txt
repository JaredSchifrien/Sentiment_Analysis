Broderick Crawford's tour de force as an idealistic politician gone corrupt, ruthless and power-mad. Based on the life of Huey Long, one-time governor, senator and unofficial military dictator of Louisiana. Crawford deserved his Oscar. Notable supporting performance by Mercedes McCambridge as Crawford's campaign aide/jilted lover.
