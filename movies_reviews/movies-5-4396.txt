Shrek and Fiona are back in this hysterical sequel to the amazing first film. Here's the plot: Shrek (voiced by the absolutley wonderful by Mike Myers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz) get back from their fantasy honeymoon to find that they are invited to meet Fiona's mom and dad, who turn out to be the King and Queen of a hoity-toity kingdom, appropriately named Far Far Away. I'll let you figure out the rest. With genius voices from Myers, Diaz, Eddie Murphy (the irresistible Donkey) and Antonio Banderas (as a gut-busting-funny assasin kitty-cat) and a chuckle every five seconds, this is a summer movie that you MUST see.
