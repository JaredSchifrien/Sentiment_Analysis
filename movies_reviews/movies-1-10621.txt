It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, cause that was the Norwegian film Dis , but I'm quite sure it's the worst 1999-film probably the worst comedy in the 90ies! If there was an Oscar for Worst Actress, Julia Roberts would certainly get it! In 1990ies we aren't satisfied with voiceless boring movies with no action! :-(
