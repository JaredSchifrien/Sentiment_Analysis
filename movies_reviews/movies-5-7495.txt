Best legal comedy ever! Two scenes come to mind imediately when you mention this film to me. Scene one: in the cafe, Vinny picks up the menu. Shows the menu to his girlfriend: 'so what do you think, breakfast?' 'Breakfast sounds good.' Then they show you the menu, with three things on it; breakfast, lunch, dinner. Scene two: in the court room, Vinny is crossing a witness. 'Isn't it possible that the two yout's...' 'Say what?' 'Excuse me your honor' 'What was that word?' 'What?' 'Did you say youts?' 'Yeah.' 'What is a yout?' 'Oh, pardon me your honor, two youthssssss.'
