Hey! I loves this movie! I have no idea why really because it's not like I want to be a musician when I grow up, but I do love music! Maybe it's the idea a punk GIRL group instead of all these punk BOY groups. I also like lepoard print! There's just something about this movie that really makes me think It's da bomb! . I know my mom doesn't agree with me but who cares. She's a grown up! I'm a kid, so I have a right to like it! That's all! C ya later!
