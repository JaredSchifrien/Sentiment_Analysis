I just saw this movie and I must say, while not perfect, it was excellent. I have noticed reviews in the politically correct media cut on this movie and rate it low because it shows the first two years of the American Civil War from the Confederate point of view. It is sad, and upsetting, to hear so-called critics hop on the race bandwagon because they think it will grant them brownie points from African-Americans. They try making the point that this film was biased toward the Southern point of view because it showed Rebel soldiers going off to war saying they were fighting for their homes and jobs, instead of slavery. Now, as a professional historian, I would ask these same critics to use a little common sense. After deep, unbiased thought, does one really think that millions of Southern soldiers fought for, and 250,000 died, defending slavery. Most of these soldiers were poor farm boys who were little better than slaves themselves. While I would agree that many of the leaders of the Confederacy were planters and slave holders and led the South into the war for that reason, the majority of the soldiery fought because they were invaded. That is fact. This was basically a movie about Stonewall Jackson, a facinating man and an oustanding, hard hitting warrior. His life, along with Lee's and the Army of Northern Virginia is a terrific story that needs to be told to today's race paranoid populace. They need to understand the point of view of many of the Southern soldiers. It's a big part of our countries history. Modern America needs to learn more about the excellent campaigns that were fought by Lee and Jackson in 1862 and 1863, when they were the terrors of the Union. Apparently, even our most learned critics need reminding.
