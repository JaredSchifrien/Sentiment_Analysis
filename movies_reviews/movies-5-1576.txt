Incredibly well made. Geffory Rush and Johnny Deep are both subperb in this. The story is interesting and isn't predictable and the special effect were awesome. (I could go on at how great this movie was or what was great about it but that would take all night!) One of the greatest movies of all time. Definatly up there with Star War and Raiders of The Lost Ark.
