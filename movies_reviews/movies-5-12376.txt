Saw this today! It was great. Entertaining, warm and a pleasure to not be distracted from the film by better known child actors...a wonderful movie. Kamy: Found this re: cat with spectacles on a blog: "Maybe it was the crayoned marking that Edmund did when he went into the witch's house earlier on. Did anyone notice that he was painting a mustache onto one of the stone statues? It looked like he had grabbed black charcoal, but it could have been another color. I wasn't sure if it was a cat, but I will make sure I pay close attention when I go back to see the movie, on both points, because I didn't see what you're referring to."
