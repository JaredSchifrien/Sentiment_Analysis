One of the few films I've walked out on early on in the film. In one of the opening scenes it shows the effects of a would-be plane crash...I turned to my friend and stated "It looks like a movie set," to which he laughed in agreement. Then we see a victim from the crash laying there supposedly dead, but who doesn't even look real...So at that point we decided it was either leaving the theatre or falling asleep - we left.
