great film. pitt really delivers. a bit much of the ritchie trademark back-and-forth you're stupid no, you are type dialogue- i got enough of that in 'lock, stock...' but this was a better film. full of surprises, attitude, violence (the key to any great movie) and twists. must see, a real thrill ride. shades of 'the sting' and 'rocky', with a dash of 'the french connection'.
