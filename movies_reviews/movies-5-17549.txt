Eisenstein near his best in a brilliant, brutal film. Using the saga of the Teutonic Knights campaign against the Russians in the middle ages, Eisenstein draws a parallell with the rising threat of Nazi Germany. The helmeted, faceless knights, the sturdy, sometimes comedic Russian soldiers, the horrific burning babies scene and the final denouement on the ice are unforgettable bits of cinema. Add to that an unforgettable score by Prokoviev, and what exists is a work of art.
