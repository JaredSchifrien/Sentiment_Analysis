She had me feeling bad for her right up to the point when she cheated on her husband. WTF was that? Her husband LOVED her so much and cared for her, and that is her thanks -- she cheats on him with that freak? Sorry -- that ruined the movie -- it would have been GREAT and a REAL tearjerker even for guys like me -- until that SH#T. Before all you over-analyzers get on my case about the fact she wanted to experience life and all that -- and she only made love to her husband before -- shut it! Just because she is dying does not make it right --
