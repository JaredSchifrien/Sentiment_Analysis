If you want to see a great movie, this is certainly one. I know a lot of people have an aversion to reading subtitles, but this is one time when you shouldn't let that bother you. This is a completely captivating film, and it's considered by many to be even better than the Disney version. I'm a little undecided on that, but it's a very close race. Rent this one (if you can find it) and you'll be glad you did, just give it a chance.
