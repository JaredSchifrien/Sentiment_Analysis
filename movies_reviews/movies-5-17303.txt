This is one of the finest movies I have ever seen. Set around the most horific tragedy in history, it is a love story first between a man and a woman, and then between the man and his son. So many scenes tug at your heart while you're also laughing. With sub-titles, it may difficult to follow on the small screen, but is definitely worth the effort.
