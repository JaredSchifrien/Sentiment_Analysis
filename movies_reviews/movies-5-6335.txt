Wonderful, wonderful movie. It tells the story of 3 war vets who meet by chance on their return home. They all live in the same city, and you get to see how their lives continue and all the heartaches they have to overcome. This is a movie everyone should see at least once. It surely shows that once a man has been to war, things will never be the same again for him.
