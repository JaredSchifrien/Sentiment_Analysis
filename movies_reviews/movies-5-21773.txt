Of all the LOTR movies, I wouold have to say this one is my favorite. If I can sit through this movies 5 times and not get tired of it, you know I must love it. And it's not just because of Orlando's eye shot closeup in Fangorn Forest. Although that did keep me on the edge of my seat for about 5 minutes afterwards.( That was when I was obsessed with him, which I'm not anymore by the way) This one definetly has the best battle scene. The batle at Helms Deep is amazingly crafted. It took them a long time to build that set. I think they said about 7 months. And then it gets destroyed! Talk about hard work gone before your eyes! But it's all worth it. My favorite 2 lines from the battle scene. 1st, from Legolas talking to Gimli when he can't see. GimliWhat's happening? LegolasShall I describe it to you, or would you like me to find you a box?. My second favorite, again from Gimli and Legolas. When their fighting the Orcs and such, Gimli Leoglas! Two already! Leoglas I'm on 17! Gimli Argh! I'll have no pointy ear outscoring me! Legolas19! It's hilarious! Ya, I know, I'm a die-hard fan!
