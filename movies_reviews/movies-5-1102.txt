All a man has in this world is his balls and his word, and I don't break'em for no one. You got that?I don't even remember how many times I've quoted from this movie, since I saw it, about 10 years ago. Pacino's performance is something else,it is not acting,it's simply art in it's most amazing form.definitely in my top 5.
