All flash, no substance. Looks like the pervert wanted his set fantasies acted out in front of him and then decided to write a plot around the scenes. The film could've been profound but instead it ws superficial, poorly put together, and basically the epitome of the TRASH that is churned out by Hollywood presently. It's sickening.
