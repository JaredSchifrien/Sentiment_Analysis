THE ADAPTATION FROM BOOK TO FILM ON THE SERIES APPEARS TO BE A SUCCESS. THE FIRST FILM WHICH CENTERED ON MOSTLY A FEW CHARACTERS WAS BETTER ACCEPTED BY ME PERSONALLY THAN THE SECOND WHICH INTRODUCED US TO MANY MORE CREATURES AND PERSONALITIES. IT IS MY DESIRE TO SEE ART IMITATE LIFE AND SO ONE MUST WONDER WAS THERE NOT A BROWN SKINNED HUMAN, ELF, DWARF, OR HOBBIT IN THE WHOLE OF MIDDLE EARTH, AND THOUGH JR TOLKIEN DIDN'T MENTION IF I REMEMBER IN READING ANY PIGMENTATION BESIDES THAT ATRIBUTED TO THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE IMAGINARY RACES. ONE MUST WONDER HOW A FILM OF SUCH EPIC PORPORTIONS THAT MUST TOUCH SO MANY IMAGINATIONS WOULD BE MADE WITHOUT AN AFRO-AMERICAN ACTOR IN OBVIOUS SITE, OR MAYBE IT'S SURON, THE RULLER OF MORDOR.
