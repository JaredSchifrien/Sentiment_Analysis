the same people who rate 'scary movie' the greatest of all time, rate this movie terrible (i doubt if they have even seen it)....glad i am not in with this bunch....stephen boyd (does anyone remember he also starred on 'fantastic voyage' (anyone see this?)is absolutely excellent... another top rate performance by charlton heston, good writing, direction, score....have seen about 8 times...
