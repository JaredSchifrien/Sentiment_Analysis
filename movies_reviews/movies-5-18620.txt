This movie is simply amazing! A very exciting plot with a shocking twist at the end. Nicole Kidman gives a wonderful, brilliant performance, as do the two children, and everyone else in the movie. The candlelight setting and the music add to the suspense. I highly reccomend this thrilling movie. I just want to watch it again and again!
