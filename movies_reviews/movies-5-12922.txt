As much as i do not like Tim Robbins i must say that this is the masterpiece of his career so far. This movies could have been another jail-break film but Tim and Morgan Freeman ( and the rest of the cast of inmates and officers) carry the weight of the drama with deep passion to the point in which you actually feel pity for the prision men. The scene where Tim finally reaches freedom is a powerfull and memorable one and the kind you have to rewind over and over.
