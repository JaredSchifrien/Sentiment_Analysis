I have to disagree with Obsidian's assessment. Yes, the story is a cliche, but there are very few original plots; most are different ways of telling a familiar story. Yes, the movie has no depth -- but I don't think it ever intended to be or to be seen as a deep, thought-provoking, meaningful movie. It's entertainment, plain and simple. For those of us who like Grease , it succeeds very well in entertaining! I'm just glad I never started counting the number of times I've seen it!
