Extremely hilarious film. This would go in my top 10 list of the funniest movies of all time. Great film of four very funny and eccentric characters who try to double cross one another to get their hands on some diamonds. Great cast with the Monty Python veterans John Cleese and Michael Palin, also stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline. Kline won an Academy Award for his role. Palin is a riot as the stuttering Ken. When Palin and Kline are on screen, you won't stop laughing. An extremely funny classic comedy.
