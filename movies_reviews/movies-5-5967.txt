Justifiably the current #1 in the classic movies section,and absolutely the greatest ever comedy.Scintillating Wilder-Diamond script,Curtis doing his best Cary Grant impression,Monroe(an underrated comic actress)radiant as ever.And the late Jack Lemmon's clearly having a ball. Among so many marvellous scenes,i particularly love the one where Sugar and the rest of the girl band clamber into his bunk on that train ride made in heaven.The film's not aged a bit;it's priceless.Having just seen it for about the seventh time,this is one case where familiarity breeds content.
