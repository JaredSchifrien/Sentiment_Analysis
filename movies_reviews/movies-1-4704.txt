Note to Hollywood: Never bill celebrities on a theatre poster when they're only in the film for 5 minutes. Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, and Patricia Arquette star in this children's bore based on a hit novel of the same name. All three stars are wasted, with the exception of Voight who is given FAR too much screen time!
