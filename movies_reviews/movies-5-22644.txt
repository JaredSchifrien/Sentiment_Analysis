Except for the costumes, I could not have been more pleasantly suprised at the true x-men feel to this movie.An unknown actor like Hugh Jackman did Wolverine about as good as you can do. I loved the little previews of characters like Iceman and Jubilee. This movie has me begging for a sequel that will include new costumes, new characters, and the development of the current ones.Check it out, bub!!!!!
