Better than the original by far... It's funny as hell, and has great imitations of other movies, e.g. Star Wars. If you don't see this, you will regret it. My only complaint is the new character of Jesse who has the most annoying voice and character you will ever see in a cartoon, but don't let it spoil woody and buzz's adventure. A terrific movie for all!!
