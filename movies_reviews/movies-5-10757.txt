It's definitely not the funniest movie I've ever seen, but boy, there are some scenes that are just hilarious to unearthly levels. I think what makes this comedy a good one, is its excellent cast from young to experienced. I'd probably have to point out Jon Lovits and remarkable Rowan Atkinson as the highlights in this movie. Whoopi Goldberg was ok, but her role didn't have really funny parts. It seems like the producers of this movie cast Rowan Atkinson in the condition that he would play Mr.Bean in it, and it's obviously typical Mr.Bean material you're laughing at on this movie. Wayne Knight also did a great job, and his character's personality, was also very close to the character of Newman in Seinfeld, which is what he does best. Overall, this movie is an entertaining family comedy, with some really good parts.
