One of the best childrens films I've ever seen. My grandfather usually falls asleep in childs films, but me, grandad, and my nephew went to see it, and he didn't fall asleep. Even commented on how good it was. Still is now. Do not miss. They've made a Toy Story 2 which is just as enchanting and wonderful. Summary: ONE OF THE BEST CHILDRENS FILMS I'VE SEEN.
