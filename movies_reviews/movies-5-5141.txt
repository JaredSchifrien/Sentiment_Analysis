At first I thought it was just a kids ecscuse for an action movie but it was very good. Its about a tenage boy named Cody Banks(Frankie muniz great)who allways gets nervous and stuters around girls. He had gone to a summer camp where they trained teens to work undercover with the csi.In his profile he is great with girls so he gets a mission to get close to a girl so he could find out about her dads secret project. Her dad is being forced to make insects to eat everything steel humans ect. The bad guy plan is to freeze them into ice cubes because if there not frozen they would eat everything they see. Send the ice cubes to csi and when they melt they would destroy the base. Meanwhile cody begins to like the girl(Hilarie Duff).I wont give away any more of the movie
