A movie about honor, and the pride to two military leaders going head to head on a psychological battlefield instead of military combat. I'm not sure why people refer to it as such a great war movie, because their isn't any actual war like fighting in it. It takes place in a POW camp, and is a study of character in extreme situations. If you are looking for a what I think of more as a war movie, such as Saving Private Ryan, or Platoon this probably isn't what you are after. If you are interested in studying the character of a man and an emotionally provoking ending, by all means get this movie. Simply terrific! Oh by the way it was nominated for about 9 Academy awards, and won for best picture and actor.
