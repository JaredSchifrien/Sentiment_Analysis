The Outsiders, written by S.E. Hinton and directed by Francis Coppola is a fantastic movie that has a star-studded cast and great acting. C. Thomas Howell stars as 'Ponyboy', the dreamy Greaser who gets in big trouble when his buddy 'Johnny' ( played by 'The Karate Kid' - Ralph Macchio ) kills a Soc'. The supporting cast is a who's-who of young actors including Patrick Swayze, Matt Dillon, Emilio Estevez, Diane Lane, and Tom Cruise. It is a coming of age movie that is rarely seen with the depth that this one has. Go reant this one and watch for all your favorite actors.
