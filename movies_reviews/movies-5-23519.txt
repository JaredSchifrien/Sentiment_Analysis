One of the few Unbelievably good thrillers to come out of John Carpenter's long and periodically disapointing career. This is one of the scariest chill bump inducing sci-fi movies I have ever had the privalledge to view. On a remote government base stationed in the middle of no where Antarctica strange things begin to happen when a dog is chased onto their base by a russian scientist from another near by base who is trying to kill the dog. The russian is killed before he gets a chance to kill the dog. What follows is one of the best ideas ever put to film. The alien being aboard this base ubsorbs living beings and tries to become them. The results are pure terror. This alien can mimic it's host perfectly so it always keeps you guessing as to who could be the alien. John Carpenter weaves another far out frightning tale. His flair for visual scares and gift for creating empeckable atmosphere are showcased here. Carpenter is a master story teller. To bad now a days all he gets are sh*t scripts. This film comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Any sci-fi,horror,great story fan should give themselves a great treat and watch this classic.
