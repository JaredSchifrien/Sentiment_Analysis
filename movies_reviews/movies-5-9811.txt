What an underrated movie. Michael Douglas and Annette Benning are both perfectly cast as the president and his girlfriend. And, the script is so well written. I heard that when Aaron Sorkin first wrote the script, the movie would have run about 3 hours or so. Well, he cut it down in all of the right spots. It is funny with several laugh out loud parts and is intelligently written. This also isn't a typical romantic comedy and appeals to men as much as women. It's on TNT about once a month, but do yourself a favor if you haven't seen it. Spend the $4 bucks and rent it. It's that good.
