I recently made a huge mistake. I went to see Blair Witch 2. I saw the first one and it was pretty good, so I figured I might as well go and see the sequel. It was horrible. The characters were weak, there was no plot, no motive, no anything. I've never fallen asleep during a horror movie before, but this time I found myself struggling to stay awake. The movie made absolutely no sense. Words simply cannot express how bad this movie was. It was a waste of $7.00, and I would'nt mind if the people behind this movie never did anything else ever again. If you thought the ending to the first Blair Witch was bad, wait until you see this one. I can't beleive I actually waisted my time and money on that garbage. Movies like this discourage me from ever going to the movies again. I've never been more pissed off at a movie than I was at this one. I'm just going to stop talking about it before I get angry. BLAIR WITCH 2 SUCKS! I beg others to go out and see this horrible movie so you can give some reviews about it. It would be nice to know if other people can also recognize bad movies when they see them, so I don't end up thinking I'm crazy.
