This is based on a Cole Porter play; and it holds up very well. Also, Porter's play was based on Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew; so the plot involving the war of the sexes, is timeless. Kathryn Grayson is the feisty Kate. Her voice is well suited to the sophisticated music of Porter. Howard Keel is charismatic as the strutting male, who is bound to tame Kate. One of the many favorite moments is when Kate sings I Hate Men. Both of them had co-starred in the boxoffice smash hit of 1951, Show Boat. Ann Miller tap-dances a superb number solo. She also joins other exciting dancers in a group number. Among these great dancers, are: Tommy Rall, Bobby Van, Carol Haney and Bob Fosse. Comedy turns by the team of Keenan Wynn and James Whitmore are a plus.
