I love this movie almost as much as Ron Burgandy loves scotch! If you are into the 'Zoolander' and 'Old School' type of comedy, this one is a must see! My friends and I have already began to quote our favorite lines. Although Ferrell hit home with this movie, it was Steve Carrell who kept me laughing. Go get your tickets NOW!!
