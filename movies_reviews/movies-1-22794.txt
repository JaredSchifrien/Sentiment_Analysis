I do not like this movie because it condones witchcraft and black magic, which is clearly evil and something we are to stay away from. When we are dealing with witchcraft, we are dealing with demonic powers, because we don't have magical powers. There is no such thing as using magic for good. Maybe the person may be using it for good in their mind, but that power is from the devil. He is mucking around with their mind and fooling them into believing that they are using his power for good. There are lots of Bible verses that speak against witchcraft, magical arts, astrology, psychics, fortune tellers etc. Some people may think that white magic is good, but whether it is black or white, it is still evil and God hates it. Black magic is using physical magic eg spells and doing a lot of the stuff on Harry Potter and Charmed. White magic is dealing with psychic powers, manipulating people's emotions and will, fortune telling, astrology etc. Using Satan's power is like throwing your steak dinner to lions. They will rip the steak up and eat it, turn around and rip you to pieces. Satan is a horrible, unfair bank dealer. Most banks charge interest, but the devil lends you money, but charges 200% interest.
