I give this 5 stars, not for being a good movie, but for being an ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY HILARIOUS movie. I could watch it over and over again. THIS WAS A SCREAM! ( Shut your f**king face, uncle f**ker ) See it, and see it now. The funniest movie I've ever seen, funnier than Austin Powers and even Life Of Brian. See it. Summary: AN ABSOUTELY HILARIOUS AND ORIGINAL CARTOON MOVIE.
