A masterwork. Flawless script, brilliant cinematography and editing, incredible performances. Not surprising that with a first film this incredible that Welles could never equal it. Arguably the greatest film ever. UPDATE: Seraph, not to be unkind, but the movie is meant for adults, not for teenagers.
