One of my favorite vampire movies, if only because I was a kid when it came out and was so much in love with corey feldman and even though he was a background player in this movie, I watched every movie he was in. First time I ever watched Keifer Sutherland, and he was excellant in this movie. I compare his every movie to this one. The story was awesome, the vampires rocked, the music was truly supurb! If you like vampire movies and have not seen this one, you need to definitely rent it, but I would suggust going ahead and buying it on DVD because if your like me, It's a must have movie.
