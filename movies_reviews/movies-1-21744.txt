Hated it. This was my favourite chapter of the LOTR books, and Peter Jackson killed it. All the major parts of the novel were missing- at the end the Hobbits return to find that Saruman is in the Shire, and without Gandalf or Aragorn they clean the Shire of the evil men and Saruman (who tried to kill Frodo)- this is all missing.. It looks like Hollywood got their claws in this one- it made the new Star Wars movies look good. Maybe if you never read the books you could be taken away by the magnificent storyline- but this was Tolkiens work- not the movies. All the time wasting they did at the end with tearful goodbyes could have been utilised by showing the Hobbits battle in the Shire. Bad job- it spoiled the series for me.
