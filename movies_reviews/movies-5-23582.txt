A masterpiece by John Boorman.The greatest cinematic version of the Arthurian legends.As another posted noted too much story for so little time so dramatic license had to be used for some characters. This movie had an allstar cast of great and soon to be great actors:Nicol Williamson as Merlin is the scenestealer in a cast including Patrick Stewart,Liam Neeson,Gabriel Byrne,Helen Mirren,Nigel Terry and Nicholas Clay.It is somewhat strange that the actors playing Arthur and Lancelot two of the three leads did not achieve bigger stardom.The Irish countryside and effects are incredible. A must see for the fantasy,action movie fan.
