Bogart is at his best as a good guy (Frederick B. Dobbs) who comes down with deadly case of gold fever in the classic morality tale. Walter Huston and Tim Holt also give fine performances as iconic scenes ("Stinking badges" and the "Walter Huston dance") pepper this tale of greed and futility. Little Bobby Blake makes an appearence as the Mexican boy that sells Bogie the winning lottery that serves as the financial grubsteak needed to get the expedition off and running. Classic scenes from this film have been hilariously parodied in the ensuing years following it's release including a great Bugs Bunny take-off and Bart, Millhouse, and Martin Prince playing the principals (Bart had Bogie's role)in a Simpson's episode where the boys pool their funds to buy a rare comic book.
