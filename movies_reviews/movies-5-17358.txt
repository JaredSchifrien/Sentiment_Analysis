This movie is trademark Almodocar. Crazy, distrubing, touching, but hilarious. Including Almovodar regularas like Carmen Maura, and a 20 something Antonio Banderas, this movie is about women on the verge.....and women in love. While the basis of the story line isn't original (a woman getting dear johned by her her lover for someone else (ironically, she was the other woman with this guy too.) How she reacts to it, and the steps she takes to finally confront him are what the movie is about, and that is where things get crazy. This was the first movie by Almodovar that I'd ever seen, and I became and instant fan.
