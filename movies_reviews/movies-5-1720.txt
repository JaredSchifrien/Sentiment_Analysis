This movie was one of the best war movies ever made. I dont know what people are talking about having no story line or not feeling the character . This movie is not a happy happy joy joy movie, its a movie about real men who went into the middle of a warzone and died for somthing they thought was right. If you want happy happy movies stick to your Disney movies.
