An amazing movie. Funny, sad, weird - i loved everything about from the dark role that Bill Murray played, to the odd soundtrack, to the ridiculous scene when all the little kids are dressed like wizards throwing rocks at the bullies. This is not necessarily a feel good movie, but it's also not a movie that tries to be powerful by being depressing - it's just an odd little flick that is really moving.
