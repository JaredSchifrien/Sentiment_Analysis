Awesome. There's high expectations with Pixar animated films, yet this one managed to exceed mine. THE INCREDIBLES puts welcome spins on the superhero genre. A superhero family is forced into conforming into a mediocre lifestyle due to a lawsuit happy society. Exceptional circumstances inspire them to get their groove back with brilliantly original kinds of scenes that will delight even the most jaded moviegoer. Don't miss the hilarious sequence on the dangers of wearing a cape. It's more inspired than FINDING NEMO, and has more in it to please adults.
