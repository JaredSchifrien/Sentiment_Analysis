This movie sucks. No plot, no talent, no fun action. This movie is Lame! With a capital L! Aaliyah needs to stick to her singing and Jet Li needs to find better action script because he can fight, he just isn't a convincing actor. The plot is way to scatter brained and really makes no point to keep the viewer interested. The only redeeming quality of this movie are the shots that show an X-ray of the damage as it is being caused. Hardlly makes up for such a waist of time and money, on both the studios part and on the consumers.
