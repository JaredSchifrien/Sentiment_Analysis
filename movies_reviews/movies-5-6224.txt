Directed by Arthur Penn, Bonnie And Clyde (1967) was considered a new wave film at the time of its release and is considered a landmark film due to its use of sympathetic anti-heroes. For the uninitiated, the movie revolves around the adventures of dysfunctional couple Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) and Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) as they go on a crime spree. The supporting cast is impressive, including Michael J. Pollard, Gene Hackman, and Denver Pyle. Portrayed as modern day Robin Hoods, Bonnie and Clyde appealed to the late 1960's counter-culture, notwithstanding the criticism from conservative mainstream press and critics. The movie is still studied in film schools for its long-term social influence and camera angles, for instance the closing shot from the point of view of the bullet-ridden vehicle. The bottom line is that Bonnie And Clyde remains relevant today and has aged well, even for a classic movie.
