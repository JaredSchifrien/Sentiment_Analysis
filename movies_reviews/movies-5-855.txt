Great movie. I was totally tricked in the end. I saw the clues throughout the movie, but I didn't pick up on it. That's great! It was totally scary, especially the part where the little boy is trapped in the attic with some kind of monster or something. The plot was cool, and it kept me on my toes through the movie. I highly recommend it.
