This film is great! I don't think any other film, can hit the subject of capital punishment right on target. Susan Sarandon portrays Sister Helen Prejean incredibly. She tried to minister both the murderer's family and the murder victim families. This film is full of great quotes, such as you shall know truth, it will set you free. The execution scene in the end, was very VIVID, it gave me chills to my spine. It made me think I was watching a documentary, that's how powerful it was. Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone, interested in the subject of capital punishment and wanting to learn more about it.
