An absolute masterpiece. In my opinion, the finest movie ever made. Some have complained that it is slow, but with the jaw dropping visuals, I strongly disagree. The scene where Rachel is being quizzed by Deckart has got to be one of the most sensitively filmed scenes in the history of cinema. Incidentally, when this movie came out in the early 1980's, it absolutely bombed. I think this is a testament, perhaps, on how far we have come as a society of movie lovers. The movie takes a pretty high level of concentration and I feel it was way too subtle for the audiences of the 80's generation. It has since experienced phenomenal rental revenue. The DVD is available now as well. Enjoy...
