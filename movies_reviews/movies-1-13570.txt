Although there were some very poignant moments in this film, it completely glorified a sick obsession that is not only illegal in all states (except maybe Arkansas) but morally depraved - I'm talking about pedophyllic behavior. The language of the 16 year old girl is right out of a white trash trailer park - it totally disgusted me.
