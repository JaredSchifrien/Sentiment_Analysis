This was a sorry excuse for a horror movie. They tried to build up the suspense in it, but failed miserably. I frankly couldn't care less what happened to the characters. In fact, throughout the movie I found myself wishing that each of them died a horrible very torturous death. I will admit the camera angle of the very last scene was a cool camera shot. However, that last 10 seconds was about the only redeeming thing about this movie.
