while i can't enjoy this movie everytime i see it as much as i did the first time i saw it, it still holds a place among the top films of all time. first of all, it has peter sellers in it, who kubrick put into three roles in dr strangelove and who was perhaps the only person capable of outdoing george c scott's work in that film. this is peter sellers from lolita and the pink panther one of the most talented actors comedic or otherwise, ever. he plays a childlike man accidentally raised to the role of brilliant philosopher and presidential economic advisor and public figure through a series of strange, seemingly divinely inspired events that manage to appear funny and charming while simultaneously being insanely unlikely. the movie is full of heart and beauty, while also being bitingly satirical, both of its time and the tv-brainsucker-victims of ours. the film requires complete attention, especially for the delicate sequences at the end, and seller's understated delivery, which at times is so poignant as to be painful. one of the best.
