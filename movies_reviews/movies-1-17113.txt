Are you kidding me? Did you SEE this movie? I'm not sure where to start. And I'm not sure a movie this bad is even worth a long review. But I feel the need to do my civic duty and warn people who are thinking about renting this movie: DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I MADE! If you ever find yourself wanting to rent this movie, have a friend hog-tie you until you come to your senses. Really - this movie is awful. And it's not even awful in a funny way - it's awful in a boring, overly dramatic way. What was Tom Cruise thinking? His character (along with all the others) is just not likeable - nor is he unlikeable in a love to hate way. It's hard to enjoy a movie when you can't empathize with any of the characters. Poor Kubrick. How can the director of Clockwork Orange deteriorate so much? With a proper story and decent directing, the acting might have been OK. But Cruise and Kidman had nothing to work with. They put their faith in Kubrick, and he laid an egg on them.
