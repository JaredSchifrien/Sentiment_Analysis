When I finished reading Gone with The Wind I was devestated that it was over. I immediately flipped back to the beginning to remember 'how it used to be'. I was only 14. The movie carried me away once again! It was fate that cast Vivien Leigh as Scarlet, and who else but Clark Gable could have been Rhett Butler?! I felt like shaking Scarlet and yelling, 'it's Rhett you love, can't you see that? HE'S the one! Don't let him go! 'Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn!' is one of the best parting lines written.
