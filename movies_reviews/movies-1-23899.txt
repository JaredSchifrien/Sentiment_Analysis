If you are going to tell one of histories greatest storys don't mess with it. Achilies never sees the inside of Troy as he is shot in the heal. It one of the the biggest parts of Homer's story but Hollywood comes along and change a major part. The effects were nice but the acting was not that great and neither was the script.
