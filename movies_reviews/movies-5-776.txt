Went to see this at the cinema with a friend who decided to tell me what the twist was 10 minutes into the sodding film. I still totally and utterly enjoyed the film though. For the past ten years or so Bruce Willis has really flourished in the diverse roles that he has taken and he outshines in this. Haley Joel Osmand shows depth and plays his role convincingly. Toni Colette who plays the mother held up the standard of acting. A very emotional and sometimes scary film that is definately worth watching.
