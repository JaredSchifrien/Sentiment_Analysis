Incredibly good. Suspenseful, creative, decent science fiction, and well acted. Who would have thunk the movie would feature 2 future Governors (It would have been 3 as they originally cast Jim McGreevey as the Predator's boyfriend). Apollo Freakin Creed was in it too. This movie drips with testosterone.
