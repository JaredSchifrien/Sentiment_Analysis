Normally, I tend to get prolific when I rate movies, but this there is not much to say about. It ranks with I dreamed of Africa and everything else Basinger has done besides Batman and LA Confidential as absolute garbage. The plot is ludicris, the acting was so coarse and seemingly unrehearsed, and the effects were terrible. Had the director removed the effects and given it a tone more like a Polanski film, it might have been slightly revived. I wish I could given this film no stars.
