Comedy style similar to Naked Gun, so if you like one you should watch the other. Features a very fast paced approach to jokes so the viewer needs to pay attention. I've seen it at least 15 times and I still pick up on something new each time I watch it. There is always some kind of humor taking place in the background, so it's more than just the lines than make the movie funny.
