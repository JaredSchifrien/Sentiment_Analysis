Excellent movie. The thing that got me hooked was the dreaminess of it. The music flowed. The lighting contrasts were genious. The way the mood changed from being dreamy to eery. Although strange at times, it depicts perfectly how teenagers can feel at times. Sofia Coppola's talent really becomes obvious in this dramatic movie. ..You're a stone fox..
