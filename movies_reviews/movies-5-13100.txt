great movie! praise to spielberg for bringing the holocaust to life. equal amounts of praise to neeson, kingsley, and fiennes for the roles of a lifetime. this movie should've won awards. oh that's right, it did...it was obviously the academy's best picture, and the afi ranked it in the top 10 of all-time best. not bad.
