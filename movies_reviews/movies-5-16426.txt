This haunting tell of 5 sisters was amazing. the dying trees symbolized the girls themselves, and their hope was the sun. Lux fell in love with the man whore, who in turn screws with her head. Then she alone and in lock down with her sisters are doomed for suiicide and their fate in general, of what life has mapped out for them.... amazing almost a direct story of my life, but with more of a twist.....
