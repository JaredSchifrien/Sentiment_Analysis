Grease is a great musical it is one of my favorites. There is really good acting in this movie and there are great songs. When Sandy comes to Rydell high and later finds out that Danny the boy she fell i love with over the summer goes there she gets excited but Danny messes things up. In the end everything turns out all right though. I just don't think Sandy should have changed just to make Danny happy.
