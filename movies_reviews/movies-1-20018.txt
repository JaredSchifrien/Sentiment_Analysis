WHAT WAS SEAN CUNNINGHAM THINKING WHEN HE CREATED THIS SH*T??? He completly destroyed one of the coolest killers in cinematic history. Jason isn't killing people, it is a nasty little demon critter. WHAT!!???!!! So, it isn't Jason? After all these years? I like the idea of the FBI going after Jason, but they did it in a very cheap and unappealing manner. I love Jason and this series, but this film does the man no justice what so ever. Now all we can do is pray that Jason X will kick this movie in the ass.
