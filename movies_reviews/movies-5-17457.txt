If you think that black white movies have no visual interest for you, think again and try this movie. The way the light shines trough the leaves on the trees is absolutely magic. The story of the movie is simple, or is it? You'll hear from different people and a ghost what occurred,and you will have to make up for yourself what happened. Great Japanese story.
