Being a dancer, this movie inspired me to exell in my ballet. it also taught me more about it, such as positions and such. The dancing was beautiful and showed how hard you have to work to get there . i would recomend this movie to dancers of ALL types. though i must say, the acting wasnt wonderful, ya know now that anorexia girl threw a fit in front of her boyfriend...that was pretty bad acting
