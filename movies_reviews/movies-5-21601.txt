This movie is a masterpiece, plain and simple. Very beautiful scenery and effects, and a well thought-out and well acted storyline. I also like how the movie doesn't have an actual chapter ending just like the book. The main ending will come at the end of the third one. It's kind of different from Star Wars where they would have an actual chapter ending at the end of each movie. It is also very detailed when it comes to every character(appearance and background), history, the world of role playing (or realm of RP. However you put it), and of course the book itself.. If you haven't seen it, GO SEE IT!!!!
