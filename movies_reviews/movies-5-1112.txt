My faverout movie of all time, I'll say that first. Released to a hail of critisism. In fact they gave it an X rating, virtualy unheard of outside the world of hardcore pornography, lol. Scarface in its time boasted an all time record amount of swears, making use of the F word almost 200 times. But this film is worth more than its dated shock value. Operatic and overblown, this film apeals to anyone looking for a film with a minamum amount of arsing around - the is no love sceans no attempt to bring shade or depth to Montana's character, he is defined by his actions as a pure bad guy - the ultimate anti-hero icon. Endlessly watchable and quotable, you'll either love it for its in you r face vilolence and agression or hate it for its bloatedness and linear simplicity. Its all about one scumbags rise and fall, and alot of Coke and carnage!
