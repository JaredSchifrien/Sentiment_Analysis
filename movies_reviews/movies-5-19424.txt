Fulci is a god. This is the epitomy of the Zombie movies. All others should bow to Fulci. I remember seeing this movie at the drive in theatre, and it scared me lifeless at that young age. Watching it now still brings back the chills. Please rate this film higher, cause if there was a Hall of Fame for horror movies, this would be a first year shoein.
