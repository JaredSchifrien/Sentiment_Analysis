This was one of the only movies I have ever walked out of. It is the worst thing I have seen in a long, long time. The theatre we saw it in accidentally played one of the reels upside down and backwards. That was the only time we laughed. We were lucky though, because we saw it at the cheap theatre and it only cost us $1.50 each. Of course, we still felt ripped off.
