As you can see by my username this film terrifies me. Even today if I'm far out from the beach I think of this movie and it's music. Steven Speilberg even more amazingly was only about 26 (the same age as me) when he directed it. The chances of seeing a movie as effective as this again are extremely slim. Also does anyone know about this new version that was supposed to be released a couple of years ago in theaters. I've heard nothing more about the re-issue plans. I'd just love to see it on the big screen, that would really be something!
