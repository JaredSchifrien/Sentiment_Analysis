Having just recently seen this movie, I must say that I was quite impressed. It's one of the most suspenseful thrillers I've seen in a long time, and along with Seven is probably tied for the best cat and mouse film of the 1990s. Morgan Freeman is as always completely convicing, and manages to pull off playing the role of an almost unrealistically brilliant detective quite well. At a few points in the film, I was actually asking myself, How the hell did this guy figure this out?. Despite this, Freeman still plays the part well, and is supported by a great cast including Ashley Judd, Jay O'Sanders and Cary Elwes, who is quite good in the film. Overall, minus a few holes in the plot, Kiss the Girls is a great thriller and rivals Seven as one of the most provocative thrillers of its decade. It keeps a hold on the viewer's attention all the way through the film and climaxes with an explosive and surprising ending.
