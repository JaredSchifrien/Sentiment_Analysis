To add on to a couple more great parts....when Tommy is being Darth Vadar into the fan...'Luke, I am your father'...and to add to when he gets hit with the board, 'it doesn't hurt here or here, but more RIGHT HERE'. Or what about the part when he meets his new step brother and he says, 'brothers don't shake hands, brothers got to hug.' Or when he goes cow tipping, falls and then at the gas station he is dancing around singing, 'I'm a maniac, maniac on the floor, dancing...' This movie is so great. It is my favorite comedy movie. It is tied with Dumb and Dumber. You can watch these two movies over and over. It is so sad he had to die, but at the same time, as crazy as he was, he couldn't have made it too far.
