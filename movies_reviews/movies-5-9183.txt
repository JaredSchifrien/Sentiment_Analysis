Recently, I've become skeptical of the quirky and daring films that make movie critics swoon (like American Beauty), which are so often just predictable and pretentious. But here's a wonderful exception: Being John Malkovich is a huge joyride of a movie. Almost every scene is 100% bizarre, but the humor is mostly really subtle. As over-the-top as the whole concept is, there's nothing gratuitous (the way any of Tarantino's imitators would have it). Excellent acting, funny script, perfectly directed by Spike Jonez.
