What a horrible movie! Leo can't act. There are many holes in the plot. Too big of an age difference between Winslet and DiCapprio. There are too many modern cliches in this early 1900's film. Why didn't Leo have an accent like the others on the boat? I liked the detail of the movie like the props, plates, clothing, etc. It was so long!
