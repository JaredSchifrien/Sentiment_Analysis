this movie is truly an incredible piece of art. I can not say this movie was an enjoyable , but it is both unforgetable and haunting. While some people reviewed this talking about the lack of nudity, that is totally not what this movie is about. the acting is incredible, and elly burstyn should have won an oscar for this. also, the music is so important to this movie, especially in creating the mood. This includes the incredibly stunning last ten minutes. This is definetly a director we should be expecting great things from in the future.
