The jokes never seemed to wear out for me , even though I went to see the movie 4 times. It was a brilliant film, brings you back to see it a second time. I reccomend this movie to anyone who wants to see Mel Gibson's acting in a different kind of genre. It's a great movie. Helen Hunt and Mel definetly look cute together. Go see it!
