A classic from 1944, this farcical comedy is one of the best theatrical comedy features of all time. Although the plot involving the discovery of dead people might seem grizly to some, it is done so tastefully and some twists are so wonderfully unexpected that it is hardly noticable. Performances all across the board are great here, but Cary Grant's over-the-top, double-take-filled performance is certaintly the highlight. There is also alot of slapstick and dumb characters, which add to the fun. The ending is as crazy as the rest of the movie, making the viewing experience that much more satisfying.
