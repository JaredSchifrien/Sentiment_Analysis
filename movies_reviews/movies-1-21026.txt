This movie sucked, and the music sucked. The gist of The Wall is we should all feel sorry for this rock star because he's tired of the rat race and his dad died in World War II. There are about a million other folks who are tired of the rat race and there are plenty of people who have lost their dads and they don't go out and make abysmal pulp like The Wall. Irishgit's assertion that this movie would be fine for a high school junior's film project is dead on.
