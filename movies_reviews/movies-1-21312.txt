This movie is so bad, pointless and wastes a lot of talent, except for the Bee Gees who suck. This movie should have never been made, it is horrifficly bad. If you are any kind of Beatles fan do not see this movie. If you are not a Beatles fan do not see this movie. It is probably one of the worst movies ever made. The only redeaming thing about it is Aerosmiths Version of Come Together.
