Girl, Interrupted is based upon a true story written by Susanna Kaysen (played by Winona Ryder), who is falsely accused of being crazy. Placed in a mental institution, she is confroted with the desicion of her life. She must decide on whether she wants to get better, or to spend her life being insane. The only thing standing in her way is the controlling, sociopath, Lisa (played by Angelina Jolie.) Director, James Mangold, has been critisized for the movies flat plotline, and inability to transfer the book into a movie. I agree that the films plot took a different route than most flicks, but to say it had no plot at all is an understatement. Those that say it had no plot, probably didn't understand it. With Ryder co-producing and starring in the flick, how can it go wrong? Not to mention other incredible performances by Angelina Jolie, Whoopie Goldberg, Brittany Murphy, Clea Duvall, and many more. Lets face it, we all can relate to feeling a little crazy sometimes..okay, maybe not as crazy as some of the characters eating grapes off of the wallpaper, but crazy in some sense. This movie is a MUST-SEE, and definetly deserves this 5 star rating!! Copyrighted 2000 Kris10 R. Lee
