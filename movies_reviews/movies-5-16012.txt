I loved this movie! The plot is great (though I must admit, though I liked the ending, I didn't like the sequence or some of the camera angles used in it). The acting is great, and the themes of isolation and individuality were really great. The soundtrack was almost in danger of out performing the film itself- the Shins rule, for those who don't already know. And the though they only played it for like 30 seconds, the Iron and Wine cover of Postal Service's From Such Great Heights seemed really cool. If you're gonna see one movie, see this one.
