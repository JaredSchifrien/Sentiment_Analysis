I didn't actually sit down for this movie, but working at a theater, I saw enough of it. I refuse to reward Jim Davis' next effort to over-commercialize his characters and grab more money with more than one star. I mean, the Garfield comic's storyline isn't complicated. Would it have been so difficult to stay true to it? Nermal is a cute, gray kitten. Arlene is tall and white. And having Liz give in to Jon's affections completely butchers the personalities of both characters. And would it have been so tough for ALL the animal characters to be CGI, and not just Garfield?
