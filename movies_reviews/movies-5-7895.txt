I just noticed that a reviewer with the name callmetootie gave Spinal Tap one star and called it a failed attempt. Curious about someone who could make such an ignorant statement about one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, I clicked on callmetootie's name and read some more of his/her comments. Quickly it became apparent that callmetootie is a complete idiot. This person's 1,000+ comments are polluting RateItAll with senseless drivel. This Is Spinal Tap is one of the most intelligent, sarcastic, and hilarious movies of the past 30 years. If, like callmetootie, you dislike Spinal Tap and yet rave about the TV show Judge Wapner's Animal Court, do us all a favor and keep your mouth shut.
