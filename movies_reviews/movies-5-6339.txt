This is a truly beautiful, touching movie dealing with the problems, readjustments and every day experiences encountered by veterans returning home from WWII. It is a timeless and universal tale about everyone who has ever left home and had to deal with something devastating in their lives and attempts to reconcile the inevitable changes within themselves with what they once had taken for granted as the norm. If you can't relate personally, you know someone who can. Great cast, great writing, great acting, and wonderful sentiment.
