This became the number one movie???? How utterly embarrasing. The thing which I will only refer to as The Donkey Show should be burned. This movie promotes destruction of property, brainlessness, profanity use and disrespect for the parental bring-up. And, to make things even worse, it had to have over an hour cut out just to make it R-rated. Gross, crude, lewd and appealing to the lowest common denominator, boycott this and see another great movie that is family-friendly instead! And, as for JKooks, I haven't used a profane word in almost seven years and consider myself quite cool, regardless.
