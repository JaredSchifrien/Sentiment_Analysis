As you might be able to tell by now, I'm a bit of a sci-fi fan. Yet again, this is another film that I grew up with and still love. This film has a very good sense of humour and is very sharp. It starts off in present day (mid 1980's) and then goes through the centuries with the main character Conner McCleod. Originally from the Scottish Highlands and banished due to being labelled as being in league with Lucifer as he did not die in battle when he should have done. Eventually Sean Connery's character comes into play and tells Conner that he is immortal and teaches him the skills he needs to know for The Gathering. You have fantastic lines such as 'You overdressed Haggis' All the immortlas must fight eachother (using swords of course) The only way they can be killed is by having their head chopped off and the victor gets its opponents power and strength. Only one will survive and he gets the 'prize' and will know every thought of everyone on the planet and will now what is happening worldwide ( a bit like God really) The soundtrack is fab - but then again, its done by Queen so it will be. The love thread is not too sickening and 'Who Wants To Live Forever' sets it off really well. Fantastic.
