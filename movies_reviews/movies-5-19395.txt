Whatever John Malkovich is in always turns out great. Shadow of the Vampire isn't your everyday Giant budget jump out of your pants horror flick. Shadow of the Vampire takes you behind the making of Nosferateu. Of course Nosferateu is played by William Dafoe who believe it or not should get nominated for an oscar. I have seen so many vampire movies and horror movies having to do with vampires but you really got into his character. He did an excellent job portraying a dark figure with a little of comedy. In the Shadow of the Vampire Malkovich again hits us with a brillant performance in which he plays the director of the original movie Nosferateu . When the movie ends you don't know weather to love him or hate him. Excellent movie. Search down a theatre to find where it plays because its definetly a movie all people must see if you appreciate excellent acting.
