Hilarious! Will Smith and Kevin James worked surprisingly well together, and Eva Mendes is smart and sexy. Even Amber Valetta is better than the average model turned actress. Also look for Julie Ann Emery in a small but funny role as Eva's friend. Yeah, it gets a little sappy at times, but just when you start to reach for the Pepto Bismol Smith's face swells from an allergic reaction or there is some silly dancing. Not your average romantic comedy, and most definately worth a look.
