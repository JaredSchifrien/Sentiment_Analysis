Wow, this movie was a breath of fresh air! The original plot (a puppeteer discovers a portal that leads into John Malkovich's brain) takes you on a wild ride, reminiscent of The Twilight Zone. There are surprises at every turn, and the show is filled with incredibly strange situations and bizarre humor. The movie was well-cast, too, with John Cusack as a dissatisfied, impulsive puppeteer and Cameron Diaz as his dippy, confused wife. (Diaz shed her glamour girl image so effectively, I didn't even recognize her until I read the credits.) The show gets off to a great start and never slows down. Not once did I look at the clock during the movie. If you're in the mood for a mind-expanding, creative show, Being John Malkovich is a great choice.
