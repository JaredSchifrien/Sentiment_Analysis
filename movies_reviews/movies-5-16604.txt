I loved this movie. It has the best original screenplay written all year. Maybe the best cast assembled too. Joan Allen and Gary Oldman give some of their best performances ever, but neither can compare to Jeff Bridges. He's really amusing as a President. Bridges character seems to more focused on food than running the country. His final speech at the end of the movie is one of the best movie monologues I've heard in years. It's too bad this movie wasn't more successful. I can't see anyone disliking this movie. Rent it if you get a chance. I doubt you'll be disapointed.
