EWWW! i would never ever ever waste my time on this movie again. i cant believe i wasted $7.75 on it! i kept thinking the movie was going to get better but it didnt. it was soo boring.most of people in the theatre walked out like half way in the movie. i thought it dragged on sooo bad-no i mean reeeeaaal bad! i still dont understand the point of the movie. but its all good.
