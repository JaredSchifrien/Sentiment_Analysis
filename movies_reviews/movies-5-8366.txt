There was no doubt in my mind that this was a boy in a man's body! Hanks had this part down perfectly, even down to the body language of a 12 year old. The piano scene in F.A.O. Schwartz is a classic..as is the boy in the man's suit going home to his mom and leaving behind his love that is probably about the same age as his mother!
