. . . this is one of those ones where you're gonna either love it or hate it. I'm in the latter camp. Okay, so I haven't seen Rob Zombie's previous move, House of 1000 Corpses; I did figure, Yeah, this is probably going to be a little bizarre, violent, whatever, I can deal with that.. Besides, my husband really wanted to see it. He's the type who likes that bizarre stuff. I can deal with violence. But I don't appreciate POINTLESS violence much. I mean, really, there wasn't really much of a plot: Crazy possibly-imbred psycho family gets hunted down by equally psychotic sheriff. Yeah, whatever. If you're fairly sensitive to depictions of sexual violence, yeah, this movie DEFINATELY isn't for you. It was just one scene, but I seriously actually wanted to vomit. (Which is a feat, there's only one other movie that made me want to throw up; this movie also has the distinction of being one of the few that I've actually wanted to walk out of). And, what's worse, people in the theater were LAUGHING. WTF? I don't know what I was disgusted at more, the movie or the people in the theater. Okay, so that's my fault; I should've done some research before walking into the theater, I'll take full responsibility for that one. I don't really care if this movie pushed the extremes on violence, nudity, and profanity: yeah, it's never been done before, but it doesn't make it GOOD. If you're okay with all that, go ahead and buy the DVD, knock yourself out. At least I know better now to skip any future Rob Zombie flicks.
