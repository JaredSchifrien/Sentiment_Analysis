One of the best sports movies ever made. This movie almost didn't get made. It was written by at that time and unknown(Sylvester Stallone) and acted by largely a cast of unknowns as well and shot on a very low budget. It was also the first movie to use the steadycam. Yet it won best picture at the 1976 Oscars overcoming all odds..just like Rocky did in the movie. I can totally relate to the character of Rocky, a man so down in life and nobody gives him a chance they look down on him. It's just a movie about overcoming obstacles in life..and even if you don't succeed completely, atleast you went all the way.
