When I was an (immature!) teenager the three things which particularly attracted me to this film were : 1) How gorgeous Fay Wray looked in the palm of the ape! 2) How hilarious was the huge close-up of King Kong's face and 3) a morbid fascination with the fate of the unfortunate villagers when Kong broke into their settlement. With the benefit of a few more years of experience I find my feelings have remained - er - exactly the same! A hugely enjoyable and strangely moving film.
