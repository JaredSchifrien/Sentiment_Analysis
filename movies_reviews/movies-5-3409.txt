I thought that Pearl Harbor was an AWESOME movie. All of you that say it was rubbish or whatever...you are just screwed up in the head. Ok, some people were put off by the whole romance situation that was going on...ya know....romance was happening even at a hard time in US history too...not just the fighting. I think that romance made the whole movie more personal...you felt more of a connection for the characters...it gave it something that it needed to make the movie better than if could have been if it were just BLAH fighting.
