I can honestly say that I have never heard anyone say a bad thing about this movie. The message about the triumph of the human spirit contained in it is universal and seems to appeal to everyone regardless of gender, age, race, etc. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give fantastic, heartfelt performaces along with their exceptionally strog supporting cast. This is a timeless movie that gets it right on every level - a wonderful version of Stephen King's excellent story.
