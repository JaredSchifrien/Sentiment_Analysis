A superb and hilarious movie with underlying sexual themes with out being too blunt, over the top or even too subtle for that matter. Wonderful casting of Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, George Raft and Joe E. Brown. Lemmon may have the energy, but Curtis is my personal favorite. Clever, witty and he does a dead on impression of Cary Grant. One of the funniest movies of all time.
