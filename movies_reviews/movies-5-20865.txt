I think a lot of folks here are missing the point of SNF. It's not just about the dancing or music, which is all great and entertaining, believe me. The Bee Gees wrote the soundtrack of the 1970s with that album! I love the energizing dance scenes and the quaint polyester clothes and Afro hairdos. But SNF is more than a musical - it's a real life gritty urban drama that I think it still relevant today. So what if it's depressing or harsh- that's the way life is in a blue collar urban setting. Tony's escape through dancing in contrast to his bleak life and dysfunctional family and friends is the heart and soul of the movie. Unlike most other musicals, it actually has a strong and relatable story line. The acting was great too, and all of the characters stand out beyond just one-dimensional cardboard cutouts. I think it's one of the best movies of the 1970s, if not all time!
