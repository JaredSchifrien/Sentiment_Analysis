More like Afterbirth, as in this stinkeroo was about as yucky as the stuff. Though I would have given it 2 stars because I didn't sleep through it, my wife actually booed it heartily as it cut to credits. This horrid movie had no mystery, suspense or scary moments (Theme: Married dude dies jogging and is reincarnated as a creepy little 10-year-old boy who insists he is widow's dead Dude husband. Finacee dude (who is a real schmuck) is not amused). Nicole Kidman plays the goofy widow/bride-to-be who gets mucked up in some Mary Kay Latournoesque scenes (which really grossed out my wife). Since the movie is so stinky, I am happy to give the plot away: little boy is not widow's dead dude husband, but actually a mixed-up kid whose head was becocked by some head games by the Anne Heche character (who was, best as I can tell, either dead dude's mistress or first wife or something, I don't even know). No one lives happily ever after, particularly the viewers. Nicole Kidman has been in 3 atrocities in a row (Dogville, Stepford Wives, and this stinker). I think her judgement is impaired since leaving Tom Cruise. Birth was in need of an abortion.
