Absolutely fantastic! Very OTT but great with it. Guy Pearce is definately shrugging off his history with the Australian soap 'Neighbours'. This film deals with homophobia as well, so if anyone is really against Queens and gay men, don't bother watching as you won't see it for what it really is, a great comedy where you empathise with the characters.
