I thought this was a very cleverly done film and was extremely entertaining. Shakespeare in Love was probably one of the few films I've seen in the last two years that I didn't walk out of feeling like I had just been screwed out of $8.50, and would've been willing to pay another $8.50 to see again while it was in the theatres. Very well done, very well acted, it was an all around entertaining film with some wonderful lines and metaphors. To the point of another user who said Shakespeare would be spinning in his grave I can think of nothing more than you really have no idea what you're talking about. In fact I would argue that Shakespeare would be amazed and overjoyed by this adaption/reproduction of his work. Certainly Shakespeare was an innovator of his time don't you think he would be happy to see, first of all just that his work was STILL being produced, and secondly that they had spun it into such a humorous form while still retaining the overall storyline? I do.
