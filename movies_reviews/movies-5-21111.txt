Great because it's The Who performing the songs - not actors. For those not familiar with the plot - it's sort of a "West Side Story" set in London. The teenager, Jimmy, feels like he's going schizophrenic - actually quadrophenic - because as he tries to please his 1) gang, 2)parents, 3)job and 4)girl - he's getting pulled in 4 different directions. The concept by Pete Townshend is that there a 4 different musical themes that correspond to the 4 different band members in The Who which corresponds to the 4 different personalities of Jimmy. The music blends in very well with the plot - rent it on DVD so you can put on the English subtitles because some of the dialog is hard to understand because the London accents.
