Cabaret is a classic and stands as one of the first overtly political musicals of all time. Liza Minelli is perfectly irritating as a sexy? English girl who has escaped to work as a call girl/performer in Berlin. Minelli's star persona and acting style combine to yield a personality that's too fun to resist but still somehow repugnant. Joel Gray is at his best in the queer role of eMcee with Bob Fosse handling choreography in his patented use of subtlety to evoke exciting sex. And for those of you visiting or living in New York, there's an ass kicking revival of the play on Broadway directed by Sam Mendes from American Beauty playing now.
