Okay, okay. I admit, I am of the age group that was a kid when this movie came out (and subsequently shown on TV once a year) so I loved it from childhood. But about 8 years ago, in my mid-20's, I saw it again and loved it. The songs all are great (excepting the one I never liked, Cheer Up Charlie ) and you simply have to admire Gene Wilder's awesome perforamce, all done with a knowing smile. The other kids are all quite memorable (especially in how they are dispatched). There is now a rock band called Veruca Salt. And on Will Grace recently, they mentioned August Gloop. A classic!
