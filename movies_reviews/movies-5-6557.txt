Another great classic and an even better read (as usual). Big Momma, Big Daddy, Sister Woman!! How can you not like a movie that uses nicknames like that. Paul's great as usual and Big Daddy does a great job too (whoever that guy was?). Not to forget Elizabeth Taylor.. We're so used to seeing her the way she is now and acting the role of the kinda quirky friend of Michael Jackson it's easy to forget that she was pretty talented and quite a head turner.
