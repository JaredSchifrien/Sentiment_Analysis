Among the plethora of crappy teen movies, this one shines as a beacon of hope. Based on the wonderful book by Nicholas Sparks, it stands as an uplifting yet often heartbreaking film. Mandy Moore proves what a fantastic talent she is as Jamie, the dowdy, wholesome pastor's daughter. Shane West is compelling and surprisingly good as the popular, shallow teen who falls in love with Jamie. There's some wonderful lessons about life, love and spirituality here. A tearjerker that's well worth it.
