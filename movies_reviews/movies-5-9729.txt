Robert Altman at his best.This spawned the t.v. series but is a much better product.Elliot Gould,Donald Sutherland and Tom Skerrit are three doctors not quite ready for the Military lifestyle.Sally Kellerman as Hot Lips and Robert Duvall star as the Army lifers who can't understand our heroes.Great comic sequences especially the football game abound.This isn't preachy like the series and will make you wish the series was more like the film.
