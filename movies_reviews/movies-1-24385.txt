Completely pointless and tasteless. I didn't see the point in ANY money being spent to make that film. Yuck. Never see it. Save yourself some money. What the heck was that chick?! Was she some kind of devil-angel person? Also, the last scene where Johnny Depp is with her was highly unecessary. What the heck was that for? Ugh... I just can't express how incredibly STUPID this movie was.
