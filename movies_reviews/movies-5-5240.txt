I think it is a great film to watch with children. They will love the silly scarecrow, the funny lion and the girls will want the red sparkly shoes so they can click the back of their heels and say "There is no place like Home." They will pretend to be the wicked witch of the West to other siblings by saying in a scary tone "I will get you my Pretty." They will sing and skip the tunes Were off to see the Wizard the wonderful wizard of oz.... Follow the yellow brick road.. etc. If you watch it for the first time as an adult you might not enjoy it as much as someone that has seen it as a child. I have a friend that saw it for the first time as an adult and he said, "I wished I would have seen this movie when I was a kid. I think I would have really liked it. The tornado has a certain amount of mystery to a child because you do not know what will happen when you get sucked up in it.
