The Life of David Gale is a powerful drama revolving around the controversial issue of capital punishment. The story revolves around David Gale (Kevin Spacey), an opponent of the death penalty who soon finds himself on death row for the murder of one of his closest friends. Kate Winslet, who plays a reporter in the film, is hired to interview Gale four days before his execution, and soon finds herself believing Gale's powerful story and sets out to find the truth. What follows is a suspenseful race against time, as the viewer is unsure of just what Winslet's character will find and if she will find it in time to save Gale's life. Some interesting twists and turns, a surprising ending and powerful performances by all involved makes for a decent film. The film was highly controversial in that it explored the possibility of error in the death penalty system, and I think the film proves its point quite well. Regardless of your opinion of the death penalty, this film is indeed a powerful one with a powerful message that captures the viewer's attention throughout.
