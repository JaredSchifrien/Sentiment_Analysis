It was better than the first because the first was setting up the story so teh second had more action. Kinda like Episode IV and V from Star Wars. I also loved it because it had Nightcrawler. X3 is coming out in May. Update: I may not see X3 since I have heard they may not have Nightcrawler in it and he was one of the best in the movie. They may do a Wolverine movie which means a slice and dice movie.
