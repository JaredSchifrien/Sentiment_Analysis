I happen to love the stupid stereotypes- even the affirmative actionone! I thought it was past time someone did a send-up of those stupid blaxploitation race movies! gets on soapbox If people would develop a sense of humor about our percieved differences- and not be so [expletive deleted] hypersensative- we would be in a lot better shape as a people. this movie is a step in the right direction. steps down off soapbox thank you...
