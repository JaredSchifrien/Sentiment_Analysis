Spike Lee, for some reason, received a lot of praise for this film. I thought it was a foul-mouthed bore of a movie, whose message got lost in all the cussing. Anyway, by the end of the movie all the characters--black AND white--were all so annoying, I didn't care what happened to any of them. Spike Lee said after the Oscars that year that he was robbed, but I think the only people who got robbed were the ones who paid to see this mess.
