Okay, so maybe the love triangle was a little contrived and annoying, but overall this was a good movie. I thought Jude Law and Ed Harris were especially good in their respective roles. The story of a Russian sniper was particularly interesting to me, as was the terror and insanity of the Battle of Stalingrad. If you ever get a chance to play the Russian part of the game Call of Duty you can see how the game was modeled after this movie -- everything from the dangerous river crossing to the rationing of ammo to the shooting of those who turned back is in there.
