Gladiator is one of the best movies I've seen when it comes to the time when gladiators,and the romen empire was said to be. It moves pretty fast so you dont get bored like some of the other moves. The plot is neat to Crowe starts out as General becomes a slave then becomes a Gladiator and upsets the Empire. You have to love it.
