This is my favorite Fred Astaire film. The story line is total fluff, and some of the editing is sketchy, but oh! The dancing! The film takes you to that 1930s fantasy world, where everyone is glamorous, everything has a happy ending, and people just suddenly find themselves dancing. Wonderful stuff!
