Me, being a dancer completely appreciated the movie. All those who said that the movie was missing a plot have to understand that difficulties it is to be a dancer. Even as a little kid they pick out every detail about you. They show that detail great in the movie. I personaly thought that this movie was excellent,and the dancing was awesome! There's this one part where they show Eva working hard on her dancing at night...and anyone who's a dancer can understand what thats like! Excellent movie! I totally reccomend it to any dancers out there...not too much for guys though...
