This is probably one of the best supernatural thrillers (horrormovies) I've seen in a very very long time! The Sixt Sense is very scary at some moments and I have to tell, it keeps me talking about even a month after I'd seen it. I asked a lot of questions to different people about things that happened in the movie that I didn't quite get. Almost all of my questions have been answered satisfactorily and I can now say, it is a great film. I didn't see how the movie was going to end because the moments you could have figured the ending out were very subtle exacuted. Joel has to get an Oscar nomination for his performance as well as the pretty original script. Furthermore, the movie was very stylishly made.
