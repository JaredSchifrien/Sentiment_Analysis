LOL I am still laughing after just seeing Happy Gilmore. I love this movie. All of the jokes were hilarious. Adam Sandler did a great job. Happy tries to save his Grandma's house and complains that see's old. And Happy goes and joins the tour and everyone should step right up and see if you can outdrive this golf club whacker guy.
