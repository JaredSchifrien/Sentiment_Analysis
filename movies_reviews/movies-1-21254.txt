Since there are now two versions, my question is, was anyone really buying Glen Close in this role? Meg Ryan is younger by a long shot and even SHE would be too old to play Nellie. If they were just trying to find work for older actresses, why not let Mitzi Gaynor reprise the role . Tsk, tsk. If you enjoy the story and music, stick with the much superior 1950's version.
