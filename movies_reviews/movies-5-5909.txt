James Stewart is caught in the middle of an Alfred Hitchcock classic based in the Bay Area and San Francisco Bay. Mr. Stewart is a detective called upon to investigate a wealthy man's wife who has mysteriously died. Mr. Stewart, however, is caught up in a twisted plot of love and deception as the dead wife inexplicably reappears from time to time, and an even stranger love enters his life. Highly recommended for those who enjoy a good plot twist and Alfred Hitchcock.
