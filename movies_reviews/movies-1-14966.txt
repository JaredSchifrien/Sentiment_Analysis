I thought that this movie was pathetic pro-American propaganda. It was historically inaccurate and made the British look like baby killing tyrants. That some people would pretend that it is historcally accurate is scary. It is pure entertainment and nothing more. Similar to Braveheart, which twisted history to try to make the British seem worse than the Nazis.
