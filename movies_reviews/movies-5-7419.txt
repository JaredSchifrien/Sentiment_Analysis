This is the funniest movie I have ever seen and after viewing it several times, I still laugh just as hard as the first time! Originally I saw it in a crowded theater and thank God everyone else found it just as funny as I did, people were laughing so loudly and I was literally in tears! You think of Robert DeNiro as a serious actor, and he is one of the greatest of all times, however he shows his comedic talent in this movie! I truthfully can not think of one thing I did not like about this movie.....no, that is not right, I can think of one thing...it had to end!
