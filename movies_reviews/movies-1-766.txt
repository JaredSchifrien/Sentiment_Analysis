Like most of M. Night Shalyman's films, boring, predictable, and unscary. It had me wondering how anyone would waste their hard earned cash on dreck like this. Bruce Willis gives his usuall less than steller preformance. How he is considered by some to be a great actor is beyond me. The one bright spot was the acting of Hayley Joel Osmet, who has a great future in pictures if he can avoid clunkers like this one.
