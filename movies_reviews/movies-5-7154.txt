National Lampoon's Vacation is a true comedy. I laughed all the way thru it...never a dull moment. Chevy Chase was hilarious, but the true star of this movie was obviously Beverly D'Angelo, an underrated actress who ALWAYS does a superb job in any movie role she takes on. Vacation makes you feel like you are actually on vacation from the real world for an hour and a half, and the ride isn't half bad. A great comedy that is already a classic...highly recommended....UPDATE- I would have to agree with GoneAway somewhat, I have felt like vacations I have been on have been just like this. Well not identical, but I have definately had some really bad vacations over the years...
