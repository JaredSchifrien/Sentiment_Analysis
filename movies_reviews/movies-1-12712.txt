I agree with everything Shroomwoman and BIG BABY said. Michael Moore presents an interesting problem: gun violence in America, and turns it into an illogical, immature, and destructive mockumentary. He lies, reports false information and uses deceipt on other human beings to promote his twisted view of our country. This film is dangrous to young minds.
