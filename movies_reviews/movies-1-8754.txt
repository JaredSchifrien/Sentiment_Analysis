This movie was HORRIBLE!!!Drew's character Lucy had to live the SAME day over and over until she died!!!Also,the movie was more about that than her relationship with Adam Sandler!!!What was Drew thinking by making this GODAWFUL film!!!"Doppelganger-The Evil Within" was BETTER than this SLOP!!!Hasn't Drew been torchered ENOUGH?!!!Those of you who haven't seen this film,but want to;take my advice:DON'T!!!!See "The Wedding Singer" INSTEAD!!!'Cause believe me,it's a MUCH better film than this one!!!
