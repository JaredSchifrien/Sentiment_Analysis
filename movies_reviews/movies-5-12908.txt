This is my favorite movie of all time. I own the DVD and have watched it maybe 25 times. My family laughs and makes fun on me when I watch it. I ve never really been able to determine what draws me to it. I have noticed that there are no women characters in the movie other than incidental (the opening scenes where his wife is shown, some of the jury, the last parole board has a representative, the board house woman and the grocery store), thus all the interaction of any substance is between men. This is not what I usually watch. Somehow the isolation and introspection by the characters seems important. I usually have plot criticisms of movies such as when characters do things that are nonsensical, something requires 1000-to-one odds to work and works, or cars roll over and there is a small nuclear detonation to enhance a scene. But the plot in SR is flawless. I ll read some more of the reviews.
