Not a perfect movie, but one that finally shows Gus van Sant besting his great 1989 film (debut?) Drugstore Cowboy. Forrester has the same gritty style of movie-making (and a great Miles Davis-dominated soundtrack), but this time it's wrapped around an uplifting story of a supremely gifted black teenager and his discovery as a legendary mentor. Sure, the story is quite improbable and it glosses over A LOT... but Connery and Rob Brown are both excellent, so you wind up WANTING to forgive the plot lapses and hoping for the predictable ending. In a weak year for movies, I left this one thinking it was worth the trip.
