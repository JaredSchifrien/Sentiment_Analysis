SHAFT....! It took balls for these people to make another Shaft movie. Richard Roundtree did a pretty kewl job on the last one. Samuel L. managed to get away with doing a splendid job after all. however. Pertaining to too much Violence as has been mentioned in other comments here...the real world of crimals is little else but,.. Violence . Perhaps this motion picture merely points out just how bad things have really gotten in the big cities and that's just the way it is. Not approving here or dis-approving....only pointing out a harsh reality that Shaft has to deal with in the real world. Shaft Kicked Butt...!
