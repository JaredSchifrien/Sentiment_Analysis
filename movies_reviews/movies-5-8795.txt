I loved this movie, and I laughed the entire time. Have you ever seen a man with two left feet? No, I mean TWO LEFT FEET! It is outrageously funny, and if you want to see the other side of the most famous American dog show, this is the show. Because of the sexual humor, you may not want to bring your mother-in-law...This irreverent movie makes fun of humans and dogs alike.
