I've seen this movie at least six times over the years, and it *still* makes me laugh every time. There aren't many jokes that misfire, and even things that could seem like outdated humor, such as those about Kareem Abdul-Jabaar's pilot character Roger (I think you're the greatest, but my Dad says you don't play hard enough), are still very funny because of the ludicrous situation and setup that remain timeless.
