'Charade' is one fantastic movie, and yet it is very underrated. Watching this movie, the viewers are treated to great visuals and to great acting. And what a cast: Audrey Hepburn, Cary Grant, James Coburn, Walter Matthau, and George Kennedy. Finally, this movie is suspenseful from beginning until end (reminiscent of a Hitchcock flick), as Hepburn's widowed Regina Lambert doesn't know who to turn to for help. If anyone cares to watch this movie, I promise they will not be disappointed.
