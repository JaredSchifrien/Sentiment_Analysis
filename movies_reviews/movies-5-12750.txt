Being propaganda doesn't make it false. Besides, people who were voting for Kerry were going to, movie or not. And republicans are very dense and stubborn - their vote is more about beating liberals than it is the betterment of the country. No facts or propaganda could change their mind. They don't care if Bush is a liar. So, who cares? Good movie.)))))))) ))))))))UPDATE. And they KNOW Bush is a liar. They don't care, people. It's like Ben Affleck's sister saying 'Gigli' was good. She knows it sucked, but she'll be damned if she is going to givwe critics the pleasure. Deep down they all know he is the worst president in history. They go to bed thinking about it. But if you say it to them, they will defend him at all cost. Come on, even republicans are not that stupid. They know. It's so obvious. ALL THE LIVING GREAT MINDS AGREE. I think it's a shame that folks voted for Bush, thus throwing our country away, basically, literally for spite. Damn shame. We will fall, just like Rome, and historians in the future will look upon this administration's run as the turning point. Naturally, republicans will dismiss this comment, like the stubborn morons they are. That's the problem - nobody will open their minds. THINK PEOPLE! Trust me, THAT is what Jesus wants.)))))))))))))))))UPDATE Being against the war is the most support one can give the troops. If I was there, I would feel more supported by the people who wanted me to come home and NOT DIE. I would feel less supported by the people on the right, and the administration that said, casualties are irrelevant right now.
