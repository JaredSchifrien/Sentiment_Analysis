This is a funny short movie. The claymation was great. It is wonderful how many great things that you can do with clay especially how Nick Park does this. I like Gromit the best and how the penguin drove him out of the house and messed with the electronic doggie walker trousers and used them to steal a diamond from the museum. Very cute and funny.
