This film is well developed. The actors are very well suited for their roles and play them very well. The courtroom scenes are well crafted, and the struggle for justice is briliantly portrayed. This movie boldly looks at some of the most hated points of American History, and displays some of the greatest pieces of American ideology. Freeman and Hopkins play excellent supporting roles, but the stars really bring out the struggle and victory.
