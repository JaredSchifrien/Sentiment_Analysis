This movie freaked me out as a kid. The music by John Williams really adds to the mood. It makes it more suspenseful since the shark isn't shown until 1 hr 20 min into the movie! Speilberg did excellent directing this movie and Scheider, Dreyfull, and Shaw helped make this movie into a classic film that will be viewed for many generations.
