This is one of my all-time favorite movies, but as Irishgit says, this is not a feel-good movie and so is not for everyone. Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight are street people who form an unlikely team. The movie is packed with affecting scenes, like the one where Hoffman and Voight are caught stealing food at a chic party. Instead of calling the cops, the hosts merely ask them why they are trying to make off with the food, instead of merely helping themselves like the other guests. The end of the movie is heartbreaking.
