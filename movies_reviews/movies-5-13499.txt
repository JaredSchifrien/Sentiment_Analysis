Such a great movie, excellent acting and a universal story. I really enjoyed the narrating and looking back aspect of the film. An excellent and somehow soul searching adventure of these best friends. Of course, since it was based on a Stephen King novella, there had to be that morbid flare (their entire journey occurs because they are in search of the dead kid's body) However, even that aspect played a key part in the movie. That kid who played Gordy did a superb job of acting..the look on his face as he took that leach the size of a small mammal from inside of his underwear was priceless.
