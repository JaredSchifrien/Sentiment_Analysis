Working Girl has got to be the worst Harrison Ford movie ever made. The movie is like listening to girl talk for 2 straight hours. It's like the designing women movie. The plot is simple: Sigourney Weaver is a mean and greedy boss of a man and a woman, and the woman is Griffith in her mindless role.
