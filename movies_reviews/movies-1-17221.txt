I SO wish there was a rating below one star. My kind husband brought this movie home to me after I mentioned I would like to see it. I was looking forward to snuggling in early and watching some of my favorite actors and actresses. I was also looking forward to laughing a great deal. Suffice it to say the movie was a complete joke, one that was not funny in the least, however. I have no idea who talked these skilled actors into participating in this movie, but they should have given their salaries back to pay the production company to burn the film. It's not worth renting, trust me.
