The first of Dashiell Hammett's Thin Man stories to be shown on screen. This one is the best and it won't disappoint any classic movie fan. The movie stars William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles. He used to be a detective and she is his wealthy wife. They spend most of the time inembriated, and a soused William Powell is a very funny one. Nick is asked by a young woman to help her when her father becomes the top suspect in a murder case. William Powell and Myrna Loy are a delight to watch and they have excellent chemistry together.
