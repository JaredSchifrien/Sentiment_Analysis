Set it back 500 years and this is the stuff of Shakespeare. The detailed story of Neil McCauley (Robert DeNiro), trying to run a robbery while dealing with a psychopath who was once in his gang, and Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), the cop who will do anything to stop him. By far Michael Mann's best film, this complicated film with so many details, so many stories, is powerhouse stuff. Not to mention the cast! DeNiro, Pacino, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Ashley Judd - - if you haven't seen this film you can't call yourself a movie fan. The whole film pulls you in, and it has the best bank robbery scene I've seen. See Heat now. Summary: A COMPLICATED POWERHOUSE FILM THAT PULLS YOU IN.
