Cruise is good in this film but this is definitely Dustin Hoffman at his very finest. He creates for us a sweet little character trapped inside his own mind and as harmless and likeable as small puppy. In the process we also get a rare look into the world of autism and the frustrations family members and caregivers can come to feel. This is a movie with heart and soul - the tale of two brothers and coming to terms with emotions and situations you can t change. My favorite Raymond Babbitz moment is when he is standing in the gigantic window in the Las Vegas hotel room and looking out on all the lights. The shot is wide and from the back and Hoffman looks very small and alone. With his head tilted to one side he quietly says, Very sparkly, very twinkly. That to me summed up Raymond Babbitz very sparkly, very twinkly, and very much alone. What a great film.
