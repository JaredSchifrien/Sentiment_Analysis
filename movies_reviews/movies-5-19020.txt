Creepshow is a little collection of horror stories that are put together into a movie. There are three mini stories, Father's Day, Something to Tide You Over, and The Crate. Father's Day is mediocre. That one is pretty predictable. The other two are completely original. Something to Tide You Over is like a Tales From the Crypt episode. My favorite is The Crate, which is about some monster who is realeased from a crate. Creepshow failed in thier attempt to re-make Tales From the Crypt, but collection is horror films will give you a scary and fun time!
