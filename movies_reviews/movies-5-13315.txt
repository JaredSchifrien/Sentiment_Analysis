I don't know if I give this drama a rating of five stars in honor of Siskel and Ebert or in honor of my Government teacher, Mr. Berry, who would give it two thumbs down for its ability to evoke memories he'd rather supress. So five stars for its excellent effects, its emotional draw, its sense of reality, but five stars backwards from the ex-Vietnam solider who couldn't sit through the entire thing without gagging. So real was the stench of death drifting back into his nostrils. Five stars for the power of the film making.
