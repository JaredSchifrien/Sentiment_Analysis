Not many actors could pull off being on screen for a major potion of a movie alone, and make it interesting and belieavable, but Tom Hanks pulls it off wonderfully. One of the great acting challenges of our time, and Tom Hanks lives up to expectations. He gives an Oscar-worthy performance, and propably would have won had he not already captured two other awards earlier in his career His co-star, Wilson, really stole the show and became the star everybody loves. Helen Hunt did her best in what essentially was a throw-away role, a role that was poorly written. Her photo in the locket was the real preformance here. Still, CASTAWAY remains one of IJR's favorite flicks and IJR says check it out!!
