This is quite simply one of the worst movies of all time. The plot is not well contrived, nor the story set properly. The characters and scenes are very surrealistic, almost to the point of existentialism, and the humorous portions of the film are rather transparent. The story is very predictable, and the special effects, mediocre. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone, and while Chris Tucker was funny, he was also tedious and unnecessary. Additionally, the love story was thin, and under developed while Gary Oldman was just stupid: so much so, that I believe his performance in Lost in Space was better than this one.
