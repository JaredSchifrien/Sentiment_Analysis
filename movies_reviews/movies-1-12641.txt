My word to describe this movie: UNNECESSARY. Between what is truly entertaining and what is a pure waste of time, there is a line. Kinsey crossed it. Definitely a waste of time. I was interested at first because of the sweet honest romance Kinsey and his wife shared and their naivity about sex. It was cute. But the remainder of the movie took a beautiful thing and shat (is that a word?) all over it. My image of Lliam Neeson is forever ruined.
