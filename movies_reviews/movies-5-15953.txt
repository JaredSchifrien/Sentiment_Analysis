I give this movie five stars because I believe that it's difficult to adapt a movie from a real story. It can sometimes lack the feeling that the original situation had. I think that this movie was well done. I know that a lot of work was put into it. They even went so far as to find hockey players to act in this movie who as closely as possible resembled the original team. During the on-ice scenes, cameramen were right with the players, shooting the scenes. The original plays of the original games were even completely re-enacted and I think that deserves some credit.
