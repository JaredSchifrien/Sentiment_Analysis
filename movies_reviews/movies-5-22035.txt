This was the only film I've ever seen where people left the theater to go to the bathroom only to watch the remainder of the movie from a safe distance behind the safety of the porthole-like circular window just outside of the theater. I went to the bathroom (very fast. . .I didn't want to miss anything) I passed these few people watching ALIENS through the porthole. Are you going back in? I asked. They shook their heads and said it was too scary. This was the greatest sci-fi experience I will ever have at the movie theater. ALIENS is still awesome on DVD, but you had to be there. . .anyone else have a story like this? Also represents James Cameron at his artistic apex- His TITANIC days have made him highly annoying.
