Even though this movie is too cute for my tastes, Robin Williams is in top form. I honestly don't think he's topped this performance since this movie came out. He ad-libs so well here that it feels like part of the script. I actually saw this twice in the theater and laughed just as hard the second time around. Groundhog Day is still the funniest movie of the 90s, but this one is close.
