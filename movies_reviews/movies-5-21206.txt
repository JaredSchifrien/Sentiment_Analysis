This movie is a tour de force. John Cameron Mitchell portrays Hedwig, a German-born transexual who becomes a down and out and then up and coming rock star in an unforgettable performance. Miriam Shor is also great in her supporting role as Hedwig's husband(?) and band mate, as well as Michael Pitt as Tommy Gnosis, Hedwig's protege-turned-nemesis. And the music (written by Stephen Trask and performed by the actual actors) rocks... BIG TIME. The story and characters are among the most unique and creative in recent cinema, and it also features animated sequences that are at times sweet and at times odd and provocative. There is tremendous humor, dark, dry and otherwise, and a deeply felt message that we must look to ourselves rather than to others to become complete. Look for this film to join Tommy and Rocky Horror Picture Show as one of the greatest and most subversive rock musicals of all time. The soundtrack cd is well worth your investment as well.
