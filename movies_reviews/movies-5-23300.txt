Not quite as good as 2,3, and 4, but certainly better than the rest of the Trek movies. This is the last of the Passing the Torch trilogy (6,7,8) and the first all-TNG feature. And it has everything: adventure, suspence, comedy, drama; an absolutely fun Trek movie all the way through. (Epcharles, your review's misplaced --heh)
