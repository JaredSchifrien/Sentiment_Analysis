This was a really great movie. I've seen it a million times and I still like it. I'm not really a fan of romantic sort of movies, but this one I liked. It's a bit of a chick flick, but it's a good one. It even has a bit of humour in it despite the movie being about a horrible tragedy. It's a long movie, but it is a good one.
