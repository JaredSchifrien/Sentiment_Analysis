I remember seeing my mother closing a book just after she had finished it. Misty-eyed she said to herself, Now that is a great story! It was Gone With the Wind. I decided to read the book and I found it great. Then the movie came along as a re-release (back in the early 70's when they still did that sort of thing)The movie wasn't exactly like the book, but it was still a great film experience for me. It was filmed during the height of Hollywood's golden era and there was a perfect character actor for each role. Will that ever happen again? GWTW is an eternal classic and Vivien Leigh deservedly won that best actress Oscar, As God as my witness...I'll never be hungry again! During the Atlanta fire, I swear I could feel the heat on my face while sitting there in that theatre!
