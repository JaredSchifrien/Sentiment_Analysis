For me the film show us how damaging prison-life is for human beings! Like in Andy Dufresne's example: He starts being a criminal in the prison! No of the character in Shawshank who get a new chance outside the prisonwall, become really free! Maybe prisonlife isn't the right way to punish human beings?
