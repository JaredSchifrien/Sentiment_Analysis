A definate must-have if they put it out on dvd...I can remember being spooked by the scene in the tunnel where they're on the paddle boat...(I was just a wee one when it came out.) I'm in my 30's now and watch it with MY kids every chance I get, they love the Oompla-Loompas, watching Violet Beauregard blow up, and guessing the exact moment when the glass elevator will break through the ceiling. If you want to view paradise, simply look around and view it...
