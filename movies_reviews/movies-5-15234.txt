This is an absolutely fantastic film that was made in 1975. it stars Al Pacino as the main character Sonny - he's trying to rob a bank helped by his friend Sal in order to pay for his male lovers sex change. He had everything planned out (or so he thought) until he finds out that the money had already been removed before he had got there. So he decides to hold the bank clerks and manager hostage and the situation becomes desperate. The local police, led by Sergeant Moretti (Charles Dunning) try to get the situation under control, but because of Sonny's charisma, the general public who are outside support Sonny and the whole thing becomes a media circus. You do feel yourself willing Sonny and Sal to be ok and to live happily ever after, especially when Sonny's wife and male lover become involved and you think they are going to get away with it. But it ends so tragically. This is a timeless film and really shows Al Pacino's magnificance as an actor and the script is amazing. If you are a fan of Al Pacino and you haven't seen this, I urge you to.
