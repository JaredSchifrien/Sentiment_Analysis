So chill. I don't know if I was just in the right mood at the right time or what it was but I was one of the few people in the theatre who really enjoyed it. The soundtrack is excellent, the plot is... well, rather simple, and though it is not consistently laugh-out loud hilarious, the humor is very dry, very wry and very funny. A wistful modern masterpiece.
