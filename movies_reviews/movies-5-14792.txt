I really enjoyed Chocolat. The movie is about a woman ( Vianne, played by Juliette Binoche) and her daughter who move to a small, provincial town in France and open a chocolate shop. The town's mayor is not pleased with Vianne and what he thinks she represents, and he attempts to sabotage her. The story develops nicely, with several interesting sub-plots, and the acting is terrific. I'm not surprised in the least that Juliette Binoche was nominated for Best Actress for her role in this movie. Johnny Depp and Judi Dench are both great, too. Although the movie deals mostly with relationships, it moves at a good pace and is never boring. If you're looking for a nice movie without a lot of violence or sleaze, Chocolat would be a good choice. I suggest arming yourself with a bar of chocolate before entering the theater...
