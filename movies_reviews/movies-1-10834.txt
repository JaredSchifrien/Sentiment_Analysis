It is on my list of Ten Worst movies I've ever saw (or in this case slept through). It had all the suspense of a half-hearted game of Clue Jr., the story was meandering and wearisome, and the sound quality of the DVD, coupled with the bad British accents made most of the movie sound mushy and inaudible. It was so painfully boring that we rented it for a whole week and popped it in our DVD player 4 nights and fell in and out of repose all week. By the time I woke up for the ending where they reveal whodunit, I commented, I don't even know who they f--k got killed, and angrilly went back to sleep. I don't dig Robert (I hate America) Altman movies. I don't understand why every big-time actor has to make an appearance in an Altman movie. Must be some coastal elite Blue States liberal thing.
