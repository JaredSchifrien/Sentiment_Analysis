As a 29 year-old (straight) male who owns his share of punk rock CDs, I'm thoroughly embarrassed by my love for this movie. Every once in a while I'll get its songs stuck in my head. Especially that yodelling one that they use during the puppet show. But there's really not a weak spot to the whole movie (except that one song that Maria sings when she's on her way from the convent to the Von Trapps).
