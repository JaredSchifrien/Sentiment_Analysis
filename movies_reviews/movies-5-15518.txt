The first time I went to see Titanic at the theatre, I had bought one of those 32 oz fountain drinks. I was so engulfed in the movie that I hardly drank any of my drink, and in the last 30 minutes of the movie, the bottom of my cup fell out and spilled all over my lap ! But the movie was so good I sat there in the soda and finished watching it. I can say no movie has ever touched me this much to put up with that..lol. But in any event, I went to see the TITANIC the next weekend without any accidents, and I loved it the 2nd time as well. I have seen it several times since then at home, and still never get tired of it. This is one of 2 movies that I actually loved to see Leo DiCaprio star in. The first being Gilbert Grape. I still don't have any idea how he pulled it off. I also love the theme song by Celine Dion. Excellent film and soundtrack ! I recommend the movie to all families !
