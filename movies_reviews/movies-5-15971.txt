This film was EXCELLENT. If you like abstract films then you'll love this one. Shot on Digital Video, it was so strange when you saw the settings of the village. It was on a big stage and the homes were designed like an architect's plan of a house, with no doors and limited props. The film's theme's itself related to greed, disregard and disrespect for human life. Nicole Kidman was extremely brave to take part in this film and the performances all round were brilliant, very brave filmaking indeed.
