I absolutely loved this movie. A great story about caring for another. I also found myself laughing alot throughout the whole thing. Like when Kenai first gets his totem. The bear of love? ...Does anyone wanna trade? x) I really don't see what people don't like about this movie. I'm a huge Lion King fanatic, yet people say that it was a pathetic attempt to be the next TLK. It's got an outstanding soundtrack, (I had to go buy it right away after the theater release) cute characters, a beatiful plotline - it's really just an amazing movie. I couldn't help but cry at the end because it's so sweet, and if you don't know what I'm talking about, I suggest you go rent the DVD right away ^^
