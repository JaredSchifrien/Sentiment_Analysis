This movie was INTENSE. But never abused cheap tactics, explosions, or cheezy romantic dialogue. It's dialogue, in fact, is probably second only to Pulp Fiction in quality and humor. We see the perfect crime go horibly and tragically awry without ever seeing it happen. Even though the main players are all cold-blooded killers, in their plight, we find sympathy, and actually care about what happens to them. These are the markings of a good film.
