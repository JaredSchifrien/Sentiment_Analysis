I worship this movie. I worship Stanley Kubrick, the great artist who made this masterpiece. I worship the sense of ridiculous, cold irony that permeates every second of it. I worship George C. Scott as Buck Turgidson, who is the single funniest person in the film. And everything else in this film, I worship as well. A seriously funny movie. Hysterical, but with a deep, dark, cynical message. A satire for the ages. One of the greatest films ever made.
