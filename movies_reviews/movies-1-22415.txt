The nifty special effects could not save the horrendous acting. George Lucas has finally lost his mind. There was no good performance. Even Christopher Lee couldn't deliver the join the dark side speech in a way that didn't sound exactly like the first one from Vader. The crowning achievement in this horrible travesty of a film was Skywalker Sr. goes to rescue his mother. I literally was crying with laughter when she looked up into her son's eyes, just barely holding onto life, and says Ani? Is that you? Oh, you're so handsome. What is this? A visit to Grandma's? Just a perfectly awful film. The only parts I enjoyed were the parts when there was no dialogue to ruin it.
