James Whale was certainly a God-send. I truly believe that he is one of the most influential directors ever. Never has a film been so expectedly scary while at the same time unexpectedly funny! Bride pulls it off with great precision, and only the talents of Whale could have made the film so brilliantly. To this day, I belive Bride of Frankenstein to be the greatest of all horror films.
