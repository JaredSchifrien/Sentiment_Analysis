When first watching this movie, afficionados often ask themselves, What's so great about 'Citizen Kane'? But 'Citizen Kane' deserves its lofty perch in the annals of moviedom for several reasons in that it took several risks in being created. It was no secret that Orson Welles's classic was a thinly-veiled account on the life of multi-millionaire publisher and yellow journalism extraordinaire, William Randolph Hearst. Hearst tried to stop the making of this movie with threats and went so far as to not allow any advertising on it in any newspaper (and possibly costing 'Citizen Kane' an Oscar). Secondly, the cinematography was innovative in that much of the movie was shot at (at the time) unorthodox angles. Orson Welles sought to show his characters in both a physical and emotional perspective. Thirdly, 'Citizen Kane' did something unimaginable at the time: its beginning was actually its end. From Kane's deathbed scene in which he utters Rosebud, the movie is a recounting of events by Kane's co-operatives that gives clues to the identity of Rosebud. In effect, this was the first interactive movie where the audience is treated to a What is it? type of inquiry. The movie is arguably the greatest ever, and confirmed the then twenty-five year old Orson Welles's monniker as the 'Boy Genius'.
