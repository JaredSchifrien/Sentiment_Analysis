Update; having seen this excellent film, the soul-love portrayed transcends the sexes of the people involved, and takes us on a human journey of love that, through fear of society's constraints (not God's)they are unable to naturally express. To conform, they get married and in the process hurt more people, yet not so much as they are hurting themselves. A film through which you will experience the depth of their love and understand that love is greater than the two protaganists.Superbly acted. Norainbows, if you didn't understand it, you've got a problem. Not only has this film won the top prizes at Cannes and Venice but the Film Critics and Reviewer's Top Award. It sounds a cracking good film and can't wait to see it. For those who think it's just a gay film..well, above all, it's a love film and for those who think it's misrepresentative of cowboys, what do you think went on when guys were up in those mountains on their own? Louie: King Kong! My fears are confirmed that you have a lot of growing up to do, Louie.
