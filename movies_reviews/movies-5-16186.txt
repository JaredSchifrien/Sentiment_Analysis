Great flick. Daniel Day Lewis was incredible in this movie. I liked how the movie's plots were on such a grand level (civil war, politics, gangs, immigration) all while in a tiny setting of about 1 or 2 blocks: great juxtapositioning. Also, I liked how Leonardo's friend in the movie was Eliot from ET!!
