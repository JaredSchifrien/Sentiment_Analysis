I loved National Treasure! I went to see it with my dad for my last brithday, and we both laughed through it. It's very well done, and actually has an interesting story line. Nicholas Cage did a great job, as did the other actors, and actresses, and I highly reccomend this movie to anyone who wants an adventure.
