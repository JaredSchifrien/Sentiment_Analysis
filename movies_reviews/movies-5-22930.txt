 I would not go as far as to call this film Kubrick's masterpeice but it is by far one of his most note worthy accomplishments. A very exciting and thoughtful movie about a strange and equally beautiful and ugly future not too far from ours. Being the story of a boy whose principal interests are rape,ultra-violence and Beehtoven. is the stinger sentence to the poster and is the summation of the film. It is about a young boy named Alex who lives in this above mentoned future where the laws of earth aren't really paid much attention to because everyone is focused on living in outer space. He enjoys hanging out with the droogies and beating,raping and drinking milk laced with narcotics. Until one night he is caught. You have to see this classic to believe what happens. Watch for the 2001:A Space Oddessy record in the store. Highly recommended.
