I love Barbra Hershey. In this movie, you have to feel for her charactor. The movie is based on a true story, which means they took a police report, witness statements, plantiff testimony, etc., and blew it out of proportion to make the movie. They did outstanding at it. Truly scary at times..... think about it. How would it feel to be raped by a ghost and have no way to prove it????
