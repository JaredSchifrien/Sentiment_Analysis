This movie was better than the first. Woody gets kidnapped only to find out that he was the main star of Woody's Roundup He meets Jessie and the other characters from Woody's Roundup. Now he has to choose if he wants to be with his owner or his new friends. This movie also has great songs and a few take offs from movies like Star Wars.
