At last, a film that the British movie indusrty can be proud of. We certainly wasn't expecting it to be popular in America. The film has a fantastic plotline, amazing music and some of the scenes take your breath away. It was very strange seeing London without any people or traffic there, especially since I live in London. The action is kept up very well and the fact that the entire film was shot in digital makes a noticable difference, especially when it is raining. The DVD is good as well as you can see the alternative endings and documentaries. Bloody fantastic.
