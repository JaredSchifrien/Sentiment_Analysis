Office Space doesn't have the best plot in the world, but boy is it funny. If you've ever worked in a cubicle filled office, or are a software engineer, this movie is perfect for a laugh. Office Space reminds me a lot of Dilbert. If you like the comics, you will probably enjoy the same humor of Office Space. I don't know how many times my friends and I have quoted the great lines of this movie ( Sounds like someone has a case of the Mondays ) while at work, but it's probably too many to count. The characters in this movie are hilarious, especially Michael Bolton the software engineer ( There was nothing wrong with my name until I was about 12-years-old and that no-talent ass clown became famous and starting winning Grammies ) and Mr. Lumburg the boss. You have to watch this movie several times to really enjoy it and pick up all the great lines. The movie deserves more attention than it got, but it has a lot of no-name actors in it (except for Jennifer Aniston). A must have for your comedy collection.
