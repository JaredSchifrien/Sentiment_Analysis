best movie ever, really. it makes you actually FEEL GOOD, it showcases a bunch of actors (except for Frances McDormand) that you really didn't think had such great performances in them, but they truly do. Kate Hudson is a guaranteed oscar winner, her face that graces the cover and steals every scene is priceless.
