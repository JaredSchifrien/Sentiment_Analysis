Despite GoneAway and Gentle Jude's dismissal (without even having read the books or seen the movie, but based on a rumour that they promote withcraft and satanism and things like that (which we all know is not true. Most of us were already into that stuff before the books came out!))of all things Potter, the movie is fantastic. It stays to the book as much as possible, and is a nice visual introduction to the world of Harry Potter. The casting was damn near perfect, and you can really believe that Daniel, Rupert, and Emma ARE really Harry, Ron, and Hermione. THe Quidditch scene is visually breathtaking. Great special effects throughout make for one great movie. IJR says don't listen to GoneAway, and check this one out for yourself if you want a movie the whole family can enjoy.
