One of the most charming films I've seen in quite a while. Featuring an all-star British cast that includes Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson and may others, it's a romantic comedy centered around Christmas. Delightful and hilarious, it explores the complicated relationships of many couples from new love to old love to impossible love. But in the end, as the title suggests, it's all about love. It's undeniably sweet and actually honest. It leaves you with a smile and a warm spot in your heart.
