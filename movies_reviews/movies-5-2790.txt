Great film. Norton did an EXCELLENT job when he played the spazzy Brian. I felt a bit deceived by the billing though. Angela Bassett was touted as a major player in the film, but she was little more than a prop. I mean the story could have been just effecitve without her. She was very under-used. Age and treachery will overcome youth and inexperience.
