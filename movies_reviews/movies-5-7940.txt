A really really good film. In my opinion its not really a comedy because there are few out and out laughs in it, except for Chris Elliott. But its a fantasy, where Murray has to repeat the same day over and over again until he becomes a better person. And it takes him quite a while to do that. Its an enjoyable ride to watch him change, little by little.
