The perfect vehicle for Jack Nicholson and his most memorable performance, bar none. He simply is Randell P. McMurphy, the only one who dares to question the authority of the powers that be (mainly Louise Fletcher who plays the villainess, Nurse Ratched) in the state mental hospital where the convicted child molester McMurphy is hiding out from the manual labor jobs visited upon him in the "real" prison. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll live and die with the disturbed con-artest played by Nicholson, who, in reality, appears to be much better adjusted than the staff and volunteer patients that share his wing in the psychiatric center.
