I loved it! I loved the idea! Imagine living your whole life(using the bathroom, masturbating, digging your noise, taking a crap), not knowing that the rest of the world is watching you too. The idea that there is someone controlling your environment and you are just a guinea pig in some aliens experiment or something, is scary. It's kind of like the Matrix. Way cool.
