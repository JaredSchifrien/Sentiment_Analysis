Well, just call me simple and dull but I liked this movie. I just got a kick out of the sweet character finding himself in so many experiences and he never realized how diverse these things were. I also loved his attitude of never thinking he was more than he was. What in the world can be wrong with a story of a sweet, kind man in some extremely funny and sometimes sad moments.
