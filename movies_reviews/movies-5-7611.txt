This is one of the very best mainstream movies produced in the last ten years. I've seen it five times now, and every time I see it I like it more (it's rare for me to watch a movie more than twice). The music is incredible, the characters are sympathetic, accessible, and oftentimes hilarious, and the script is well-written. That scene at the end with the nooses and the men digging the graves, singing Lonesome Valley gives me goose bumps.
