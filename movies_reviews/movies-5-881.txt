There is drama, suspense, and horror film, all in one movie. Great acting from the stars, especially the little boy. The twisted ending makes the movie something to talk about. The movie doesn't drag, and it makes the viewer aware of the world around him\her. Great, great storyline which is diverse for everyone.
