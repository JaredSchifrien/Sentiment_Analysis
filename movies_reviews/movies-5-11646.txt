Well...I just went to go see this movie today and I must say this is histerical!!! It is a must see...The movie is about America's most loved couple breaking ^ and the people not liking them as much b/c they are not together.Then someone has been hired to try and bring them back together, but the movie brings surprises and great entertainment so go c it!! The actors and actresses in it are as follows: Julia Roberts, Billy Christal, John Cusack, and Catherine Zeta Jones...Oh and the adorable Seth Green is in it toooooo!!!!Catherine Zeta Jones and John Cusack are the famous couple that split ^...and Julia Roberts is the sister of Catherine Zeta Jones, and Billy Christal is the man hired to get them back together and Seth Green is Billy Chrystal's assistant....it is very cute!! Did yall know that Julia Roberts was offered the part as Gwen, Catherine Zeta Jones' part. Oh and if u have seen the movie or the previews the parts w/ the dogs by Billy Christal's crotch...wasn't suppose ta be in the movie....and in my opinion was the funniest part..heheehe it is sooo great u hvae to c it..i highly recommend it!!! : )
