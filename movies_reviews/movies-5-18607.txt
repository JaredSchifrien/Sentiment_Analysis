One of the most original horror movies ever made. Evil Dead was Sam Raimi's first big movie and served him very well. A group of friends rent a nasty old cabin for a weekend but over night it turns into a blood bath after the demon resurection passages from The Necronomicon are resighted and The Evil Dead and its deadites are unleashed. Out of the Evil Dead trilogy, this is the best horror movie. Don't excpect the cute jokes and Bruce Campbell's witty one liners, this is really a horror movie. It is actually very effective in its grotesquness and shock value. When I first saw it I had no idea it was going to be as gory and sick as it was! A great beggining to a great trilogy. Not many trilogys keep their mojo up for the entire series, but Evil Dead does an incredible job of it. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU AND YOUR BEST MATES!
