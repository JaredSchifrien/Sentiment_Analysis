not the best troma movies, but definately one of the better ones. this movie is really funny, and it had a lot of really far out, original stuff that only the sick, genius mind of lloyd kauffman could dream up. as for the acting and effects go , well, its definately troma. a must see, troma classic, i mean how can you say you have lived if you havent seen the toxic avenger?
