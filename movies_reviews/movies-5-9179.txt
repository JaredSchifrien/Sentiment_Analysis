a great film all around. when the film started i was wondering what would happen if malkovich went into his own portal. i didnt think it would happen but he did. the scene after is amazing as is the scene in his subconcious. an instant classic, one of my favorites, a must see for anyone who is looking for something different. the ending is awesome, i wont spoil it for anyone who hasnt seen it. no doubt that this is a 5 out of 5.
