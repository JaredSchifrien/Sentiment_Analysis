I loved it. Where else can you see life prtrayed through the eyes of a house. It's the story of a dying man, and his messed up life. Or it's the story of a messed up man and his dying house. Or it's the story of a man with a messed up family and the growth of the family right along with the growth of his house. Or, it's all of those, or it's none of those. It's just a great movie. Even if you're a guy who doesn't cry, bring the Kleenex along for this one. Nobody's eyes will stay dry.
