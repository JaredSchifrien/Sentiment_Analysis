I stalled in renting this movie, but now that I finally broke down and watched it, I'm glad I did. The acting was strong and believable, I could relate to the characters and the scenery was gorgeous. Diane Lane was wonderful as Frances -- when she cried, I cried with her. And the footage was extraordinary; it made me want to hop on the next plane to Tuscany and buy a rundown villa in the middle of nowhere. If you like romantic comedies that are actually true-to-life, I suggest this one!
