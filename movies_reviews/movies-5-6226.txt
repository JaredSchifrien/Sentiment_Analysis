Great movie. Still modern. Seems to encapsulate the appeal of love on the run with the wrong people, and of creating your own community. Like a modern Robin Hood. Again, sex (or the lack of it) plays an important, though subtle, part in this 60s flick. You find yourself rooting for them, but not totally, which is a brilliant manipulation on the part of the actors.
