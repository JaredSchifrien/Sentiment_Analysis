A classic. People talk about sixth sense having a great surprise ending, but I think that it pales in comparison to the horror on Charlton Heston's face when he realized the truth about the Planet of the Apes. Great flick - and who was the actress who played his mute companion? She may be one of the only actresses from any old movie who I think is smoking hot by today's standards.
