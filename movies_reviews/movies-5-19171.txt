I saw this film when I was ten years old and it literally frightened the crap out of me! I couldn't take my eyes off of it no matter how full my pants got! (Just kidding!) This film has some of the best special effects I've seen on an cheesy eighties zombie flick. To those who have seen it: Wasn't that slimy zombie in the basement the most real and frightening thing in the movie? For those who haven't: If you're looking to be entertained and don't mind being grossed out a little, rent this film!! And, of course, let's not forget R.L.D. Pt.II! The sequel is almost as good as the first one and is, in my opinion, more comical!!
