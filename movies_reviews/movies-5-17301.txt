What I cannot believe is that this is just getting rated. This excellent film has been out now for over 2 years. As a father you should see this film and all of its passion that Roberto Bernini has put into it. You can even see a rarity on film a man and his real life wife acting together and just as passionate as off the silver screen. This film will make you cry and that is that (provided you have a heart).
