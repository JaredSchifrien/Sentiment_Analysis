This is a great movie, and I don't normally lavish praise on romantic comedies. The reason for that is, they are usually not very romantic and they are usually not very funny. This one is both. Turner and Douglas start out not being able to stand each other, but they eventually warm up. Meanwhile they, along with Danny Devito, are hot on the trail of a valuable gem. It leads them to many funny venues and circumstances.
