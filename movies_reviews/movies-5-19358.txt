Scream 2 was much better than the first film, as the first film got pretty predictable after the first half of the movie. However, this one was quite a shocker as I had no idea that either Mickey or Debbie Salt would be the killer. I suspected that Salt was maybe not who she said she was, but I never suspected that she would be Billy Loomis's mother. Overall, a good followup to the origional. A film very, very well done!
