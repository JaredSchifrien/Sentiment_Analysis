A great movie! Tom does it again. The wonderful tale of a man who comes here and is stripped of his nationality and money and is confined to JFK airport. A tribute to the immigrant, the character of those who come to this country and to those who remember what America really is. America does not promise success and riches equal to everyone else--it promises the opportunity and freedom to make the best for yourself (all dependent on how hard you'll work to succeed). A fair trade.
