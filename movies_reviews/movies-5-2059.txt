This movie almost made me piss my pants. More than once. But seriously, What Lies Beneath could be the scariest movie I've ever seen. When Pfeiffer turned into the decomposed girl in the bathtub as Ford was grabbing for her necklace! Holy Mother make it stop... Definitely worth seeing in the theater.
