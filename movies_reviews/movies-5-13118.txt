The movie was very well produced and showed us a piece of history that is very troublesome and should never be repeated. It showed how the Nazis and SS soldiers exterminated not only Jewish people but others that didn't fit in with their perfect race. It was a very emotional movie. Although this was based on an event that was evil, it showed people the destruction of the Holocaust in full force.
