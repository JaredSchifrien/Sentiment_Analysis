I just got back from this movie and it was worth my money. I hate to reveal much about the plot, but it contained drama and suspense (two elements that, I feel, make for a fine movie). It had me contemplating the current runnings of hospitals, the press, insurance agencies, police forces, etc... not to mention the unbreakable bond of love between parent and child.
