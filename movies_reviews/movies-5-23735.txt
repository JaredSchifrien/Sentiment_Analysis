This is a really good movie. I like Egypt a lot and know a lot about it and for the most part the Egyptian things in the movie are accurate. This movie is just as good as the first one, if not better. This is one of those movies that you have to see the first one to understand, so don't say that you won't see it just because you didn't see the first one. I think a thing they added very well was the parts of wars with the huge numbers represented very well. So I'd say go see it. For people that love Egypt like me it's a 5, for people that love action movies it's a 4, and for people that don't it's still probably a 3 and worth seeing.
