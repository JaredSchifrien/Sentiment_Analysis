This is perhaps one of the worst action movies of all time. First of all, it is so removed from the premise of the original Mission: Impossible series that people wouldn't even recognize it as a sequel were it not for the title. Second, the plot is as predictable as they come: a bad man wants to threaten the world with a virus and the hero has to stop him, plus the girl is in danger; give me a break. Third, there is a truckload of slow-mo action scenes that might look good in the first minutes, but then they become tiresome since the amount of them has to be seen to be believed. Fourth, the action scenes are so over-the-top as to be ridiculous: Hunt (Cruise) can avoid bullets and perform stunts so exhaggerated as to be utterly laughable. Fifth, the movie has so many plot holes and absurdities as to be completely irritating: whenever Hunt has to infiltrate the bad guys' team, he wears a mask and can impersonate anyone, even people who were never seen before, or who are taller or fatter, whatever. At one point, one of the bad guys is killed because Hunt makes him wear a mask of himself. Just imagine, Hunt was carrying a mask of HIMSELF! How's that for deus ex machina. And what about the virus that is transmitted through blood in certain scenes, then suddenly is supposed to be airborne 'cause otherwise the plot wouldn't work? Pathetic. Sixth, the movie copies left and right from superior movies; most of it is pale imitation of Bond movies, and the rest is taken from some Hitchcock's classics or superhero movies (yeah, Cruise is also so strong in this film that he could rival Superman). All in all Mission: Impossible II is one of the worst summer movies I've ever seen in my life, and should be avoided like the plague.
