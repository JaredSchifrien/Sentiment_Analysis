This movie is perhaps my favorite sci-fi/space type movie. The acting was incredible, and I loved the storyline, as well as the special effects. Props go to Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck. A great film! The plot went together perfectly, with comedy, drama, excitement and suspense all rolled into one. Great film!
