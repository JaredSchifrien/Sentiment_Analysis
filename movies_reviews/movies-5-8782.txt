One of the best of this ensemble groups work. A Mighty Wind is better, however. I've recommended this to a lot of friends. Also, I've had dogs all of my life, and I go to dog shows to people watch and to comfort some nervous canines. I go to horse shows to see the horses showing their asses to a bunch of horse's asses showing their horses.
