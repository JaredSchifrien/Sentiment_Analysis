This character driven drama gives insight into the inner working of Wall Street. It shows how, in an attempt to be successful, if you're not careful you can sellout your values for money. Thus, leaving you rich and successful, but empty. This movie illustrates the indifference of the capitalist system, how it can chew people up and ruin their lives because of the intense competition.
