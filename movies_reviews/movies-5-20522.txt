The first IMAX I ever saw and I was just completely mesmerized by the experience. I wonder why all movies aren't made this way. The scenery was amazing- we only learned about Antarctica in books, and only briefly. I was able to experience 1st hand what it really looked like, and it completely changed my view. The movie showed us the penguins that hopped around in their natural habitat instead of in a zoo. We got to see the polar bears playing around with the fish. It was truly picturesque. Gives you a much better sense of that icy continent.
