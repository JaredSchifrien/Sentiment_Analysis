This is one of those movies I will watch over and over. Such a great story of the value of human life and friendship..the cast was so perfect for the characters. The way Kathy Bates' character developed from a unself confident doormat into a person who learned to make her own happieness was fun to see. And I think we all know an Izzy out there somewhere!
