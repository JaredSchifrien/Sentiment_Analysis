sexystreif wouldn't know her a** from a hole in the ground. This is perhaps the most inspired, densely-packed comedy ever in film history! The Marx Bros are the greatest vaudeville comedy team of all-time, and this was their finest, a pure, all-comedy comedy! No filler whatsoever! Where do I begin? How about when they all dress up as Groucho in his bedgown? How about my glass of water? Ok, I give up - how about your glass of water? What about the mirror scene? If you didn't enjoy that, you don't know what comedy is! And the final battle scene is one of the funniest scenes I ever saw! It's also a great anti-war movie - a farce in the spirit of Strangelove and Great Dictator. Hands down, the Marx Bros are true comic legends, and this movie is why! One of my all-time greatest movies ever.
