Disney did it again. Anyone who liked the first Fantasia will love the second. It is an excellent mix of old and new and some great jazz added in. You really get into the storylines with the music. You feel for the whales and wish you could fly with them. You want to hug the little girl and tie up her terrible mother. My personal favorite- the flamingos. I have to say, and many people have agreed with me on this point, it's all about the flamingos!
