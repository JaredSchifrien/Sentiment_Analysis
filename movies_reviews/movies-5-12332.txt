Wow. In the tradition of Latin American or Guy Ritchie cinema...this movie is one of those films that brings it all together neatly but up until it does you are left waiting breathlessly. Great performances by all, esp. Cheadle, Bullock, Newton and Howard. A real plus to see Bullock be VERY unlikeable. A wonderful film to watch more than once.
