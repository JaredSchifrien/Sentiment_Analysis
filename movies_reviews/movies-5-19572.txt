The best thriller to come out in ages. I thought films like this had died out a long time ago. Joy Ride has proven me wrong. This film had me crouched in my chair and biting my nails through some of the coolest suspence filled moments I have ever experienced. I would go as far as to compare this to Hitchcock. A perfect blend of hard edged humor and heart pounding suspence and terror make this one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. A great cast and an original story as well as beautiful directing help to bring this film to full speed life. Steve Zahn is excellent as usual. Paul Walker prooves himself to be a fairly good action type and Leelee Sobeieski makes the most of a underwritten yet believable role. (Anyone else notice her High Beams are on in about every damn shot???) A Great film that relies on sheer terror rather than a bloody stump. Like the great Alfred Hitchcock once said, I want to torture my audience as much as possible. Believe me, you will be tortured in the most wonderful ways imaginable. Joy Ride deliverse the goods. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
