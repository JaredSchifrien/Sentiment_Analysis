And just what are some of you basing your opinions of this movie being historically incorrect? Were you all there during the events? The importance of the movie lies not in 100% accuracy, but in the real story of a young Nations' fight for independence. It shows the heart and soul of the men and women who sacrificed everything so you could live free today. With all the crap being generated in Hollywood today, nothing more than eye candy, it was nice to be treated to an interactive experience, where what was being said was as important as what was being done. Any American, with a sense of pride in their Country, will be able to watch this movie and be proud of their heritage.
