to take a comic and put it in onto the big screen a lot of creative licence must be taken otherwise you get a dodgy film. you can't make a believable, serious film with people running around in bright yellow spandex. the costumes were well done, the actors well picked. you've heard all the good stuff already so... 'nuff said.
