Wow, what a surprise. A totally entertaining movie. Not only did it make me wish that I had a large family around me, but made me incredibly hungry for Greek food. What a pleasure to have an enjoyable, loving movie without special effects and lots of sex and four letter words. So delightful that I saw it 3 times and I now own the videotape.
