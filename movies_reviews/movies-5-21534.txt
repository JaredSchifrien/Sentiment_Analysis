George Lucas sent the series out in style.All the pieces of the puzzle come together.No stones left unturned.While the first two were a little lackluster,Lucas hit one out of the park with Episode 3.Lots of action,a little romance,a touch of horror and some shocking moments as well.5 huge stars and two big thumbs way up!
