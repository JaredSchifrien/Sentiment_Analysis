A very funny movie. It is one of those movies that sounds so weird and bad when you try and describe it. but give it a try and it is a lot of entertainment. A down on his luck producer and his accountant figure they could make more money off a flop than a success so they set out to produce the worst play ever. they find it in a play called Springtime for Hitlerthey have to meet with the playwright, and a director and cast the play. it has a lot of oddball characters. and then just when they think they succeed in making the worst play ever they get a huge surprise.It won't give the spoiler. this is one of those movies when I heard about it I thought it would be bad but ended up finding it to be very funny. Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are both good on their roles.
