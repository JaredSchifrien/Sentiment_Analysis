This film was better than I ever expected. I like Kaufmann's eccentric, creative and somewhat quirky style that he uses to tell stories like he did in Being John Malkovich. He doesn't go down the road of writing conventional, formulaic movie scripts and like some movie makers nowadays he breaks the rules of the routine consisting of a beginning, middle and end. His characters always have soul and you as the audience care about them. In Eternal Sunshine... the story was to do with love, but he didn't go down the route of making it too sickly, but more entertaining and very interesting. Kaufmann is one of those rare film writers where you can watch his movies over and over again and capture something new that may previously have been overlooked. Jim Carrey is so much better in serious roles than comedy and this is the third film I've seen that he was involed in that I liked. Kate Winslet continues to progress in a profession that shes almost mastered and the supporting cast (Jim Broadbent, Kirstin Dunst and Elijah Wood) were just as good.
