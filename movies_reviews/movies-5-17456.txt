 Clue but in a French musical sort of way. Some of French cinema's best known names are in this movies and it is about 8 women who are connected to each other and a murder. Not only do each women have something to hide about their motivations and opportunity for murdering the victim, but each is hiding a secret of their own as well. Will the timeless Catherine Denueve, French film icons Danielle Darrieux, Fanny Ardant, Emmanuelle Beart and more, this movie packs talent. It is a dark comedy, liberally laced with songs appropriate to the character and the plot of the film. You will identify with atleast ONE of the characters and the surprise ending is unexpected.
