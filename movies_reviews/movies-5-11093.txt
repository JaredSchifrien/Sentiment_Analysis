this is one of the most funniest movies i have ever seen!!!!! I dont think that it would be as funny if someone else other than Jim Carey was playing the part of Charlie/Hank. He adds the Vibe to the movie. This is a great hilarious movie that i would recomend anyone who wants a good laugh or has a sense of humor
