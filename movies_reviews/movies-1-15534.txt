this movie was horrible. it set a new low in filmic history for academy award winners, and possibly marked the point at which film reached maximum sentimental hogwash. right down there with dancing with wolves (fools). cameron has developed into a total fool, having created the rather remarkable terminator and then divorced his talented wife.
