This film is truly practically perfect in every way, and it's one of my all time favourites. Julie Andrews plays the part of the irrepressible nanny, Mary Poppins, extremely well. Her voice is so soothing that I have fallen asleep during he song Stay Awake on numerous occassions! Dick Van Dyke is an excellent Bert, despite his absolutely AWFUL attempt at a cockney accent. David Tomlinson is also on top form as the uptight father, George Banks. All in all, a superb film, which will make you cry and laugh at the same time. I LOVE YOU MARY!
