This is a truly creative film. It doesn't just draw you to the main character, but opens doors in your psyche you didn't know existed. It didn't bring out joy, sadness, nor thrill in me like typical films. I accessed a void, now longing to fill. It's hard to explain. I didn't know if I should cry, stop watching, kill myself. It was a trip.
