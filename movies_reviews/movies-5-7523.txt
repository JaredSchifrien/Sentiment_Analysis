John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd star as ex-felons on a mission from God to raise money to save an orphanage. They set out to gather the members of their (musical) band and throw a concert to raise the money. With musical cameos by Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder and others, a comparable movie would be impossible to make today. Any fan of blues music needs to watch this movie.
