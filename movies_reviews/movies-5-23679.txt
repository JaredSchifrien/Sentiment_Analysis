Another complex Gilliam masterpiece. Most folks want escapism that doesn't bewilder, which is why a lot of his work keeps people at arm's length. 12 MONKEYS is one you have to watch at least three times in order to pick up the detail (most do it once, roll their eyes, and get in line for THE MATRIX). A chain-of-events thriller for the thinking person.
