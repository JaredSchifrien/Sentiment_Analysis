A man is the lone survivor of a plane crash. He is then taken under the wing of a guy who recruits lucky people. His mentor informs him that he has a luck power, and he has the power to steal other people's luck. He takes him to underground gambling places where luck is needed. They take pictures so if someone loses, his luck is surrendered through the picture. They do things like run through a forest blindfolded, play Russian roulette with five bullets, and run through traffic blindfolded. He loses his luck, and his girfriends , and tries to get them back. I am not doing this movie justice. It is a great movie.
