This is a bad movie, no question. In general this movie consists of several men wanting to screw Jane Fonda who is naked on and off throughout the movie. This movie is some sort of musical style science fiction movie if it is possible for such a thing to exist. I have not seen many things worse than this piece of manure, and I find the film to be generally disgusting. I suppose you might want to rent this if you haven't seen Jane Fonda naked, but there are many other women who look better than her naked.
