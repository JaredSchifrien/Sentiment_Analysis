Very well done. I grew up watching and reading X-men. So I was very satisfied with how this was done. The cast was perfect with one or two exceptions. I was pleased that they decided to keep Magneto's origin. Since that is his main reason for despising mankind. But like all comic book movies it wasn't exactly like the comic. But considering that fictional characters have been turned into flesh abd blood actors it is easy to forgive these faults. I expect the same satisfaction from the sequel.
