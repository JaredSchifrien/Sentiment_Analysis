A truly moving film from beginning to end, The Man Without A Face is a tale of a deep bond between a disturbed young boy and a troubled, disfigured recluse who cannot rid himself of his past. Mel Gibson is absolutely fantastic in his role, and it speaks well of him that he was able to act so wonderfully AND direct at the same time. However, the film is stolen by the performance of fourteen year old Nick Stahl, whom Mel Gibson picked personally for the role. In my opinion, he couldn't have picked a better kid for the role. I've written elsewhere on this site just how much potential I think Stahl has, and I truly believe that he will go far in Hollywood. The movie itself had some moving moments, and it was espescially interesting watching both characters evolve and form an unbreakable bond of friendship. Chuck (Nick Stahl) manages to see Gibson's character for who he really is, and towards the end of the movie, he says I can't see your scars anymore. Chuck's quest for knowledge brings to him an unusual friendship with Gibson's character, who we see gradually open up to the little boy. The ending was espescially moving, and provided an excellent conclusion to a wonderful movie. This is highly reccomended- it will remind you of the value and the grace of a true friendship.
