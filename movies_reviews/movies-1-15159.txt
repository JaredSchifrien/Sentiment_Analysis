I just don't understand why this movie got so high ratings and is still talked about today. When I watched it, it just seemed like a plain movie to me. It has such a common, uninteresting plot. Maybe I just didn't get the meaning behind this movie. I'd be more than happy to learn more though, if anyone's willing to discuss it...
