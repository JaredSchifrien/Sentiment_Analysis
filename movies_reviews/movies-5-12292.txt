One of the best Tom Green movies and one of my all time favourites. Its hilarious. Its about a guy who promises his niece that she would pay her tuition to Harvard, but also promises his fiancee to buy a house. He tries to make them both happy by spending his savings on a house and tries to think of a way to get $20000 for his niece with his friend Duff played by Tom Green. Needless to say...hilarity ensues!
