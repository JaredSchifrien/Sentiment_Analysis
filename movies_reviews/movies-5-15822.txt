I must admit, that when I was first told about this movie...I really had no desire to watch it. It had seem'd to me, that it would absolutely bore me. But upon renting, and watching it...I could not tear my eyes away from it within the first 5 minutes. This movie absolutely entranced me. I had never really heard of the Marquis DeSade before this movie...except from what the clerk at the movie store told me. From watching this movie, I have learned where S M came from. Rush gave an absolutely AMAZING performance. Rush has always been one of my favorite actors, and is an extraordinary performance artist. But I do believe that he has absolutely out done himself in Quills . And of course Winslet, is one of those actress' who just claim your attention upon entering any scene. I do believe, she did a wonderful job in this movie. She portrayed her character, in what I believe the best mix, of innocence, lust, and adventurous. She is a lovely actress. And then of course there is Phoenix, who although most of the movie, played a besotted young priest, trying to deny himself...came through whole heartedly towards then end of the movie...while losing himself. This movie is a wonderful portrayal of lust, greed, hate, intense sexuality, and the ultimate price of passion. Whether that passion be writing, sex, love, or hate. This movie moved me as no other has. And I bow down to the wonder and amazement of this enticing story.
