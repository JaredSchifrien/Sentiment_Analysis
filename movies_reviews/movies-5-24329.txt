Ok, it wasn't as good as the comic book it was based on - but it still stood strongly as far as I was concerned. In regards to Dorian not averting his eyes when Mina showed him his picture, I think that is viable considering he hadn't seen the picture for decades and lets face it, its hard to look away when someone is showing you your soul. The effects were fantastic, I think the people who made The Hulk should check out this film and see what he should have looked like....
