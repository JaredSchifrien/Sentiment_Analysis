An awesome movie by the don of avant-garde, Mr Quentin Tarrantino. I do adore spaghetti westerns and martial arts movies (as does Tarrantino) and this film was a little of a tribute to both (Even a few of the songs are by the western composer Ennio Morricone!). David Carradine is of course a star from a multitude of cheesy martial arts movies and yet his performance in this movie is enigmatic, measured, intimidating but with a sentimentality that makes one empathize with him (which adds spice to the Bride's ongoing fued with him, which is far more emotional then physical). Uma Thurman is powerful in this movie, of course she doesn't look glamourous at any time during the film, often she looks dirty, sweaty, frazzled, wounded and storied which is exactly the type of raw uncompromising image her character is meant to convey, so I say Bravo! It requires patience to view and fully appreciate this movie. This is the film's greatest strength and it's greatest weakness. The scenes meant to gradually build up tension and the ones containing oodles of esoteric dialogue will bore some but fascinate fans of Tarrantino's style. A ponderous nature and originality is something lacking in Hollywood these days and this film supplies it in bundles which is what I say makes this and all of QT's films rise above the rest.
