Most Graham Greene materials brought to the screen are good and this is no exception. One caveat is to try to get a British print rather than the American print. The American cuts some scenes that are important. Anton Karas' zither score is unusual but really adds to the film once you get used to it. The scene at the top of the ferris wheel is marvelous. It reminds me of the Devil tempting Christ but that is probably a stretch for most people. Greene wound many religious themes into his novels, however. The interplay of the light and shadows makes it for me. Avoid the colorized version.
