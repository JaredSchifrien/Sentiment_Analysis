If you ever want to watch a movie that isn't good at all, I recommend Lost in Translation. I heard great things about this movie, so I grabbed a six-pack and sit on the couch and watched this. The six-pack was priceless compared to this crappy movie (and it was cheap beer). I have apologized to my DVD player every since for making it play such garbage. p.s.- Sorry DVD player.
