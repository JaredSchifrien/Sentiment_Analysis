A spectacular movie with an outstanding cast. I never get tired of watching The Matrix, as there is always something new, exciting, and intriguing with every viewing. Keanu Reeves succeeded in establishing Neo as a new hero figure. He brought him to life, gave him all of the important qualities necessary to move the movie along and did it in a unique and sophisticated way. This movie will live on through it's groundbreaking special effects, it's alluring storyline, and the visual experience which embodies the essence of that which is the Matrix.
