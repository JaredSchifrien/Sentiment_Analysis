To be honest, I haven't actually seen it. But I have read reviews saying that they modernized it (e. g. Gwendolyn gets a tattoo) and ommited many of the funny parts of the play. I loved the play, thought it was extremely clever, funny and witty, and I consider Oscar Wilde a comic genius for it. But this new movie version apparently is a disgrace to the play and I don't intend to see it! ):0(
