I love this crazy old movie! It seems weird to think it is now over 21 years old! This was the very best of all the SNL inspired movies (if you don t believe me, rent The Coneheads eeek!). Not only that it was probably one of the very best if not the best left to us summing up the talents of John Belushi. He gave a performance here that really encompassed his unique comedic abilities both past and present and with a bittersweet hint of what might have been. I think my favorite part (and there were so many classic bits to choose from) was when the two brothers went back to the orphanage to visit the Penguin . When she finally has enough of them she starts hitting them with a ruler - they try to run but Jake can t squeeze out of the desk he was sitting in and has no choice but to roll down the stairs. Pure silly slapstick, but it still makes me laugh my head off every time!
