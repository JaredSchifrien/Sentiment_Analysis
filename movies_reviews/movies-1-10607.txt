One of the five worst movies ever produced for a large audience. And there is nothing worse than having to watch it with a pack of females who think it is romantic and charming. It isn't. It is contrived to the Nth degree and desperately trying to be quirky and loveable. Good for people trying to diet because this film will make it difficult for the viewer to keep his food down. On a par with Superman III.
