I love the book, I love the story, and finally, I love the movie (TFOTR). My father was an exellent storyteller, and this was the first and only story he told to us (three of us), and it was a christmas gift, and what a gift it was! The movie has now completed my dreams and imaginations of what I would have loved to have share with my visual senses then, as a child, and now. This movie was not ment to replace your own imagination, nor will it, if you're a true fan of the book. But it should fill the gap for most of your senses. I hope everyone learns something from the book, and then go out and enjoy the movie(s) with friends and family...peace out.
