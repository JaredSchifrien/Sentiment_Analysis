The most underrated epic of all time. This movie was the first to have the most realistic battles and to corretly portray the dark times of the middle ages. Combined with an unforgetable story, characters, visuals, soundtrack, and scriptline, this makes it my favorite movie. J.R.R. Tolkien based his character Aragorn after the untold story of William Wallace in real life. Those who say this was a bad film have a narrow and bad taste in films because it meets all the standards of an epic. It was included on the top 100 films of the 20th Century lists and won 5 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director (Mel Gibson). Some may say it was historically inaccurate but like it said in the film...History is written by those who have hanged heroes. Every man dies, not every man really lives.
