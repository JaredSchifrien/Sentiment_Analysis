excellent suspense thriller. very graphic, fine acting by hauer and howell. just when you think it's stopped... who knew hbo was good for anything? he couldn't walk very far. why not? because i cut off his legs. and his arms. and his head. and i'm going to do the same to you. kids, don't pick up hitchhikers, especially if they want to die and take a lot of people with them. that dialogue was spoken in a car with a drop of rain hanging like his sanity off of rutger hauer's nose, in a thunderstorm, in the middle of nowhere. for atmosphere, you just can't beat it.
