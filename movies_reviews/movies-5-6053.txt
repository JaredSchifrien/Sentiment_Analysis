A quintessential western/suspense story. The idea to have the film take place within itself (the length of the film dictates how much time the marshall has until high noon) was absolutely brilliant on the part of the producers. And of course, there is Grace Kelly, in her her lead role, looking and sounding as best as she's ever been. Her performance in High Noon is one of the best in movie history.
