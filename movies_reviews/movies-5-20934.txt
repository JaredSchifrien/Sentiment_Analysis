Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge is perhaps the most wonderfully convoluted film since Magnolia , and it may be better. Rouge is pure, unadulterated cinematic adrenaline, full of the emptiness of glamour, and the power thereof... It manages to pack itself so full of sheer brilliance that it virtually explodes. Far from perfect, this is definitely one of cinema's eclectic masterpieces. It moves with the pace of an electric lightshow through a plot of shoestring breadth with all the power that any movie romance can muster. How does it do it? By being something more than I've ever seen before... It's striking, beautiful... It is doubtlessly going to become the inspiration for a thousand imitations, making it the best and worst mainstream event of 2001's cinema. It's a collage of art. And it is, truly... art!
