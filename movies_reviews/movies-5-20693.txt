One of the best musicals. A wonderful family movie.I love the fact that this movie is based on a real family. Julie Andrews is terrific as Maria ,We love most of the songs.We have the movie and the cd. A movie about a nun who is sent to be a governess to seven children. She teaches them to sing and takes them on outings. Of course the captain and Maria later on fall in love and marry.and the family has to find a way to get out of Austria to get away from the NAzis. Good movie we all enjoy.
