Hey! This isn't at the top of the SW list?! I'll fix that! All the other five-star reviews pretty much sum up what I have to say; definitely still the very best entry in the saga, kicking the drama and action up a big notch or two. Only the yet-to-be-produced Episode 3 has the potential to surpass this one, and a slim chance at that. The 1980 FX still stand up well. One of the greatest scores of all time, along with the other two trilogy entries. Oh, and btw, I still strongly recommend that the best way to see this movie is a widescreen copy of the original version of ESB. The 1997 SpEd rather irritatingly screwed up a few sequences. Whenever Lucas gets around to putting the classic trilogy on DVD, I hope he sticks in an edit-your-own-edition feature...I can dream, can't I? :)
