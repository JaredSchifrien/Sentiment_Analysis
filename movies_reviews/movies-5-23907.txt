Brad Pitt did a good job in this movie. People may think he's all looks, and while he does look good, his acting looked just as splendid in this film. From what I knew about this battle coming into the movie, I thought the directors did a good job. There were a couple of sketchy things, like Orlando Bloom's acting, which made me think about the hot girl in front of me, but otherwise, that girl couldn't have distracted me from this movie at all, because it was very well done.
