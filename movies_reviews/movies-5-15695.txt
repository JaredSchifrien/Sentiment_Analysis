One of the best visual and dramatic films. This movie is rich with philosophy and mythology. It just boggles the mind. This movie was sooooo good. I want to go to the heaven they went to. The symbols they used were so good. This movie did a lot for me. I love the way he sacrificed himself for his wife. He loved her so much that he would rather live with her in hell than live without her in heaven. It reminded me of the legend of Orpheus and Euridicye.
