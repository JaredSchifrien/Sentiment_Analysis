this movie was just filled with talent. julia roberts as shelby was lovable. sally fields as maylynn shelbys mother was a great performance. darryl hannahs character was irritating. shirley maclaine and olympia dukakis were hilarious especially when they did scenes with each other. those 2 were my favorite. its funny its sad its happy all in one
