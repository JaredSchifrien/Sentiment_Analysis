This is by far the Greatest movie of all time and David Leans best film. A biography of the enigmatic T.E. Lawrence the desert loving Englishman who united arab tribes in the battle against the Ottoman turks during WW1. At the center of Leans sun-drenched, 70mm canvas is young Peter O'toole (Lawrence) in his Debut movie. All the actors gave great performances, especially Peter O'toole, Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn gave his best performance in this movie. Freddie Youngs cinematography was spectacular, making it seem as if the desert was alive. The most striking scene in the film is when Sharif Ali (Omar Sharif) is introduced as a tiny dot on the desert horizon that steadily enlarges as he gets closer. This film has to be watched in widescreen. The directors cut version of the film is much much better than the edited version.
