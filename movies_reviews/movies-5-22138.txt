This movie was excellent in all aspects of film making, from the martial arts choreography, to stunning visual effects, to screen play transitions. The Matrix is original, breathtaking and a masterpiece. The meaning behind it all shows us that our world is ruled by the beast, in which humans are enslaved to empower and breathe life into the beast. This movie shows that we all can break free from our oppression and free others at our own will.
