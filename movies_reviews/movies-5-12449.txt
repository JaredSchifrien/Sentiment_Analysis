In gruesome perfection, 'Hostel' gives a taste of hell, an exhibition of depravity so deep that man actually pays to sin in the most desperately wicked ways, and Satan laughs at making man his "b*tch." Three guys go into a hostel...likeable enough, only flirting with sin really, on a trip, just trying to be happy. But one by one they end up victims of a pay-to-torture sadism club, $25,000 for an American. Near flawless story, characters, acting, directing, set, music, production. Even an empathetic protagonist and a denouement, but if your resolution must be happy happy, save your $. 'Hostel' fleshes out and inspires responses to evil--despair, energization, or numbness. This movie is filled with nudity, drugs, and extreme gore, but it's not glorified, and so I recommend 'Hostel' for exposing man's sinsickness and hope that viewers might seek the Cure. (Last week's news here in Florida showed how this sadistic tendency is more and more out now, not restricted to government torture or internet sites: one man was arrested for double murder after spending money for bus, taxi, and hotel to go manhunting in a park just because he said he felt like killing, and another 2 guys were arrested for murder after videotaped beating homeless men smiling through it all.)
