What can I say, this is a classic and the Grandfather of modern zombie films. You know, the living dead aren't for everyone. Personally I like the idea. And this is the first. What a great idea! The dead coming back to eat the living! You know they out number us! Either stop killing or lose the war. Night of the living dead was a well thought out and well written horror movie for its time. George Romero is very smart when it comes to writting movies from the scientific point of view as well as a human point of view. Every character just about has a real feel to them. Like a neighbor or an aquantence at school. Night of the living dead proved to be a very bankable idea as well as a very expandable idea. The Psycho of the Living Dead genre. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. AN ABSOLUTE CLASSIC.
