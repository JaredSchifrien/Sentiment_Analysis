Wow, i cant believe some people didnt think this was scary! i have to say that it is the only movie that has ever scared me, i saw it when i was younger and have refused to see it again. I can honestly say that it let me in comlete hysteria! I still have nightmares about it. I think i am scarred for life. and i am now severly terrified of leaving my computer thinking about this movie. It was a true horror movie though!
