Hey everyone! This is one of those nights where I can't sleep.. so I'm here sharin my opinion ...Well, Monsters Inc was adorable.. ya see, my friends and I went to the movies and well.. the only movie not sold out was this so we went to see it.. and we weren't sure what to expect, but surprisingly Im sitin there.. like Oh my gosh, Im gonna cry thats so cute! It was an adorable movie! The actors who played the voices are a few of my favorites.. Like Billy Chrystal.. he is ablsolutely hilarious and John Goodman... aww this big guy is too cute.. hehe I love them! The movie had a good plot and a cute ending.. And during parts in the movie, some of the background and stuff actually looked somewhat real.. It was pretty cool. Alright people I'm gonna go now.. and recommending all of you who are interested in cute family movies to go see this one :)
