I would normally never have watched this movie, but I was on a bus in Mexico and it happened to be the in-route movie. Long before it was over, I was hoping to be one of those stories you hear about where a bus in Mexico collides with another, or perhaps hurtles off a cliff. I knew how Oedipus felt when he blinded himself--and all he had done is slept with his mother; I had to sit through the length of this absolutely worthless drivel passing itself off as entertainment. I honestly don't understand why this movie was popular with anyone other than the most dedicated masochists.
