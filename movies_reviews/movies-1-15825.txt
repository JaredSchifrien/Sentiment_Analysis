Just read the guidelines for writing comments and you stated you love to laugh. I'm sure you were amused at one of your Rate-Its who believes that sexuality is the only thing that binds us humans together. That statement makes me want to cry for the poor unfortunate soul who lives a life believing that. The same writer also states that the human race is nothing more than cattle. Thank God... said writer can do more than Moo...he did give Quills 5 stars, which is about what a cow WOULD give it. Another comment from another writer states that Quills was about the writter Marque who wrote about his passions and sexual urges that in that time were considered wrong. Have I missed something or is it not still considered wrong to capture under age girls for sexual exploitation. I guess masturbating into a Chalice would not be termed wrong but is there anyone out there in Cyber Space who thinks some things are morally wrong? Another writer thinks the film represents freedom......and I ask freedom to do what??? Does the Rate-It not believe that any freedom carries the profound weight of responsibility? This is a pornographic film and its scary that our society today gives 5 stars to pornography all the while worshiping a Golden Calf they call, FREEDOM
