Truly a classic! Bogart and Bergman are absolutely fantastic as are Heinreid, Rains, Greenstreet and Lorre. Michael Curtiz's direction is great. He sure knew how to make great movies! And of course, there is Max Steiner's score. Well, whenever you hear the song As Time Goes By, don't you have an instant recollection? Excellent movie!
