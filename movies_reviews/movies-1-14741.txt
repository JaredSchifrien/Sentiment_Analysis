When are people going to realize that Julia Roberts is one of the least talented actresses ever to (dis)grace the screen? This movie is an insult to anyone with even a modicum of intelligence. Chauvinism aside, theres not a company in existence that would put up with a bitch like this past her first coffee break. Grotesquely implausible, forced acting performances (especially from Roberts), and vapid dialogue makes rates this movie a must avoid .
