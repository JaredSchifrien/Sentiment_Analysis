Forgive me, but I adore this movie. I rented it really for lack of anything else that I really wanted to see, plus I thought it looked kinda funny. It turned out to be surprisingly adorable. Alright, fine, very unbelievable, but so what? It's a movie, not a documentary. And I thought it did a fantastic job of portraying high school life as it really is, which many movies miss the mark on. I would consider this a chick flick, with porn stars. It really is a teenage love story, and yeah, pretty much a carbon copy of Risky Business, but in a heavy time of remakes, if there is going to be one, it might as well be a good one, and this is.
