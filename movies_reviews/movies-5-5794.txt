Great character study with a superb cast. If you want a movie with action, thrills, suspense, and romance then you won't find it here. But if you want great acting and a storyline that will make you think then this movie is for you. The movie starred Henry Fonda who works hard to convince some jurors that a murder case is not so clear cut. The jurors are a who's who of character actors- Martin Balsam, Lee J Cobb, John Fiedler, Ed Begley, Jack Warden, Jack Klugman and more. A stand-out classic film.
