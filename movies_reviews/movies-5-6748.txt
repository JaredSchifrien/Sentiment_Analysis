I never thought I would like a movie about a boy and a fisherman.I ended up loving this movie. Freddie Bartholomew plays a boy who is rich and spoiled rotten. he is on a ship with his dad. When he falls overboard he is rescued by a fisherman played by Spencer TRacy. This was back in the 1930s and the Fishing boat has no way of contacting People, Harvey ends up on this fishing boat for the next three months. He becomes friends with Manuel the man who rescued him. Harvey has to earn his keep on the boat. It starts out rocky since he is a spoiled brat but eventually he changes into a more responisble well behaved child. What i especially love about this movie is the friendship between Harvey and Manuel. Toward the end there is a tragedy.{a tear jerker} this is a very well done movie. Spencer Tracy is perfect as Manuel the fisherman. and Freddie Bartholomew is good as Harvey. A definite classic of a movie.
