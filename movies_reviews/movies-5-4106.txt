An extremely entertaining little movie with a good moral point. Be good and just and everything will turn out okay. Filled with literally hundreds of subtle jokes, it simply begs to be watched over and over again. I keep hearing this theory that WONKA is evil, and I just can't see it. He is a bit eccentric, but in a cute and funny way. This was the only movie that Peter Ostrum, Charlie, ever made. The DVD version contains the best video commentary I have ever heard, with the first gathering of the child stars of the movie sitting down and watching the movie. Check it out.
