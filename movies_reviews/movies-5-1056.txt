Released in 1996 and directed by Joel Coen, Fargo is an eccentric, black comedy detective film set primarily in Minnesota. For the uninitiated, the plot involves dishonest car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) who must find money quick to bail him out of an insurance scam gone bad. His plan is to hire two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife so he can get the ransom from his rich father-in-law. Of course the plan goes bad resulting in several murders which brings the local (and pregnant) Sheriff Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) on the case. While hacking through the clues and schemes, Gunderson must deal with the weather, the odd local citizens, and food cravings. In many ways, this film is like a full-feature episode of television's Northern Exposure on steroids given the eccentric characters, climate and screenplay; however, what makes the movie is the performances of Macy, McDormand and especially Buscemi. The latter's portrayal of swarthy kidnapper Carl Showalter is in stark contrast to the slower paced Nordic characters and scenery. In many ways, Showalter is the hare to Sheriff Gunderson's turtle which adds a feeling of tension and inevitability to the story while Macy's Lundegaard spins his wheels in proverbial quicksand only to get deeper into the quagmire he created for himself. The bottom line is that Fargo is not for everyone and is not a typical Coen brothers film; however, for those who like cerebral black comedy, this movie is a must see.
