This movie was too long and too predictable. It relied too much upon the star quality of its male lead to sell tickets. It's hard to make a movie about a historical event and make it not predicable, but we all know that in the end the ship sinks. Also, if you watched the previews, you already knew everything that happens. Very disappointing, long and boring movie. I fell asleep during it.
