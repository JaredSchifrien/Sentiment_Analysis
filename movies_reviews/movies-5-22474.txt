This is simply one of the best Star Trek movies ever. Kirk and crew fight an old foe from the past who takes Chekov and his captain hostage and steal a Federation starship on a quest to steal a device that can transform planets, and, of course, revenge against James T. Kirk. The battle sequences are tense and action-packed. The emotional scenes pack a punch and the spacedock scenes are beautiful, as usual. And, the ending is shocking, to say the least. Highly recommended for all!
