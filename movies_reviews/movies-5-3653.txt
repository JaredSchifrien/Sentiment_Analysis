if you want mindless, moronic action, this is the film for you. (girls, don't bother clicking the NO button, i just helped you out.) jet li shows off his considerable fighting skills against the only worthy opponent they could find for him: jet li! thank god this role didn't go to the rock, as it was supposed to. the great one is fine and everything, but i doubt he has the pinache for all of his smacketh laying downeth ability to properly club a guy with a motorcycle. very solid fx, with a sort of 'terminator' feel. the final fight alone is worth buying this flick for, no doubt about it. most people will hate it, but people take movies too seriously these days (thanks, quentin.) don't expect a great plot. it is, however, the best script jet li's gotten, and it shows. with the right lines, there'd be no stopping this guy. i'm nobody's bitch is a good first step, though. nice poetic justice at the end, resolving things into heaven and hell.
