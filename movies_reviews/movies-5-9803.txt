This movie was excellent! The American President had it all- good plot, great acting and great directing by Rob Reiner. I origionally thought that Michael Douglas, given his filmmaking history and playing in movies like Fatal Attraction, would not be a good choice to play the President- but boy was I wrong. He brought a sense of charm to the film. Michael J. Fox was great as the paranoid Louis Rothschild. Martin Sheen was also great as AJ. Annette Benning and Michael Douglas have such chemistry together on screen. A great movie!
