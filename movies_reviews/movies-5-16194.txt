A wonderfully thoughful movie, it takes an unlikely duo in a foreign place and strikes the human chord of the search for meaning and fulfillment. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannson are phenomenal, their mastery of their roles was amazing especially when there wasn't dialogue. An extremely poignant, artful film. Sofia Coppola is such a fantastic talent! She treats films like paintings, delicate and emotional. I can't wait for her next project.
