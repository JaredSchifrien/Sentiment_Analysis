This is just a great movie! I get a little frustrated when people just talk about how sexy it is. It is sexy but that's not the main thing that makes it so good. It is very intense and suspenceful. I admit I rented it because I wanted to see Sharon Stone, but I soon forgot it was her and just got into the story. It is a well made movie.
