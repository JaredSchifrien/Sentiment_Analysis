A must see thriller. Robert Mitchum is at nearly his best in this spooky chill-fest. Shelley Winters also stars in this film. Has some truly fantastic sequences, and makes you totally freak out when you hear Mitchum singing the hymn Leaning on the Everlasting Arms . Definitely see it, and you will not be dissapointed.
