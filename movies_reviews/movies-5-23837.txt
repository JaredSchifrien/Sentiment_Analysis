To me, this is the very best of all the Star Trek films. You have Kirk and Picard fighting side by side via the Nexus, an energy band that can make all your dreams a reality. Unfortunately, the villain, played by Malcolm McDowell, is willing to blow up entire starsystems in order to get back to the Nexus. Another plotline includes Data getting a chip installed that gives him human feelings. He has some very funny moments in the film.
