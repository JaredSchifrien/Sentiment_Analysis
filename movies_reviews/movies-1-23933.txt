One of the worst Hollywood propaganda movies about global warming. You don't like global warming? Fine, make a movie better than this! They run from the cold in this awful excuse of a movie. The cold actually stay out. Randy Quaid actuallly sacrifices a useful man to save a son that may, or may not, be alive. He actually finds him, and when he knocks on the door, they get looks on their faces as if the cold decided to try to get them again. Sela Ward stays with a child when no one in their right mind would. People actually freeze instantly. People try to get to safety after they discover the flood waters have frozen. It's odd that Sela, Jake, and Randy all survive in this awful movie. The main family always survives in a disaster movie of this magnitude. I will say this: The scenes involving the three guys monitoring buoys of the coast were great. I wish they were in this movie more.
