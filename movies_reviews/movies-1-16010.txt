Maybe I was watching a different Garden State from these other posters. Did they make 2 of them? Because the one I saw was a dull stinkorama that put my wife to sleep in 15 minutes and intermittently put me in and out of reposo. All I saw was a menadering mess of GEN-X and GEN-Y slackers, losers, dudes, and dudettes wasting their North Jersey lives doing nothing interspersed with doing drugs. Unlike Seinfeld, their doing nothing was neither funny nor interesting. It had the look and the feel of a Kevin Smith movie without the humor. I just don't have interest or patience in watching a film about dudes going nowhere in their lives. I don't like Zack Braff. I hate him in Scrubs and hate his attempt to be the next David Schwimmer. Even the vaunted soundtrack sucked in my humble opinion.
