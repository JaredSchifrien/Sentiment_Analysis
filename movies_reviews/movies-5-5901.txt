Yes, you guys are on the money! Top 15 of all time! Jimmy Stewart and Hitchy are amazing! And Ruby, is there something wrong with a director being an artist!!! You quote artist like its a bad thing. Do you go out to movies just to get a quick laugh or scare or go to be entertained and think films that try to be art are stupid????? Well they are! J/k, to criticize a film for being artistic is absurd.
