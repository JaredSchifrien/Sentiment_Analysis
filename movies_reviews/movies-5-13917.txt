Why Jack Nicholson did not win an Oscar for his performance is completely beyond me. The whole You can't handle the truth outburst was one of the all-time examples of great acting. Oh, yeah, everybody else (Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, etc.) did a pretty good job. A fast paced thriller that never runs out of steam. Anybody know who played Dawson and Downey? I'd like to know. Well, that's enough of my babbling. Take care, everyone.
