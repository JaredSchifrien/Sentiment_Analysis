Without hesitation, the very worst of all the film Fridays. The acting is particularly horrible, as is the plot. The ending is not surprising at all, and the viewer doesn't care for one second about any of the characters. The only thing it's got going for it is the gratuitous nudity, which is more present in this film than in any other Friday.
