This has to be the worst horror movie I've ever seen! I wasn't scared once, I didn't care about any of the characters and the killer was laughable. I was just sitting there thinking: Is this it? Is this considered to be one of the greatest ever? When nothing NOTHING interesting ever happened. Nope I'd rather watch The Dentist 2 again.
