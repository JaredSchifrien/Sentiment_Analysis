Mel Gibson made a lot of people think in this movie. All the blood was for a reason, it just portrays the tremendous suffering that Jesus went through to save us all from hell. Jim Cavaziel (sp.?) did a tremendous job showing the fatigue and the agony of Jesus. Everyone in the theater who was watching was too stunned to get up until the credits were over. I did find out the name of the chiropracter in the movie because of this.
