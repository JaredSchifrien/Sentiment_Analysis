Hilarious movie. Although a little bit of an older crowd in the theater i was in, everybody was laughing throughout the movie. Hanks was great as usual, Marlon Wayans was extremely funny, and all the other supporting actors were very good. Gets an R rating for frequent use of the F Bomb by Wayans, but otherwise a very good comedy.
