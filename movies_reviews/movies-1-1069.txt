One of the worst flicks ever made!! I suppose on some low, low, low level this might have been amusing to a few, but to me it blew. Hard! Watching a movie where half of the time nothing happens and the other half of the time... nothing happens!! The plot was nowhere to be found, the acting so poor that you could throw up (except for Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) and an unseemingly desire to believe that all Scandinavians start and end their sentences with ja, ja, ja or nej, nej, nej . Let me tell you, I live in Sweden and watching someone mispronounce our language for over an hour is not my idea of a good time.
