I love this movie so much that i got the movie on tape and DVD. I got the soundtrack also. I love basketball alot so this the perfect movie for basketball fans. I like the ending so much. I think Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps did a good job in this movie. When I heard that they were going together, I was so happy but then I heard they broke and I was disappointed and still is. I like the movie alot. They even introduced her as if she was a real basketball player at the end of the movie. I liked the fact that they got together at the end and they even showed the real professional players. I watch this movie over and over. I even sleep with this movie. This movie deserves 5 stars for sure. I even went to the show in 2000 to see this excellent movie.
