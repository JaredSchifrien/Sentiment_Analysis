This was a great story. Not exactly a G movie but it's still a great one for kids and adults. A really nice cast (Sylvester Stalone, Christopher Walken, Danny Glover, and probably others as well that I didn't realize it was their voice) I think they should have done more with Utopia since it was emphasized so much. But other than that it's a great movie, with great animation, and a great story. Nice to see that a childrens movie that isn't from Disney got five stars from me.
