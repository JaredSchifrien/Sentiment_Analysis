This piece of worthless filth is not only a testament to the emptiness of modern American cinema, but also a cultural void, sucking the spirits of a generation of youth. Not only is it unfunny, but also painfully crude, with predictable gags about (snicker) MASTURBATION (snicker) and people that stick flutes up each others' asses... What? It resorts to recirculations of the already wothless gags of the original, and continues in its predecessor's path of the dehumanization of women. The glorifiaction of almost pre-adolescent behavior is extended into a sequence praising, in essence, the male predeliction for pornographic voyuerism of lesbians, and exhibits reluctance among the boys toward homosexuality- but they'll do anything to watch two girls together. There's nothing sexy about anything in the film, but there is offense on layers. The worst insult to women since Road Trip .
