There is so much to enjoy about this movie. First of all, it is very true to the book (except the omitted chocolate incident and the added roles of Fred Savage and Peter Falk). Second, Robin Wright makes a lovely and strong heroine. Third, there are too many brilliant character actors in vibrant supporting roles to mention here. Finally, this movie contains one of THE BEST fencing scenes of all time, creatively choreographed and skillfully executed.
