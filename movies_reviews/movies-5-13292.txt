Saving Private Ryan was the greatest war movie. Steven Spielberg has outdone himself . This is one terrific film. Spielberg makes you feel the chaos of war, and let you know how it was. The filmis unforgettable especially the first 30 minutes, where they renact D-day. That was the most realistic combat scene ever. That scene redefined the phrase WAR IS HELL!!! With the images of soldier lying on the ground with spilled intestines, a soldier losing his arm, and picking it up, another soldier getting his leg blown off. The movie also had a moving story line with Tom Hanks leading his squad of seven soldiers to go behind enemy lines and save James Ryan, the only survivor of 4 brothers who were fighting in the war. If you have not seen this movie yet, you need to. It is a great film, and it is destined to become a classic.
