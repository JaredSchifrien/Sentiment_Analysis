This film really gets to me - its so powerful. The story is quite simple. Tom Hank's character is a lawyer who has AIDS and when his employers didn't know, he was a hotshot who had a bright future within the company, and they made homophobic jokes and 'had a laugh'. When it became obvious that he was ill and that he had AIDS, he got sacked for 'misplacing a very important file'. Tom Hanks decides to fight them and enlists Denzel Washington to help him - he happens to be homophobic - but agrees. Throughout the film you see the friendship between the two develop and Denzel's character reach an understanding about gay people. You see how the trial affects Tom's family and partner and how disgusting his former employers were and how even their lawyer hates doing this case. There are many powerful moments in this film and it will make you cry - you will cry big time - I know i did.
