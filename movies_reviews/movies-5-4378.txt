Who didn't like the Goonies? I have watched this movie at least 100 times and it only gets better. A bunch of unpopular kids follow an old treasure map that belonged to a pirate named One Eyed Willy. This movie came out when I was a kid and all of my friends love it. As the kids follow the map they are being chased by 3 criminals. They encounter many booby traps along the way and in the end discover One Eyed Willy's treasure. They save their town and the criminals are arrested. Any kid will love this movie.
