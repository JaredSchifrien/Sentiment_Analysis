In a massive,futuristic,mechanised city,down-trodden underground workers are led to revolt by a malign female robot.Metropolis happens to have been,reputedly,Hitler's favourite film!Don't be deterred;after he came to power,the director Fritz Lang had the good sense to leave Germany.Of all the great silents, for me,it ranks second only to Murnau's sublime Sunrise .With its quite staggering, monumental set designs,inspired special effects and seemingly ceaseless invention,it still stands not only as a revered (gothic expressionist)sci-fi classic,but a true work of genius.
