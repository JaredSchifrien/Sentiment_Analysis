Rarely have I seen a film that was more boring or held my interest less than this poor excuse for a romantic comedy. It certainly did not even begin to utilize the abilities or approach the usual standards of the cast involved. The most glaringly apparent problem was the misuse of the considerable comedic talents of Billy Crystal. He barely had anything to do or say and what he did say was far below par on the humor/wit/taste scale. In particular, the scene with the dog had the distinction of sinking even below the standards of a junior high school boy s locker room. Julia Roberts, cast as Catherine Zeta-Jone s mistreated sister/personal assistant, did manage not to scream and giggle every ten minutes, had a few good lines but her overall character was poorly written and pretty unbelievable. After seeing even a small bit of the insulting treatment she continuously receives from her completely self-centered movie star sister you can t imagine what would have kept her from smacking her silly long before this point in their lives. So, it made no sense that this woman would suddenly grow teeth and fight back after an apparent lifetime of accepting abuse simply because she was now involved with her sister s ex (John Cusack). Overall, I m not sure what portion of this movie made it not work most poor writing, directing, or just an unfocused murky concept. But one thing I do know, considering the many past successes, efforts, and combined talents of the cast I give them little, if any, of the blame for the failure of this film. They simply had very little with which to work.
