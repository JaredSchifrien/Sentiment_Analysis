 Rear Window is one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest achievements. A tour de force on the asthetics of why we watch, whether it be movies or anything else. He's like an artist, painting a picture that is so realistic, you'd swear it was an actual photograph. That's how good he was, and that's how good Rear Window is. Hitchcock should have received an Oscar for his work on the film, because it, along with Vertigo, is the ultimate artist's masterpiece.
