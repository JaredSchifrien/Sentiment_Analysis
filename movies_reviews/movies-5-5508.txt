A very good movie. Alfred Hitchcock at his best. janet Leigh plays Marion Crane who steals money from her place of work and takes off. She ends up at the Bates motel.BIG MISTAKE! An odd man named Norman runs the motel.along with his mother who lives in a very eerie house on the hill.Halfway through the movie Norman stabs Marion to death in her shower.this is a shock since i did not expect the main character to die halfway through the movie.Relatives worried about Marion's missing come looking for her. end up at the same motel.Anthony Perkins is great as the strange Norman. The very end is terrific about Norman and his Mother.A movie that was not predictable. Just very well done. and without all the goriness that sometimes comes with suspensful movies.A real classic.
