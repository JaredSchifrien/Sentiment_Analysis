Without a doubt, one of the best horror movies of all time, that is, if you want to call it that. The Shining is the only Kubrick movie I've seen and it has enticed me to see many more of his work. The casting could not have been any better for this film. Nicholson shines (no pun intended) as the psychopathic keeper of the Overlook Hotel. Good stuff, indeed!
