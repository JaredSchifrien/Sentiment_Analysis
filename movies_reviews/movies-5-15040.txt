I found this movie phenomenal on all levels. The cast had excellent chemistry and amazing talent. The script was a beautiful mix of poetry, humor, drama and plain insanity. I think many were able to associate with the characters on one level or another, especially reaching out to teens, who can often find commonalities with the main character and perhaps the others as well.
