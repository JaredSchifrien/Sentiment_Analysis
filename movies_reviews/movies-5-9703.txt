Meticulous. Down to the super-mellow balding backup musicians for Mitch Mickey adorned in all black. Down to the Peter Yarrow-esque over-dramatic tenor of Folksman Alan Barrows (Christopher Guest). After enough listening, the music seems genuinely good. I've always been a sucker for bluegrass and good harmony and each actor shows a great deal of musical skill. I will nitpick if I may--if anything there were too many actors. Everyone who has ever been in a Christopher Guest venture had to make an appearance leaving little room for character development. But wow, many memorable moments and the improv is at its best. It might as well come out on video. It's not like anyone is still going to see it in the theatre anymore. Enough out of me--great, great flick. And to C. Guest and Co: I'll follow you to the ends of the Earth.
