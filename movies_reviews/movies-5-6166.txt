What the hell is this movie doing way down here?!!! Gable and Colbert are seemlessly brilliant. Colbert has a great body. And Gable was so revered at the time that when he took off his shirt revealing that he wore no undershirt, sales of undershirts plummetted faster than the stock market crash. Fast-paced, witty dialogue, and grownup, sophisticated acting. A great study in what can be acheived when all of the stars are aligned just right. Won eight Academy awards in 1934 and is still every bit a classic.
