This is another example of how amazing Pixar is. The animation was superb and nearly lifelike. But even better than the effects was the heart in the story. What I also liked about it is that usually these kinds of movies are about the kids. But this one was about his overprotective father. I LOVED DORY AND BRUCE! The idea of a fish with memory loss was strange, but turned out to be hilarious and cute. And the idea of a shark being on a twelve step plan to a fish free diet was a good joke on all the plans there are out there today that don't work. The starfish was cute too. I was also having my doubts about seeing William Defoe doing a kids movie, but he really shone. The tank gang were all so cute. I loved how they each had their own personalities. There was one that was protective of bubbles, one that was a french cleaner crab (or whatever it was) and one that thought that her reflection was her sister. They showed living in a tank was like for the fish, and that it could do things to ya . The demonic eight year old with braces really rapped up the idea. When I asked other adults what there favorite summer movie was, they replied Finding Nemo! , not Seabiscuit or Pirates of the Carribean. And they didn't even go with their kids! They went to see it themselves, because they wanted to see it! Overall, a great story, cast and the numerous jokes makes this by far the best movie of the summmer. Truly lived up to if it did not surpass Toy Story and Monsters Inc. I can't wait for Pixar's next movie.
