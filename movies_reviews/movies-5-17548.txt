my favourite hindi movie by far..easily one of the biggest blockbusters to come out of bollywood..the acting was awesome..the story was simple and good..had a nice touch of humour..this movie had everything..had an amazin starcast..if you havent seen it u have to see it..borrow it..if you dont know hindi read the subtitles..trust me its worth it..amitabh's biggest hit..
