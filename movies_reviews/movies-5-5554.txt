They just don't make them like that any more. Casablanca is great concise story telling, a human drama played against a larger than life back drop. There is great characters with their better nature coming up against their flaws andtheir past. There is incredible witty dialogue delivered by fabulous actors. Even the minor character roles like Karl the waiter and Major Strasser are pitch perfect. If it seems cliche or predictable, it's only because it has become such a film icon.
