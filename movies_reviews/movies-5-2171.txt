One of the Top Five "good bad" movies ever made. Starts mysteriously, and ends the same way. Certainly one of Kurt Russell's better-known roles (which he may only sheepishly acknowledge), playing the fun-loving, hard-charging long-haul trucker Jack Burton better than anyone else could've (although you'd swear he was channeling John Wayne from the first frame). Carpenter was given the chance to do something unique, and he succeeded on all fronts with this picture; lots of action, intrigue, comedy, special effects, and an unknown (in America, anyway) line-up of international martial artists at their best. Mr. David Lo Pan might just be one of the all-time best villains (with Egg Shen playing his "Sherlock"). Sprinkle in Kim Cattrall (at her Kim Cattrall-iest) as Jack's confounding love interest, and this is one that can't miss. Not exactly Tolstoy, but it doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is: a fast-and-furious detour through a maze of mystic mayhem!
