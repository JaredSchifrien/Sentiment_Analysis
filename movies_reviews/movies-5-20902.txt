I loved this movie! The music and colorful sets suck you in. Nicole Kidman looks beautiful and has a sweet voice (not the strongest vocals on her part but quit melodic and pretty sounding) I was suprised how well Ewan Mcgregor can sing. This is such a beautiful film for so many reasons.I think the 2 leads were cast perfectly and became a fan of Mcgregor after this one..
