This is an outstanding movie, with an exceptionally well assembled cast. The talented actors bring depth to the characters (I may never stand at a urinal the same again). The visualization of the shamanic tradition played out in the movie is exceptional; anyone who has studied shamanism in any tradition will immediately recognize the sucking shaman in John. It's a three hour movie that actually keeps you interested and stimulated the whole time; You actually care what happens, and want to see someone kick the crap out of Percy. A definite must see...heck, I'm buying a copy!
