My kids are 4 and 5 and were so excited to see this movie (after seeing countless trailers on Nickelodeon). I wasn't quite sure if it was for them (the PG rating) however, we watched it together and everyone enjoyed it! It is a great family movie that parents and children can both enjoy. There was humor, action, neat gizmos and plenty of kid power to keep everyone entertained. The acting was great, the effects were entertaining and the plot was fun. A movie that you can watch with or without the kids!
