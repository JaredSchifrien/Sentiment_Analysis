A jacked up version of the Good Son. Think about the similarities. Both movies have the biggest name child actor of the day, who usually plays nice sweet roles, playing a twisted kid. They turn against the other child and fight for the mother's love. This movie was overwhelmingly boring, the last 20 minutes were probably the most meaningless moments of my life. I think that is what hell is like, you are forced to watch clips of movies that are long and boring and have no purpose. The only reason I went to see this movie is because my girlfriend's cousin, Jake Thomas, plays the human son. Even her family thought the movie was slow and stupid. I think it was well marketed, because if you remember the trailers basically left everything up to the imagination. Everybody assumed that Spielberg and Osmet would team up for a masterpiece, but it turned out to be a disaster.
