It's muckraking...but it's first-class funny as hell muckraking. I love watching my pansy-president sit in front of children for several minutes (after he was told we were under attack) doing nothing. Talk about deer in the headlights. Did he care that he might be a target thus the children just might be in danger? Did he think to ask about his own family? It's just too easy taking shots at this guy. The movie was funny- and certainly far-reaching at times.
