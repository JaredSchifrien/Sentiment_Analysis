Without a doubt, the best Lana Turner movie. I loved Madame X, but this one to me is her best performance. It has some of the saddest scenes and no matter how many times I have watched it, I still cry during those scenes. It is the story of the rise of a struggling actress and her housekeeper who is the most faithful person in her life. It tells the story of each of them and heartaches they each have endured. This is a wonderful old classic movie.
