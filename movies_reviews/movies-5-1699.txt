It all depends on your style of movies on wether you like this movie or not. But what can not be argued is that this movie is flawless in every aspect. The acting was great and the directing couldn't be better. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has many scenes in which you would only see in comic books such as fighting on tree limbs, flying off rooftops and running up walls. This wasn,t done with phony graphics or real cheesy attacks it was done with style and grace. Very well done movie and despite what others say about this movie this should be nominated for the best movie of the year.
