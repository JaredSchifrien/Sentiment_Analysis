I can t tell you what most women want because to be frank I don t give a flying fig. But speaking as a woman, I could have done without this farce. Considering his past success in the Lethal Weapon films, I will say that I feel Mel Gibson has more than proven he can be halfway decent at madcap, insane comedy. However, he needs to realize that his ability to act nuts-o extremely well does not a leading man in light romantic comedy make. This movie made it glaringly apparent that he was never meant to follow in the footsteps of Fred Astaire, Cary Grant, or Gene Kelly. He is, for the most part, an action figure with acting ability who has managed to make some admirable hits within a sea of okay films. If what he has done best so far in his career can be compared to bygone film styles I would say that his forte has been the sweeping epic (Braveheart, the Patriot). What Women Want was almost painful to watch as he clumped his way through this silly, clumsily written game of gender self awareness. Helen Hunt on the other hand after years in fluffy TV sitcom and an acting range that apparently exceeds Gibson s by about 50% seemed more up to the job. But even she couldn t save this pathetic ship full of holes (a few of her lines were actually embarrassingly stupid). Not even semi-funny cameos by the likes of Bette Midler were of much help to this albatross. After forcing myself to stay awake I flipped off the recorder once again thankful I had rented the DVD rather than having paid theater admission and even more glad that I d gotten a special discount rate for signing up with a new video store. Don t waste your time unless you re a major Gibson fan it may be the only way you won t notice the smell.
