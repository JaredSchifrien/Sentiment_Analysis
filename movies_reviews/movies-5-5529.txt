The American Film Institute has chosen PSYCHO as the scariest (er...most heart-pounding) movie of all-time. I would certainly agree. Although I am not too fond of the sub-genre that this film spawned (the slasher flick), I am a fan of Alfred Hitchcock, and what he has done is created one of the most famous and influential motion pictures EVER! PSYCHO's technical brilliance is rarely matched and it's entertainment value is undeniably great. Although conceived as somewhat of a black comedy, PSYCHO is without question the most sophisticated horror movie ever made.
