This may have been the best movie that I have seen in the last three years. Superb acting, a gripping storyline, outstanding cinematography - and the uncomfortable knowledge that yes, this IS a true story, and yes, big tobacco IS that powerful. This movie made me think about so many things - how critical it is to have freedom of the press, how corrupting profits can be, and how hard it is to be a hero. Russell Crowe and Al Pacino were excellent, and Christopher Plummer did a great job as Mike Wallace. Great flick.
