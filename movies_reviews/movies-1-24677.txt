This movie is awful from the start. It opens with a couple of scientists chasing down a 500 pound, invisible gorilla without acting the least bit concerned. The villian of this story is a crazed, invisble and completely naked Kevin Bacon. I mean what the HELL! After sitting through the whole thing I can't figure out why this was allowed to be made or why it is called a thriller.
