This is one of Speilburg's best films and it has a great cast. The editing for this film is amazing. Especially when you have Brodie sitting on teh beach looking out to sea to make sure that its safe and you have people walking past in their different coloured bathing suits and that determines how close the shot is on Brodie. Richard Drefuss is amazing as usual, especially when him and Brodie are trying to convince the Mayor that the beach should be closed as there was definately a Great White in the Waters and the mayor makes a comment about him and he starts laughing. This film has the suspense element done to perfection, especially with that famous music signature. Its a shame that they ruined it by doing all the other Jaws movies.
