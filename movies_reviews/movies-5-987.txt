A movie so real it can almost be catagorized as a horror film. The brutality, lose of innocence and the lack of compassion for ones fellow man and how being put in the center of hell can tear your soul and mind completley apart. This is one of the most heartwrenching and interesting films ever made. A true classic that will hold true forever with it's incredible depiction of the Vietnam war. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
