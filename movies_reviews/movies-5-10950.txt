A terrifically cute throwback to the 60's sex comedies. Ewan McGregor and Renee Zellweger are utterly charming, both pulling in their usual great performances. This film recreates the era with such fun and such joy. Also worth noting is David Hyde Pierce's wildly funny supporting performance. Great sets and costumes, hilarious jokes , and terrific actors make this a genuinely lighthearted flick worth watching.
