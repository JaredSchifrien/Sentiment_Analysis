i would like to share my opinion....i bought the first BW video before renting an saw it because my brother age 19 at the time said it was good it scared him to death well to be honest i hated it, i was so furious about how bad it sucked, in all my life ive never seen a movie more worse then that.....so im extremely reluctant to even seeing the second one yet just earlier last year i did a little research an im not sure yet til i have proof to back this up but it could very well be that the first BW wasnt a movie, it was a real film documentary, suppose to be realistic, real life not fake.....once i have actual proof of this ill share it with you all.....after seeing the first one i did get online an write to anyone i could regarding this movie an expressed my complete regretfulness for even buying the movie, expressed how horrible i felt it was....
