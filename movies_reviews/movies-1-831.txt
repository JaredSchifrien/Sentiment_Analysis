Well I guess I'm in the minority here but I thought the movie was terrible and boring to boot!! Sure the premise of being able to see dead people is spooky and all but somewhere in there people seem to have gotten so swept up by the whole idea of it that they forgot how corny so much of it was with Bruce Willis walking around the city trying to sort out this little kids (and his own) problems. C'mon people work with me here. It was more of a drama than a horror movie. Oh no there's a pastey faced girl under my bed and she wants me to go deliver a box to Mommy and Daddy!!!! Oooohhhh. Now don't get me wrong if I found a pastey faced girl in a nightie hiding out under my bed you can bet I'd freak to the extreme but one things for sure you wouldn't catch me running errands for her. oh and while your out if you would be so kind as to stop off at mummy and daddys to drop of a little something for me I'd be ever so indebted to you
