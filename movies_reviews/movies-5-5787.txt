Aside from paying the all-star cast this has to be one of the cheapest 5 star films ever made. Almost no props and certainly no special effects. Oh wait, they did simulate a rain storm towards the end. That might count as an effect but it was probably a stage hand with a garden hose. As great as the acting in this movie was the movie did not garner a single nomination for best actor. During a year in which Bridge on the River Kwai and Witness for the Prosecution also appeared it is still surprising. It was nominated for Best Picture but lost to Bridge on the River Kwai. The tension and toil among the cast was readily apparent. The sweat dripping from their foreheads and the glistening skin due to the temperature in an uncooled room in summertime New York made the film as uncomfortable to watch as the decision each man faced. A very engaging film whose basic premise is nothing more than one man against the odds. Extermely well done and a true classic. A powerful expose on what good movie making can be. More modern movie makers should go back and review this film.
