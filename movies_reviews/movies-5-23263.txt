Finally snagged the DVD in order to get a copy that wasn't so severely truncated. This is the flick that started it all for me; hokey and sexist in places, but the effects! The Krell interior shots carry me away each and every time. Breathtaking for youngsters, but a fantastic blast-from-the-past for those who remember it.
