This is one of the all time greats John Ford need I say more? Not only are the actors in this movie intence, but you can actually feel there pain. To say this movie is a masterpeice would be an understatement. Depression era Oklohoma, the Joads' in the middle of the Dust Bowl, little food even less money get evicted from there land and move west to California in search of a better life.they have nothing exept willpower to keep them going.And they prove that willpower is enough.The Joads' are fighters, survivers and dreamers. Sort of the way we Americians think of ourselves today, all the bad that happens we manage to find the good.Times change, for bad or good. We must seek the good in the bad. And this is what this movie is about..
