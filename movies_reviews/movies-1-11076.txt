Quite possibly the most embarrassingly bad movie I ve ever seen. I didn t think Jim Carey could fall any farther down on my list of actors I least like to watch but darned if he didn t manage to do just that the other night when I tried to make it through this film. Not since Ishtar have I seen such a criminal waste of celluloid. I don t mind a little mindless bathroom humor once in awhile but not when it s this blatantly mindless and appears to be the sole purpose of the movie. Renee Zellwegger must cringe when she looks back on her decision to become involved in this abortion. I would even think Carey must flinch a little and with his record that s saying a lot.
