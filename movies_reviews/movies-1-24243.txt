I hated the fantastic four movie it had mostly lame characters. For example the Invisible Woman was such and bitch I mean she dumped a awesome guy just because she couldn't get her way. The Thing was so lame I mean you look like a rock get over it! And Oh pleez the Human Torch was an @$$hole with No personality , he was a total bastard. And on the comercials they made him out to be the coolest character ever but he SUCKED!!! The only character that I liked honestly was Mr. Fantastic he was the only likeable character and they didn't even want to put as much focus on him as the Thing or the Torch.
