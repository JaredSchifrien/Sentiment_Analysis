Yet again - another one that made me cry. Billy Crystal is absolutely hilarious in this and the character who looks like the librarian reminds me of the grandmother in 'Dinosaurs' (don't know if anyone remembers that show) its very sweet and the little girl is absolutely adorable. I want a monster in my closet!
