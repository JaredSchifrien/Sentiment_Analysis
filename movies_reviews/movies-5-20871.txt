It has been said that there has never been a better marraige of music with a movie than in Saturday Night Fever. Little do most people know, The Bee Gees were recording their next album when their manager/SNF producer took 5 songs from them long before the movie was completed. You Should Be Dancing was #1 two years before SNF and Jive Talkin was #1 three years earlier. Definetly, a great music movie, which became a way of life for a long time.
