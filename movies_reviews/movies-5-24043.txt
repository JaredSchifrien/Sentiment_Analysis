crazy, crazy movie. i still hate cgi. the story is very quiet, and beautiful, despite the hellraising action scenes. i think i'm in love with the main character. i was afraid to see it, because i don't want to get sucked back into the world of video games (this movie is based on one) but i'm glad i rented it. donald sutherland's gentleness, power, and intelligence were perfectly cast in his role. alec baldwin brings his usual smarmy blend of machismo and whining. the tone is relentlessly dark, but the movie's filled with hope, and nobility. if this had been live action, it would be considered one of the best sci fi films of all time, but it's a landmark for the medium. strongly recommended.
