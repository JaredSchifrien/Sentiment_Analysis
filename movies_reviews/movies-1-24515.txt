Basically we have "The Exorcist" meets "Rosemary's Baby". If you enjoy special effects at the expense of character development and plot, by all means - indulge yourself. Personally, I found this about as interesting as a trip through a meat packing plant on a golf cart going 120 miles per as I'm paging through a comic book of the Gospels according to the mentally deranged. But, I won't go there since there isn't enough space on this page to cover the pathetic use and abuse of theology. I'll just sum up by saying; not funny, not frightening - just near sited, ill informed and very, very dumb. I'll hand it to Reeves though; he apparently stays on top of the acting game just enough to get first choice at the high budget glitz - wherein his only requirement is to storm around like a male model with an inflamed hemorrhoid spouting what might pass as witty one liners - provided you are still in high school. It would appear that the formula is; throw in enough special effects as camouflage and anyone can look like an actor. Sadly, and for reasons I can no longer remember, I gave him a bit more credit than that. Up until now.
