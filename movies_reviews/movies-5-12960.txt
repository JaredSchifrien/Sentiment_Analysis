One of the top five movies of the 90's. Superb acting with a compelling script. Gives an indepth look into the prisons of post World War II America. Displays the power of Hope, it is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and like all good things it can never die. And, oh yeah, get busy livin' or get busy dyin'.?
