One of the best movies of all time. The cast: Great. The actress playing Dr.Jean Grey is very convincing. She's a very pretty woman, one like a lot of women would like to be. The girl playing Rogue was impressive. Haven't seen her in many films, but in this one, she was particularly good. Cyclops (played by James Marsden) is also VERY impressive. Haven't seen him act so well in all the other movies he's been in. Last I will be mentioning (but certaintly not least), is Hugh Jackman. Wow. I was stunned when I saw him act. I was in heaven watching him. Can life get any better than this? I don't think so. He's so amazingly talented and handsome, that I can't put it into words. I seriously love everything about him. I love his smile, his eyes, his hair, his body, even his nose! The man is highly underrated and should receive lots more attention. I am looking forward to seeing ANY other movies he ever decides to do. Heck, I saw Someone Like You the other day. He's wonderful. Everything he's built for is wonderful. This man is so close to being perfect, it scares me. I think I've said enough about him. :o) To sum up, the movie was great. Excelent special effects.
