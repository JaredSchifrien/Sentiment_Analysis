I love this movie to death! I know all the lines and I guess it's because I love Jim Carrey. He's brilliant in this movie, as well as, Jeff Daniels. The story is unique and original and thge classic humour is fantastic, e.g. Pedi he's dead! Oh man i'm sorry Harry what happened? His head fell off! Yeah he was pretty old! It's a crazy, insane movie that will leave you in stitches. If you're not a great fan of Jim carrey I would say avoid this! If you're nutty and looking for a bit of fun, definately worth a watch!!
