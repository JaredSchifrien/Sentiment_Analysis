Quite a waste of my time, the people's time, and the Academy Award voter's judgement. Granted, an epic film is a very tough task to undertake, but Mel Gibson falters on every level here, plummeting a beautiful story into little more than something to throw popcorn at. His acting was ridiculous and overdone, and while the scenery (but not atmosphere) was visually pleasing, he give the viewer no chance to bask in it the way he should. The drama here is all false.
