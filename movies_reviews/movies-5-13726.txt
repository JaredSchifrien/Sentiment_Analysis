This has got to be one of the best war movies of all time. It beats out The Patriot by a long shot. This film had all the goods nad presented a realistic re-enactment of the rise and fall of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment led by Col. Robert Gould Shaw. As a lover of history, I knew that I had to see this movie when I first heard about it, and I was not disappointed. The characters were all perfectly developed, and the buildup to the climax was phenominal. Not to mention the wonderful acting by the all-star cast which included Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, Cary Elwes, Jay O'Sanders and others. I enjoyed seeing each of the characters evlve in their own way: espescially that of Denzel Washington, whose character was so cynical, hateful and spiteful at the beginning but in the end we learned his true feelings of respect for the brave men fighting beside him. Glory is a moving, inspirational film which shows that a true patriot is one who defends his country even when it had wronged him. A true patriot is one who tries to fix the wrong. And that is exactly what the men of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment helped do. A great movie!
