I really didn't have high expectations for this movie, considering my tastes don't normally run towards films about drug dealers, but it really surprised me. Now I'm not going to compare it to other drug movies so maybe that's why I appreciate it so much. George Jung, no matter how you disagree with his lifestyle, was a fairly keen guy. He knew what he was doing-no doubt it. i don't feel sorry for his character or hate him or anything drastic. I was just interested in his story. Johnny Depp was talented as always and really carried the film-the supporting cast really floundered. All in all, without too much scrutiny, I enjoyed this very much.
