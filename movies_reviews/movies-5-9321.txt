This movie is a riot. I laugh my bootata off to this day when I see this flick. A great blend of humor and drama. Not to mention very impressive visual effects. Have you ever seen a movie before or sense that blended both live action and animation and come out with a better film? If you say the adventures of rocky and bullwinkle I will drop kick you I swear to God! Anyway, the live actors hold their own with their toon comrades in this unforgetable crime capper farce. The Weasles are hilariouse as well as beny the cab and baby Herman. Jessica Rabbit has some definate sex appeal. I'd still go out with her over Julia Roberts.Highly Recommended.
