A wonderful, dream like film. For an older woman it is such a pleasure to find a film with all the greatness I remember from the films from the studios. Beauty, fun, and such a touching love story. The subtitles did not bother me at all. I loved it all and had to see it again before it went away and have now purchased to sound track and the book.
