This movie is another example of a classic comic book excellently transformed into a motion picture blockbuster. Featuring classic characters from the comic, it is another good example of a comic cleanly and solidly transformed into a great motion picture. Though there are some clear disimilarities(Wolverine is much taller than his comic book character, and Rogue is clearly younger than she is as portrayed in the comic) and many changes have been clearly seen in the movie, it is still consistently a great movie, showing smooth transition from comic book to movie sequence.
