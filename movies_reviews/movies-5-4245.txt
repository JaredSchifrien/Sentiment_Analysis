This is the cutest movie I ever did see. It was also the first animated movie that I watched that tried to make all the characters more realistic by applying bloopers at the end. It worked wonderfully. Considering I don't even like bugs, this is one of my favorite family movies. Kevin Spacey does a great job, too, in supplying the voice for Hopper.
