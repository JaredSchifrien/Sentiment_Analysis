A superb movie. Chow Yun Fat really shows the world what a great actor he is. Jodie Foster is at her usual best. Love every minute of it. Be careful if you're planning to catch this at AMC Century City. I watched it there around Dec 99, and the sound system suck big time. I hope they already fix it. It makes it hard to listen to the words.
