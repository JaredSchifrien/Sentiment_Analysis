I love this film! And any female over 25 can relate to some of Bridget's happenings if not all. Haven't we all sat there on a sofa singing into a hairbrush? Been overally obsessed with our weight? Made blue soup? This film is quite simply hilarious and when she tells her boss/ex lover (Hugh Grant) I'd rather wipe Sadam Hussains a**e, I laughed out loud. YOU GO GIRL! To fully appreciate this film you would have to be female. But there are some guys that like it too. Colin Firth is lovely in it. Renee acts the part naturally and her English accent is excellent too.
