This movie is horrible. I am not sure what the other people on this page were smoking when they saw it, but they must have been out of their mind. The writing was horrible, the plot was predictable and uninteresting. For most of the movie I was hoping that the machines would win and kill all of these whining pathetic characters. This movie was a greater dissapointment than Star Wars Episode I. Everything that was good about the first two movies was absent from this one.
