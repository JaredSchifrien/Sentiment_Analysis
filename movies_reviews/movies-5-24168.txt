I am not really a fan of science fiction,m but I trully believe this deserves a higher rating. It lasted about 2 1/2 hours, but it didn't seem thatr long when I saw it. The plot came together perfectly, the acting was intense, and the special effects were some of the best I have ever seen. A bit unrealistic, but they don't call it fiction for nothing. 'Rockhound' was my personal favorite, provided some nice comic relief from the drama.
