Probably my all-time favorite movie (and I've seen a few). I named my Scotty Nigel. Christopher Guest is a genius who does not work often enough. Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show just make me want more more more from the guy. This Blueblood and his equally talented Tapsters Michael McKean and particularly Harry Shearer created a tour de force, er, rock de force, whatever. The quintessential mockumentary rockumentary. Now where's my miniature bread! I've been working with it for half an hour and I cawn't figure out...look, there's a little guy.And look who's in here.No one. And in here...it's just a complete catastrophe.
