What a powerful movie. Believe me, this is not a feel good movie. But it is a remarkably well-done film that makes you think. With his variety of camera angles and use of light, director Steven Soderbergh did a tremendous job putting this film together. And the ensemble cast was great, as well. Particularly impressive to me were the performances by Benicio del Toro as the Mexican cop and the girl who played Michael Douglass' daughter. All in all, I highly recommend this film to get an inside look at how drugs impact lives in the ways that you may not immediately realize. Though not for everyone, Traffic will at worst give you something to think about.
