This not only was one of the most boring military-type movies of all time, it was also the most inaccurate. After watching the movie, I am still not sure what type of unit they were supposedly playing. Anyone that could stay awake for this movie could see the shocking ending from a mile away. The entire set of the movie takes place in Panama with some elite quasi-Ranger type unit doing training. Samuel L. Jackson is the senior non-commissioned officer, though he was wearing specialist rank for a few scenes. The plot was extremely corny and sloppy, with pretty weak character development. One thing I look for in these types of movies is at least some accuracy...but I know there are no women in units like this (score: political correctness 1 - accuracy - 0) and usually units that train together dress in the same uniform. I would compare the type of unit to the one in Predator, only this one had no Schwartzaneggar or any other good actors, much less any action. I think the biggest let-down to the movie had to be the ending, where the shock and awe really wants to make you say to yourself, So what? In any case, please save yourself the $10 and don't watch this movie.
