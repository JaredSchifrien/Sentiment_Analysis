WOW, this was one incredible IMAX experience. It had been awhile since I had seen a 3D movie, and I hadn't realized how far it had come. I felt like I was in the movie. Plus, I love computer animation, and Cyberworld gave me plenty of that! The movie is basically a bunch of short 3D animation sequences linked together by a small plot. There were some cheesy points in the plot since the plot was aimed toward kids, but it was cute. The whole movie was complete EYE CANDY. Plus it had the Simpsons in 3D! (Homer^3 from the Halloween special). My only complaint is that it wasn't longer, because I could have watched that stuff for hours.
