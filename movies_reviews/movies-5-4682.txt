'Lilo and Stitch' was the first animated Disney feature I've been to see at the cinema in quite a few years now, and it really hit the spot! It wasn't brought to life in anything close to the acclaimed 3D eyecandy that seems to be in vogue, but instead opted just for simple but beautiful and highly vivid animation that I liked it all the better for. The story too is simple but powerful, dealing with some very complex issues as well as managing to keep you entertained for every moment that passes - an ammoral and destructive little creature on the run from the intergalatic police takes refudge with a lonely little orphaned girl, and the two each make their own individual discoveries, which carry the poignent messages of the importance and love and family, even 'broken' ones. The soundtrack is almost exclusively Elvis Presley, which sounds pleasant enough, a welcome variation on original songs sung directly by the characters. The best Disney film in a decade (that's right - it's even hotter than 'The Lion King'), and a wonderful experience to sit through.
