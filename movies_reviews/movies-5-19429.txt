wow!! when I started watching this I could tell that it was going to be a wonderful movie you know how I could tell?? by the awesome music I like the sound of the music. it's a great movie it's great to have a horror movie that has dead people and slashing in it!! I love it!! it has great imaginitive scenes and The Tall man rocks!! I love movies about sinister-cemetaries this flim is one I truely love and the tall man uses flying spheres to kill people which has a very imaginative way of killing and I love the whole thing about how it seems like a fantasy but, it's real. the ending is great! it scared me tremendously!! but, that's what I loved about it!! this flim is one of my favorite horror movies of all time and I love how it's got to do with the supernatural world! so next time your walking through the video store grab PHANTASM and rent it!! cause it's a awesome movie!! rent it! remember to rent it!! it's great!!!!!!
