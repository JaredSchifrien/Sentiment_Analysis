Anyone that says this movie is pornographic, had no business seeing it in the first place. Most people know that the Marquis put the SADE in SADISM. If you did not know who De Sade was before you saw the film, you certainly do now! It may not have been historically correct, but it was a fantastic film! For those who don't like it due to it's lack of historical accuracy, maybe you would have liked it better if they changed Marquis' name. This movie had me hooked from the opening scene. This is a good representation of what is evil, can sometimes be disguised as good. The other members of the institution are the unsung hero's of the movie. I havn't seen a movie this good, down to the most minute details in a long time. If you liked Dangerous Liasons, you should like this as well.
