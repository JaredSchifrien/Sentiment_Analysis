This romantic comedy is famous for one scene, which is unfortunate, because it is a genuinly funny film. Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal have a certain chemistry that you very rarely find in motion pictures these days. It was a pleasure to watch when it first came out, and it has not lost its appeal now.
