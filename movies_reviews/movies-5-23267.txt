One of the finest sci-fi films of the 1950s. It is an adaptation of Shakespeare's Tempest--look for Ariel in the Robot, and if you can't find Caliban, you aren't watching very carefully (I'll give you a hint from Shakespeare--Prospero's comment on Caliban this thing of darkness I acknowledge MINE ) It's a brilliant movie and I wouldn't mind seeing it again right now... oh, and don't forget to notice one of the first all-electronic film scores, eerie and marvelously effective.
