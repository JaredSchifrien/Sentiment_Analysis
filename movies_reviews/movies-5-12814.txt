One of the best documentaries I've ever seen.. and one of the most touching and disturbing. It basically follows the arrest (on questionable evidence) and trial of three teenagers in West Memphis, Arkansas for the horrific mutilation murder of three young boys. If you're from the deep south you might be offended by all the obvious stereotypes.. although none of them in this film are created for effect. This is life as it really is for the people in question. Rusting trailer parks peopled by folks on welfare wearing trucker hats. The ubiquitous cigarette butt hanging from their lips. Their sad smiles revealing missing teeth. You feel for these people embroiled in something beyond their limited ability to comprehend. A moving and powerful movie.
