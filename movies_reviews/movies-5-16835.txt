I hate and I mean hate golf but this movie was so not about golf. I was so shocked that I loved this movie as much as I did. I watched this one afternoon when I had nothing better to do and nothing was on. After 10 minutes into the movie I was so happy I stuck with it. Robert Redford once again made another great film, with a great cast!!!
