That is one of the bests if not the best movie I have ever seen. The actors are very talented!!! I believe that Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas make a perfect couple. So if you haven't seen it and if you are not afraid to cry a bit (I cried three times during this movie) I really suggest you go see this movie you won't regret it!!!
