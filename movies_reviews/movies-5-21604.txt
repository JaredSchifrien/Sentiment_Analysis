This movie was marvelous. I have always been a fan of Tolkien and fantasy as a genre. When they announced that someone was making The Fellowship of the Ring into a movie I was half over-joyed and half wary of what they may do to the story. But after seeing the movie I'm extremely impressed and cannot wait until the next installment comes out this December. The acting was wonderful, the characters were exactly as they should be and the sets and special effects...they were just amazing. This movie is a beautiful movie in so many ways. Go see it, that's all I can say...just go see it.
