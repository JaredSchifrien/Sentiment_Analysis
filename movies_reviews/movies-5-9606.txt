why the heck is this movie so low on the list? i've never seen someone match jim carrey as well as jeff daniels to utimately make one of the funniest movies ever. i'll admit there are better movies... but c'mon. my big fat greek wedding? while you were sleeping? no way, dumb and dumber is so much funnier! you never get too old to laugh at this kind of movie. if in order to be grown up, you can't enjoy a movie like this, well heck i'm not gonna!
