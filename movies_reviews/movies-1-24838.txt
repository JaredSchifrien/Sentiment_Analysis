If I could rate this movie with negative stars, I would. When I heard about this project, I was excited for months. My favorite book, to be made into a 2 part miniseries! I had such high hopes for it. Great cast, with incredible potential, the screencaps looked amazing (I will give it that, the sets and costumes were bang on). Even the music was good, using 'The Mystic's Dream' by Loreena McKennitt as the theme. However, none of that could make up for the horrible butchering of the story, seemingly for entertainment's sake. Granted, I only saw that last 2 hours of the film. But after that, I have no intention of ever seeing that first 2. I won't spoil it for anyone that, for whatever cracked out reason, wants to see it, but when I saw Viviane's death, I became mildly violent. I'm actually getting fairly angry just remembering it, so I'll leave off by saying DON'T WATCH IT. At all. Especially (and I can't stress this enough), if you're a fan of the book.
