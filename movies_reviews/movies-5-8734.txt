The best comedy of the year! Don't listen to the critics who says it isn't sexy: This film is the most sexy I've seen on a long time [probably since Out of Sight] miles more sexy than the romantic film Notting Hill! Many cute girls one cute boy stars in this different comedy about boys sex. It's about being virgin what's the best technic to get laid: Should you say what you feel or try to play romantic soft? The message is obvious at the end: Soft is best in the length! Preper for real fun DON'T go with your parents! It's a generation film, like The Celebration, The Other Side of Sunday, Breaking the Waves probably also Idioterne, though I haven't seen that one yet... :-)
