Among the big screen comedies that starred first-generation SNL regulars, this one takes the prize. (And, in my opinion, only Caddyshack comes close.) The characters are unforgettable, the plot and writing excellect, and even random details of the movie have to be considered classic (ie. Bluto's shirt that just says COLLEGE).
