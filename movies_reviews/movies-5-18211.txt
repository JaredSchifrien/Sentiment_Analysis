By: Laur This movie was scary for the first time when I saw it all by myself. I didn't know what to aspect in all because I didnt even know what the movie was about. The movie confuses me between real and not real. Like the black and white part where the police officer is showing all the scrachtes on the walls and geos down into the house and the door opens and they both the sheriff and camera person die and it shoes a little piece of the leatherface man. Now I thought it was real until I went on the internet to find out the real story on it, and I found out that this movie was basically based on Ed Geins two killings and his house of dead women. I am still confused and think that the movie could be real, but then it's all made up sept for some parts. Like that Ed Gein wore the skin of his victims as mask, and find a woman hanging from the ceiling. I rate this film a 5-great becuase the movie sure did trick me cause I still think it's true and its all just about Ed Gein. If a movie can trick me like that is diserves a big number.
