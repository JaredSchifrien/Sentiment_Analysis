Like I've been saying since I saw it, this is the second best movie I've seen all year -- teetering on being the FIRST. Funny from start to finish, and I literally had goosebumps at how cool (action-wise) this movie was. Great buddy action-comedy, and dare I say it beat Rush Hour at the genre Rush Hour helped to create and make popular? I really hope this one helps to launch The Rock's career as an action star and people start to take him seriously because of the role. He did a superb job, yet people laugh and can't believe it when I say it if they haven't seen the movie.
