I really thought all the originality and humor from the original was gone. The story was basicly averege because it just had alot of the old shrek in it but with a Meet The Parents storyline which is very prdictable. The villians and the comical sidekicks are very dull since they have nothing funny to say. The only things funny things they say are coming from the voice actors instead of the script. Even the movie/pop refrences seemed out of place! SEE the original instead!
