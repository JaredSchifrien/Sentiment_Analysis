One star because of the music. I HATED this movie! What was the Academy high on when they made this win best picture? Leonardo DiCaprio can't even play dead, he's such a horrible actor. And no one else did much better. Plus, it was about three hours and fourteen minutes too long. If you don't get what I'm implying, please see me. It was such a pointless movie. I have no plans to ever see it again.
