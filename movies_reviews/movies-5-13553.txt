Out of all the films I have seen in my life none have ever touched me so deeply and intimatly as American Beauty. This film is my favorite film. I'm not just saying that, it actually changed how I saw things. I related most to Ricky Fitz the young man living next door to the Burnums. The honesty and gorgeouse story are only out shined by the powerful performances given by the best ensemble cast since Magnolia. Everytime Ricky gives the speech on all the beauty in the world I cry. It is so touching and so personal,I cannot see how people cannot be moved by its simple and never before touched message.I am glad this last best picture of the year of this decade was American Beauty. It was the perfect sumation of American life and our new found spirituality. I will always hold this film high as one of the best if not the best ever produced.It will always be in my heart. Sometimes...there's so much beauty...in this world...
