Wow, this is a brilliant film! First of all, I am a big fan of Nanette Fabray, who had a huge role in this movie. She did a fabulous job and is multi-talented: singing, dancing, acting, comedienne, etc. Fred Astaire was at his best and the storyline was both fun and intriguing. One of the best musicals ever made.
