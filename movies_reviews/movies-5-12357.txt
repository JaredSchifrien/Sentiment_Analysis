This movie paints an incredible picture of a gambling addict. John Anthony (McCoughnahay) is a stellar ex-college athlete who's career was ended by an injury. The guy sits around an office and is more or less miserable when he catches a big break due to his knack for sports gambling, and he goes from basically a farmboy to a NYC hot-shot overnight. He rises and falls quickly but he's not the guy with the problem - that's Walter (Pacino). He lives not for the thrill of victory but for the defeat. He explains that gambling addicts are not actually addicted to winning - it's losing that they crave. It's that moment when you know you've got it all on the line, everything you own is riding on one bet...nothing can match that high. Renee Russo is excellent in her supporting role as Walter's wife who refuses to give up on him.
