I actually like some of the Pokemon movies and recently I was very dissapointed in Yu-Gi-Oh the movie DAMNIT 4kids entertainment. WHY DIDNT YOU LEAVE YU-GI-OH THE WAY IT WAS. Anyway I don't like digimon to begin with and so I don't like this movie. It just sucks and it really is a Pokemon except without decent animation and at least some entertainment. The Digimon Movie is so bad it should'nt even have a rating. But I cant not give it a rating so I'll be nice and give it a 1.
