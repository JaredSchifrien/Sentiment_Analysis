One of the all time greats! THE BICYCLE THIEF is a film you simply cannot help but enjoy, even if you're afraid of subtitles. The visuals are poignant, poetic and touching. The picture is also one of neorealism's crowning achievements (and certainly DeSica's finest work). Anything less than 5 stars would be a sin.
