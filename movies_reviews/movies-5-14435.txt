This has been one of my favorite movies since it came out. It's great...this movie has it all; love, greed, violence. The characters in this movie make it great, as well as the actors that portray them. Sharon Stone's performance is the best I've ever seen by a female actor. You also have to love the time setting of the movie, the '70s and '80s clothing, cars, and houses. Every moment of this movie was entertaining, and you truly cared about what happened to the characters.
