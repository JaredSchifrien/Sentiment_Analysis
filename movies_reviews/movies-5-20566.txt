This is by far the best musical I have ever seen. Gene Kelly did a wonderful job and his singing/dancing skills were top notch! Donald O'Connor was halarious at many points in the film...and I would have to say I love the scene of Don and Kathy in Kathy's car when they first meet. When you're finished watching the film, you feel like going down the streets imitating Gene's 'Singin' in the Rain' scene. Would definetely recommend this movie to people of all ages.
