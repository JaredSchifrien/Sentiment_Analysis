No matter how old it may be, it's stil one of the greatest spine-tinglers ever created. Even the most courageous will still look behind him if he/she watches this one in the dark of night. Donald Pleseance is great in any role she plays. Jaime Lee was perfect because, let's face it......if John decided to just put some bimbo up there, it would look really stupid. Such a great soundtrack too. John really knew how to set the mood. Only few have reached the acclaim status of this masterpiece.
