Just like the first one, the second is a masterpiece. It has it all: great acting luscious landscapes, well writen plot (You can't go wrong with possibly the greatest books ever written), flow of the movie. What more could you want? t's also interesting to know that their saving the last part of the book for the third movie. I better see an oscar nod for best picture just like last year. Run to the theaters. I gaurantee you will want to see this movie again, and again, and again, and again, etc., etc., etc.
