I resisted watching this movie for so long mostly because of the title. I just thought it would be a really dumb unfunny picture. But after Big Daddy I was eager to see Adam Sandler's other movies, so I finally watched Happy Gilmore. I admit I was wrong! Never judge a book by its cover or a movie by its title I guess. Happy Gilmore is funny, fast-paced and good fun. There is even a hilarious scene with Bob Barker of the Price is Right.
