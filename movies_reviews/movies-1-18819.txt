As someone else said - great plot, potential - boring as an eternity in hell and acting that makes you want to claw your eyes out. Not British films best - however, Shaun of the dead is great. Would recommend not seeing 28 Days Later - it embarasses us Brits even more. Oh, and British soldiers are not like that.
