 Shadow of a Doubt is one of Hitchcock's greatest films, without question. Everything from the superb camera shots and angles to the brillant story-telling makes this a winner. It has everything; comedy, a budding love affair and Uncle Charly, portrayed by Joseph Cotten. It can't get any better than this!
