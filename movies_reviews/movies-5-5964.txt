This one is still ahead of today. The one-liners and racy dialogue alone are first-rate! Curtis is really great as a spoof of Cary Grant - men can learn a lot from how he seduces Marilyn, believe it or not. Lemmon is also great - his spastic energy makes the movie purr wonderfully. I'm amazed at the sexual candor. Like Breakfast at Tiffany's, Psycho, and other great movies from the beginning of the 60s, Hollywood was just beginning to explore sex in an adult way. The end line is classic. Anytime you see 2 straight adult male friends in drag (Bosom Buddies), you're seeing this movie.
