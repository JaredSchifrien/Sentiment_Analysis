I just rented this movie by mistake, started to watch it anyway. In our video store it was listed as a comedy. The first 30 minutes were pretty unfunny... but then there was a Ben Affleck soliloquy that was so poorly done -- horrible acting and horrible writing -- that it made me laugh so hard. I suddenly realized why it was listed as a comedy. I ran over here to the computer so I could give it a 5-star rating, but alas, RIA has it as a drama, so I guess I'll have to judge it from that perspective.
