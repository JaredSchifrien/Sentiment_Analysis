Alfred Hitchcock made many a great film, but if you are looking for the deepest example of his own artistic expression and personal fetishes, Vertigo is the film to see. The film is very mysterious and other-worldly. You almost feel as if you are in a dream. The vibrant colors are at once soothing but can be uneasy and, at times downright cruel. The ghosts and spirits of Alfred Hitchcock's dreams are displayed with startling perfection, in this one of the most important works of the cinema.
