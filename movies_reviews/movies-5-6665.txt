This is one of the better horror films ever made. Lon Chaney is bitten by a werewolf played by Bela Lugosi. He carries the curse and then during the full moon, oh you know what. Claude Rains plays Chaney's father, and a great part is played by Maria Ouspenskaya who plays the old gypsy who fortells Chaney's fate and attempts to care for him. I can't explain in this brief space how well done is this flick. Even the special effects and make-up are first rate for the date of the movie, 1941. You can sympathesize with the wolf man and really feel sorry for him, in fact. Don't miss this if you have a chance to see it!
