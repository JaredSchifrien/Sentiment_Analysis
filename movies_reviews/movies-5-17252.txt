A magnificent cinematic achievement. For those who find it too long or have trouble reading the subtitles, I recommend watching the U.S. remake The Magnificent Seven the day before. The plots are similar enough and Kurosawas direction and the casts acting is so good that if you have difficulty with the subtitles you won't lose track.
