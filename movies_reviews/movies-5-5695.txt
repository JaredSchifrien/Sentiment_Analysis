A friend of mine used to be crazy about this movie all her teenaged and adult life. She tried to get me to watch it, but I thought it would be old and boring. I started my love affair with GWTW qne month ago and I have watched the movie at least once a week since then. It just keeps getting better. I am reading the book and now I am a GWTW junkie. I have watched and read Scarlett and they are the perfect compliment to both the original book and movie.Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable were a perfect match for the film.Truly the greatest love story ever told!
