All sorts of great, british, odd, witty fun!!!!! You really will laugh unless you have no sense of humor or are terribly boring. There are so many good one liners and puns I can't even tell you. The best scenes are Galahad the pure, run away, and the little troll man at the bridge. Great movie and it comes highly recommended.
