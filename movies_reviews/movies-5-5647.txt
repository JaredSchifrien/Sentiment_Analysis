great movie with Katherine Hepburn, and Humphrey Bogart. I put off seeing this movie because I did not think I would like it. this turned out to be a good movie. Katherine Hepburns character is a missionary in Africa with her brother during world war 1. Humphrey Bogart is sort of a mailman who delivers goods to this area. Rosie's brother dies after an attack on the village and Charlie helps get Rosie out of the area and down the river on the African Queen his steam boat.they go through some adventures along the way dealing with the treacherous river, and end up caring for each other even though they are very different in personalities. Both actors do a very good job and Humphrey Bogart even won the oscar for his role.
