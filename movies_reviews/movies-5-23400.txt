If you do not know who Ed Harris is, this movie includes a great acting job by him. The Abyss is not only a sci-fi movie that brings in exciting fantasy, but also a futuristic film that examines science experiments (some of which have yet to be attempted). This film has great social commentary from both a human and an extraterrestrial perspective.
