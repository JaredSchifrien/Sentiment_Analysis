A pleasant and welcome return of Sam Raimi to films dealing with the supernatural. This in my opinion was on of the best films of the year. With blistering good performances from an all star ensemble cast, this movie really packs a heavy punch. Of course Cate Blanchette steals the show in an as always genious performance as a widowed mother of three young boys in southern Alabama(I think). She makes money by giving people Readings. She gives these by using a deck of cards that have different symboles on the face side. She starts to have strange visions during the day and while she sleeps that there is some foul play going on in her little town. This film is propleeled by it's great performance, uncanny ability to keep the story up to speed and thought provoking and its beautiful directing by a true master, Sam Raimi. The cast includes such talents as Greg Kinnear, Hillary Swank, Katie Holmes, Keanu Reeves ( exibiting acting abilities that must have been hidden for all these years) and the second best performance in the movie coming from a very under rated actor Giovanni Ribisi. His performance in this movie is captivating and very real. A well done, naturalistic murder mystery/supernatural thriller. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. If you like brilliant acting, story telling and great film making treat yourself to a very good little sleeper.
