People, people, people, what is going on here?! At the time of this message Tommy Boy is the LAST on this List!! You can't imagine how sad this makes me, never as I was casually scrolling down the page did I expect to see this. Tommy Boy...last in line, (head down as I say that). I was looking for The Cable Guy thinking a lot of people think that was a dark comedy and therefore half expected it to be at the end but Tommy Boy, uh this is terrible. Let's just recap a few scenes here shall we? Did I hear a niner in there Richard (D. Spade) asking Tommy about the phone number he called. When Tommy loses it in during the sales meeting and smashes the guys toy cars and Spade says as they're leaving that guy..might not call us Or in the motel room Richard whose your favorite little rascal? Alfalfa, or is it Spanky?...sinner Deer scene, fat guy in a little coat, side of the road fight, then in the restaurant hey Richard is there a mark on my face? nope are you sure cause it really hurts right along here nope, nothing Great movie, terrible loss that Farley dying and all but then again did anyone really expect him to last that long.
