What a great movie. Cary Grant is so funny that I turn purple every single time I watch the movie. I love his quick faces when he is stumbling on what to say those poor old ladies. It was just down right funny and pure great entertainment! Teddy was the best charecter ever in that whole movie and I believe he is one of the greatest movie charecters ever been made.
