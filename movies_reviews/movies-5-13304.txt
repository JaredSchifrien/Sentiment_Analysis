Wow! This movie made me realize how not glamorous war is. Everything about it was outstanding. The acting was A+++, however the directing was incredible! This project had a dream team duo with Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg. This movie will go down as one of the greatest movies ever, along with Forrest Gump.
