Very few modern horror/suspense movies have the ability to both scare and appeal to the imagination and intellect at the same time (yes, a film can require the use of your mind AND still be considered a Horror movie). This one grabs you on every level. And to think they did it without dragging you through the gutter or a constant blood bath. Now that's great good cinema!
