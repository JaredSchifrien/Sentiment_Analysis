The classic horror movie, The Exorcist was completely revolutionary when it came out and set a new standard in the evolution of the horror movie. How many movies before or since have had audiences running from the cinema screaming in terror? Unlike many of the weak horror films from the 80s and 90s, it doesn't rely on blood, murders, axes, psychos and close up graphic shots of mutilation. The horror and fear is in the battle between good, represented by a tired, doubting priest, and the ultimate evil, coming from a cute, innocent young girl. The first few times I saw it, it was indeed frightening. Now it looks somewhat dated, not surprising considering it was produced so long ago, but even now it can hold up as one of the top horror movies of all time. Forget the sequels though they were dreadul!
