I m definitely not a big fan of foreign cinema, but Life is Beautiful is something special. This is one of those rare movies that s almost perfectly put together every single scene is an integral part of the overall movie. The story is incredibly moving. And Roberto Benigni's performance was truly worthy of the Oscar he won it s impossible not to get attached to his character Guido, a father who relies on his amazing imagination to prevent his son from suffering while they are prisoners in a Nazi concentration camp. Who would have thought someone could make a funny movie about the Holocaust, while never once detracting from the seriousness of the tragedy?
