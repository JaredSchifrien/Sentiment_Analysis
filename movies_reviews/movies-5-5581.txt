Casablanca was one of the first classic movies I had ever seen. I was 16 and thought that Casablanca may not reach my expectations after having 50-odd years of so-called hype. Let me just say that I was thoroughly, completely, and utterly wrong. No other film that I have seen--both past and present--has so percisely, beautifully, and understatedly communicated the sacrifices made, and the desperation felt by Europeans during the WWII-era.
