Incredibly funny movie, with a spectrum of humor from lowbrow slapstick to witty parody. The I speak jive, I like my coffee black like my men, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, and the crazy dude in the control tower are just a few of many gems of priceless comedy. For continuous laughs, few movies trump Airplane.
