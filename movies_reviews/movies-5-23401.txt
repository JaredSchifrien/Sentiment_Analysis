GREAT as usual for James Cameron. But, what's better, what amplifies the story and gives a closer view of all the cool characters is the special edition DVD. You get two version in one fabulous looking seal. One version is better than the other (theatrical version). Sure, the movies released in theaters had laughs and other forms of entertainment, and was heart-wrenching at the end (between actors Ed Harris and Mary Mastrontonio)... but, I prefer seeing giant waves overwhelm the coasts of all the countries, giving those aliens some sinister personality. It's a remarkable ending, with even cooler effects than those aliens themselves. I give 5 stars to the DVD.
