Yes, yes, yes, fantastic movie. Hitchcock's 4th best and in the Top 50 for sure. Best movie of the 40 besides Double Indemnity and The Great Dictator (see those movies). Interesting plot, best Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman performances of their careers. (woooo! casablanca! play it again, sam! no, she's better in notorious!). Claude Rains is particulary great as well but his performance in Mr. Smith... could be better. I wish I were more opinionionitive.
