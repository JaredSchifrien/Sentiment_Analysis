I have seen all the rocky films hundreds of times and i still dont get bored watching them it's very hard to say witch rocky is the best many people find the 5th one to be quite crap but that might just be cause there was to many of them i'm sure that if that was the 2nd or 3rd rocky film people wouldnt find it crap. what better story could you ask for but a no name guy to world icon because he went the distance with the champ. when stallone made the film he had got the idea from a Muhammad Ali fight (i cant rember who it was ali fought) but he was inspired because that Ali's apponent was taking so much of a beating and he keep cumming back to fight and avetually knocked the champ down. stallone went home and for three days strait wrote the entier rocky script he even rote the fighting manovers they where going to use. i have heard there's a 6th one comming out i hope it dose aswell as the others.
