I would like to say that this is an outstanding movie, true to the X-men fans of the last 30+ years. Unfortunately, my religious convictions don't allow me to lie. The story was sophomoric (freshmoric actually, but that isn't a word). The fight scenes were so poorly choreographed, I thought I was watching Superman (you know, the Christopher Reeves movie). The casting was excellent; too bad the actors didn't have anything with which to work. Hopefully this is simply the first issue intro into a better series. (Boy, am I glad I went to a matinee.)
