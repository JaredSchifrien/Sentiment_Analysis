What a piece of formulatic crap. This movie is just another example that Hollywood has run out of ideas. It serves no purpose other that to have talentless actors showcase their bland personalities in a badly written script, and to highlight current rap music that no one will remember in 5 years (except Missy Elliot). The dancing is nothing new, and the plot is overused. This will probably make some impact at the box office, but that just goes to show the intelligence of the movie going public. I know this isn't supposed to be art, but formula movies should show SOME effort to be unique and different
