Akira Kurosawa wanted to make a film that was, in his words, good enough to eat. He certainly accomplished this because SEVEN SAMURAI is one of the most entertaining movies ever made, if not the most entertaining movie of all-time! It's all there, the technical mastery of Kurosawa, the steelar performances of Shimura and Mifune.....there is too much to say! This film is so good, I can't possibly display my affections for it in one of two small paragraphs. The greatness of SEVEN SAMURAI is beyond words.
