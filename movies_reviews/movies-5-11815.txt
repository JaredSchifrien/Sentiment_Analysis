I thought this movie was very very good, it was hilarious. Frankie Muniz and Mandy Moore did the voice of two bear cubs. Eddie Murphy did a great job and the movie had a little surprise that you have to think about for a minute before it registers what happened, if you go and see it I think you will know what I'm talking about.
