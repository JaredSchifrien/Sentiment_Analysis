Here we have David Lean again. This movie goes on too long but it has everything you need--romance, heartbreak, nobility, betrayal, action etc. Pasternak's work is well done. I didn't like Omar Sharif in the title role in the 1960's but he has grown on me over the decades and I am satisfied in his role as the doc. The characters are too English however, but so what, I guess.
