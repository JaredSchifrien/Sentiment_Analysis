I saw a sneak preview of What A Girl Wants, and here is my review. This film contains the usual plot of girl wants to reunite with her birth father. In this case, the father lives in a posh mansion in England, and the girl is coming from a hip community in America. She meets dad, wins his trust, falls in love with another boy, gets into a catfight with the boy's other girlfriend, and the film is over. That is what to expect (mostly) from this film. Amanda Bynes should not have signed on to do this film, because it's even below HER (oh my god..did I just say that!). It's really that bad. It could've been better. It's not Amanda's fault though. It's the screenplay, and the material that the actors are given. Both Colin Firth and Kelly Preston aren't given adequate screen time to make their cases, so it seems like a one-dimensional storyline for Amanda's character. Plus, the storyline wanders off far too many times, and there are a few too many limp one liners that could make everyone in the audience nauceous! The boy-meets-girl storyline may appeal to teenage girls, but the rest does not click. What A Girl Wants isn't.
