As most of you have gathered from my weblist, I'm a huge, unabashed Disney fan. This is truly my favorite and one of the best in my opinion. A sweet story paired with fantastic, unique voicework that brought to life unforgettable characters. And who can forget the wonderful, fun music? I will admit sometimes Disney films are blandly entertaining but this one had the spunk and fun to reach many age groups, creating a lasting cartoon classic.
