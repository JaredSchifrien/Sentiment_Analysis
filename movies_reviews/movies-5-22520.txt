The legendary warrior Conan (Schwarzenegger) begins his epic quest when Conans mother was killed in front of him by Thulsa Doom, then he is sold for slavery. He gets very huge and angry as he pushes the wheel of pain, at this point he is pissed off at CRUM his god. he finally gets released into the wild (bad idea) as he takes over the land and seeks revenge of the death of his mother, and to have his own kingdom with sex slaves. he gets laid quite a few times along the journey and he only eats meat!!! He meets up with Valeria who is also a great warrior but i'd like to think that he just kept her around for a peice of ass. He kills a horny witch along the way (erotic), gets crucified, sneaks into a chamber and kills all the guard and servants, and finally he meets up with Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones, Darth Vader) and chops off his head in front of all his people then throws it off the altar. Conan finally avenges the death of his mother and his people. He then goes on to rule his own kingdom but thats another story.....5 stars... go rent at blockbuster or hollywood before Conan whacks your head off too.
