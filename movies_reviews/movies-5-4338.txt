 Shrek would still be excellent entertainment even without the voice of Eddie Murphy, but it wouldn t have sparkled quite as much. This state of the art animated film never ceased to amaze and amuse on several levels at once. One of the most impressive things about it was the very realistic attention to detail. Facial expressions were especially impressive and spoke volumes about the personality of each character. Even the lighting was so oddly real looking I noticed a couple of times what appeared to be lens spot glare. Young children will enjoy the action and the characters but won t get much of the more off the wall stuff at this point. Since it appears to have all the earmarks of a future classic most of them will no doubt be watching Shrek with their own families one-day.
