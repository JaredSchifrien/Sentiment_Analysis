I thought this movie was wonderful. I think people need to remember that it is just a movie, not required to be completely accurate. Everyone has their interpretation of history anyway. I've never read so many pious comments. I have a history degree and know enough to say that there is a bit of truth in both sides. Maybe every British general wasn't brutal, but some were. After all, we are Americans and are allowed to portray the bad guy on whichever side we choose. Please people, lighten up. Mel Gibson gave us another movie with substance when we're surrounded by these beyond stupid teeny bopper movies. I thank him.
