Epic, archetypal, perfect in keeping with the power, drama, and message of the original writings. Combine all that with the superior acting, special effects, and attention to detail and this is the best epic since Star Wars. I have seen other attempts at making these books into movies, and they fell FAR short of what I imagined when I read them, but THIS series... this is better than I remembered, perfect in every way, inspirational, heart warming, hopeful, inspirational, what more could you ask for!!!
