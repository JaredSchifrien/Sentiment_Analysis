Very fresh fantasy. Takes an almost childlike, yet sophisticated approach to dark heroes the way we wanted to see them before we grew up and lost our sense of wonder. Using mostly villainous characters in protagonist roles makes them seem more complex/realistic as people.Good effects, great almost dizzy pace-really fun!
