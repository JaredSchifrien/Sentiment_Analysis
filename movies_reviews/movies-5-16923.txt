Ralph Fiennes shows why he is the greatest actor of our generation. He plays three characters from 3 generations of the same Hungarian family. All three have compelling and engrossing stories that span the major events of the twentieth century. If you like historical dramas, definitely check this one out. Jennifer Ehle and William Hurt also deliver great performances. This is not a movie for children and it is rather long but well worth the effort.
