Being a fan of Raymond Chandler, it's natural to be a little apprehensive to watch one of his mystery novels on the big screen. The Big Sleep does not disappoint! It covers as much in the novel that Hays office would allow in the true style of film noir. Chandler's Philip Marlowe was a role Bogart was born to play and the heat between him and Bacall rises off the screen in waves. The dialogue is sharp and has a real 'rat-a-tat-tat' to it. The acting is as undramatic and genuine as it could be in the 1940's. Personally, I prefer this film to The Maltese Falcon . Although Maltese.. is a perfect study in 'film noir', The Big Sleep is the premiere study in it.
