Amongst comedy movies, this is the equivalent of The Godfather. Mel Brooks' greatest movie, by far. I must have seen it at least a dozen times, and I still convulse when I hear the horse neigh and winny whenever the name Blucher is said. It's in my Top-5, with Animal House, Caddyshack, Airplane, and Holy Grail (Amazing that all of my Top-5 are all 25 years or older).
