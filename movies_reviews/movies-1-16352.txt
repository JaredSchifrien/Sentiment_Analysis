This was a horrible movie. I actually went and saw it at the theater, mainly because of good ratings it had received and intrigued by the storyline. I did not care about one person in this film, good or bad feelings, could not tell you any one characters name. Mark Wahlberg may be the stiffest actor in the history of cinema. It basically had no storyline, just little snippets into the lives of porn actors, not even interesting pieces at that. After it came out there was talk about Burt Reynolds winning a Best Supporting actor for his part? LOL What did he have? maybe 20 lines? I am college educated and appreciate well done and unique movies, but I really am curious what professional movie reviewers see when they review a film and why they rated this so high.
