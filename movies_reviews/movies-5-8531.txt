The Jerk is a classic Steve Martin comedy movie. I'm sure anyone who has seen it knows at least one of of the oh-so-many fabulous and funny quotes from it. If you're looking for a great comedy movie suitable for one person, two people, a family, I recommend watching it. I've always been a Steve Martin fan myself, along with a horde of others, and I must say that the Jerk is, in my opinion, on of his best films.
