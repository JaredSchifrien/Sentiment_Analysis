Good movie Jack Nicholson was great as Macmurphy was commited into a mental institution for being a troublemaker he continues to cause trouble by disrupting Nurse Ratchets section of the mental ward. Louise is good as the cold controlling nurse. There are a lot of funny scenes. and some sad ones as well. I like the part with MAc Murphy makes friends with the Chief. there were some good actors in this well done movie.
