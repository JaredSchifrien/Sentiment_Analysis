Froda and sam hardly ever fight any thing, they go on a big safari draging a bald kate moss with no make up along with them. They can barely make it up the mountain cause frodo keeps passing out like he's got a dodgy red lobster wanting to come up, and yet these two seem to be the ultimate heros. The real heros are the others left to deal with all the Iraqi insurgents on prehistoric elephants. Food for thought.
