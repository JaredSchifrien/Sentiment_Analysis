Never having been a big fan of Superhero movies, I was quite impressed with this one. The movie ended with me being satisfied. Toby McGuire was the perfect choice to play the nerdy Peter Parker who is bitten by a spider, transforming him into a super hero. William Defoe was also the perfect choice to play the Green Goblin. I love the movie's comical scenes too, as well as its sad ones and the love story between Peter Parker and MJ (typical superhero movie stuff). A great movie- the best movie ever to be based on comic books!
