This has to be one of the most cleverly thought up sci-fi movies of all time (perhaps maybe star wars), the storyline was great and the special effects are in a class of their own. I can't wait till the sequel, the only probelm I had with the movie was the goofy love story between Neo and Trinity.....what a laugh.
