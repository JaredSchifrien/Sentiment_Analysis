I would say I've watched this start to finish at least 60 times. No kidding. I always wished I could have went to school with these guys. They looked like they were having so much fun. The songs were great, and the chemistry between Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta was excellent. In fact, the whole cast was just about perfect.
