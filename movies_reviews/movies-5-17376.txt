What an amazing film! The first time I saw this, I thought it was far too long and FAR too heavy on dialogue. After revisiting it in my mind, however, it soon dawned on me exactly how remarkable Renoir's vision was, here. THE RULES OF THE GAME is a masterpiece, perhaps second only to CITIZEN KANE in the pantheon of cinema giants.
