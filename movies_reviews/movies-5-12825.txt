A well done, most amusing and revealing view of one of the major figures of American underground popular culture. The main point of the film: dysfunctionality in the family often leads to genius in the progeny, and usually engenders gross eccentricity, to boot. When you see this film, you can't help but feel so sorry for Crumb's brother Charles, who was a very significant influence on the cartoonist.
