Great cast. Good story line, but a bit predictable. Surprised the two main characters didn't share the same love interest. Very refreshing to see a movie with a predominantly Black cast show something positive, without the violence, drugs, and sex. There is no defeatist attitudes abounding in this movie, and it gives people a chance to see the wonderful paegentry of the Marching Bands of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities.
