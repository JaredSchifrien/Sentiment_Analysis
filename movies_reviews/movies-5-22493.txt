One of the most dark and gritty movies of the sci-fi genre, Blade Runner never ceases to impress. Ridley Scott's meticulous attention to detail makes for great cinema. The cinematography is something to behold. Besides that it has a great script to back it up. Rutger Hauer is positively wicked as the villian Roy Batty. He has one of the best lines in movie history at the edn of the film. All my memories, lost like teardrops in the rain, time to die. Harrison Ford plays a good foil to Hauer's insane villain. He's great as the seasoned pro Deckart who has doubt about what he has to do to the replicants.
