Steven Spielberg hired Tobe Hooper to direct Poltergeist because of this film. Nuff said. Influential, disturbing and brilliantly directed (and edited). You can skip the needless recent remake, the sequels and a bizarre remake with Renee Zellweger and Matthew Mc (I won't even try to spell his last name).
