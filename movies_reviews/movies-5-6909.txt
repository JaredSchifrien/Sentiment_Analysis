Released in 1980, Airplane! is the classic Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker parody of the disaster movies that were all the rage during the 1970's (eg Towering Inferno, The Poseidon Adventure and obviously the airplane crash movies). Our hero is ex-military pilot Ted Striker (Robert Hays) who is now afraid of flying; however, he chases down his estranged girlfriend who is a stewardess, Elaine Dickinson (Julie Hagerty). During the flight, food poisoning knocks out the flight crew and many of the passengers forcing Striker to fly and land the plane. Helping Striker are glue-sniffing controller McCroskey (Lloyd Bridges), his old military captain Rex Kramer (Robert Stack), and Dr. Rumack (Leslie Nielsen) who just happens to be on board the flight and did not eat the fish. With this structure, the film goes through constant puns, slapstick, and outrageous dialogue along the lines of The Naked Gun as our heroes must deal with an uncooperative autopilot, screaming passengers, a singing nun, religious zealots, and all the other stereotypes from the disaster genre. To catch all the gags, multiple viewings are necessary as usually there is something going on in the background that is often missed the first go-round. The bottom line is that, for good or ill, Airplane! is the film that started this type of over the top parody film and for that reason (if no other) this movie is a landmark release.
