I hated this movie. I hated even more the fact I spent $16 for my boyfriend and I to see it in the theater. The first half of the movie may be somewhat tolerable, if at all. That's when all the funny things happen between Hudson and McConaughy. The last half is absolutely atrocious, when you are just sitting there waiting for the stupid characters to find out whats going on and continue with the overplayed Hollywood ending. When are movie makers going to realize that if they are going to make a movie with an obvious ending that they at least need to make it somehow different and entertaining and give us characters we actually care about???
