Citizen Kane is a cinema work of art. It's a masterpiece. They just don't make movies like this one anymore. Furthermore one must admire not only Orson Welles talent and geniousness but how young he was when he made the film. How many people in their 20's were making films that would make history? The story of Citizen Kane is a timeless one. Charles Foster Kane goes from rags to riches you could say, but never really finds happiness. It's the story of one man despite his wealth and power is never really secure. The movie works on so many levels because of Orson Welles, the great storyline, the wonderful cast with Joseph Cotton, Everett Sloan, Agnes Moorehead, Ray Collins, Ruth Warrick,and Dorothy Comingore, and because of Welle's genius lighting and camera work. It should be a must see for any movie fan.
