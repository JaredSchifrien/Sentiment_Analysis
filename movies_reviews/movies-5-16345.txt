I agree totally with Kamylienne. This movie was just simply spectacular. The acting was the best Ive ever seen. The picture and costumes looked realistic and were amazing. The torture scenes were extremely violent. I don't think this movie was at all exaggerated. It simply shows how Jesus died in real life. I wasn't really interested in seeing this movie until I heard exactly how violent it was and someone even died from watching it. This movie is extremely sad; to watch how humans could do such things to one another. Some people in the audience were even crying. Mel Gibson wanted this to be a powerful movie, and it by far is, so it gets an easy 5 stars. Whether or not this is an accurate film does not matter. No one knows what exactly happened. Its not a documentary or a history lesson. Its simply a lesson about Christ's final hours. This movie deserves a much higher rating, espacially when it is selling out nation wide.
