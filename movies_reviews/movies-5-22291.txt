When I was a kid in the 60s, dinosaurs rocked my world. Alas, any movie depiction of dinos back then were so cheesy that even I as an 8-year-old thought to myself, LAMOSAURUS. I read Crichton's book before there was any talk of a film adaptation and liked it. I saw they film when it first debuted and was thoroughly impressed, no, amazed at the Dinosaurs. They were the star of the movie. The Tyrannosaurus that ate the selfish lawyer while he sat on the crapper should have won best actor award. Best supporting actor should have went to the Dilophosaurus that did Newman in (I bet Seinfeld wishes he was a Dilophosaurus). The human cast was OK. Laura Dern looked particularly great in shorts. Spielberg did a magnificaent adaptation and for a couple of hours, convinced me that dinosaurs were alive. Sequels are worth seeing but don't match up to JP.
