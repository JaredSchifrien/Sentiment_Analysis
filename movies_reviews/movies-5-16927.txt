Maybe it's just me, but I found this film, all in all, to be pretty much flawless. I thought that Josh Hartnett was completely convincing in his role as the insecure Hugo, who is jealous of the star of the school's basketball team, so he unleashes a flawless plan to ruin his life. From the beginning, a wonderful plot unfolds and what follows is an amazing story of jealousy, insecurity and mind manipulation. I really can't say much about Julia Stiles and Mekhi Pfeiffer except that they were OK in this film, but Josh Hartnett as Hugo definately stole the show. His eyes were darkened, and as the audience, I was able to sense that he wasn't all there after listening him talk for a few minutes. The ending will disappoint most who watch this film, not because it isn't well done, but its just not what you would want an ending to be, espescially when all of it was caused by one sick teenager's insecurities. Truly, it all could have been prevented, but Hugo (Hartnett) is the master manipulater, and he is able to find several accomplices throughout the film, including the very person whose life he is planning on ruining. It's a true tragedy, and rarely have I seen a movie consisting of what I call teen actors which was as compelling as O . Highly reccomended!
