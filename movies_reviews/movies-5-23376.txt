I loved this movie! I've never been a major fan of Charlie Kaufman or Jim Carrey, but this was something special. Although the plot may be far fetched, the human emotions were very real to life. A magic movie that kept me thinking about it for days afterwards. I wish more people would see it with an open mind!
