I have to put it down as the movie that made me close my eyes the most of any movie I've seen. In space, no one can hear you scream, the ads said back in '79, but there was sure a lot of screaming in the theater that day. That damn cat Jonesy was as scary as the freakin' Alien. Horrorific aside, there was sexiness to the movie. Both girls on the Nostramo were dolls. The sight of Sigourney Weaver in bikini panties nearly getting her rump patted by the Alien was raw sexiness followed by sheer terror. It was a great movie.
