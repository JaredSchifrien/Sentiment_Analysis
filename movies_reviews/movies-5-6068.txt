Leonard Bernstein's magnificent setting of Romeo and Juliet. It is possibly as well known in the U.S. as is the Shakespeare play on which it is based. Contains some of the finest music ever composed for a musical, with tunes which are engaging, memorable, contrapuntal and brilliantly orchestrated. An amazing tour-de-force by one of the most talented musicians ever to live in the U.S.
