A very clever movie that actually makes you think - and keeps you guessing. Kevin Spacey is fantastic as Verbal and Pete Postlethwaite is at his usual high standard acting. The juxta postioning makes the suspense even greater and keeps your mind ticking over. My favourite part is the end where Verbal leaves and the policeman works the case out by looking at his noticeboard as everything that Verbal said was on there and you had the voiceover. Absolutely fantastic and a film to treasure.
