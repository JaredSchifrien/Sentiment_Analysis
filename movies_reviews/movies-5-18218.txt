This was the first movie I've ever seen that made my knees shake. I think the most terrifying thing about it was the fact that it was based on a true story -- I mean, this actually happened and the perp was never caught. I disagree with Kamylienne, however, who said that the story was loosely based on the story of the serial killer Ed Gein. First of all, Thomas Hewitt (the real Leatherface) was not really a serial killer but more like a mass murderer. He didn't choose his victims in a way that made sense -- he simply murdered whomever came along next. Secondly, Ed Gein was a killer in Wisconsin (my home state) who was only proven to have killed two women. Technically, Gein was not a serial killer, but he was a cannibal. There are a few striking similarities between the two men (one being their rather gruesome ability to sew human skin) but this movie was definitely not based on Gein. All in all, this is a very clever film and I definitely recommend it if you want to come out of the theater trembling in terror.
