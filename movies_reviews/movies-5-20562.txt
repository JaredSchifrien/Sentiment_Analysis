The best thing about this movie is Jean Hagen! She did a great acting job of NOT being able to act! And, for all you trivia buffs, in the scene where Debbie dubs Jean's voice...it is actually Jean's real voice you hear. So ultimately, it was Jean dubbing Debbie dubbing Jean. This movie is one of the best all-around movies ever made. The acting was brilliant and the writing was top notch.
