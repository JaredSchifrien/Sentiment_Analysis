I didn't find this movie to be interesting at all. It's just absolutely ridiculous. It makes you think about what you'd do if a huge meteor were about to kill everyone on the planet, but that's all it's good for. It's not entertaining, it's just stupid as the course of action the world leaders take to attempt to save the earth is about as logical as letting a Satanist give a sermon on Easter Sunday.
