How rare is it to come across an Oscar-worthy action movie, let alone one that appeals to both men and women? Braveheart is a rare creation. Mel Gibson, who also directed the movie, brings the spirit of William Wallace to life. I have no sense of the historical accuracy, and it's always kind of annoying when movies portray an entire country (England, in this case) as 100% evil, but other than that Braveheart has few flaws. Great action scenes, high quality acting, two beautiful women, a dramatic story with good guys to root for and bad guys to hate - Braveheart has it all, including a message about freedom that somehow manages to get through without being overly corny. Even a good historical action movie like Gladiator can't hold a candle to Braveheart - further testimony to Gibson's achievement.
