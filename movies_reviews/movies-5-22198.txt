The Matrix is by far one of the best and most unique new sci-fi movies there is. The combination of brand new photographic and CGI (computer generated imaging) technologies, plus a stupefying storyline create a movie that is a feast for the eyes and the mind. Watching it for the first time is like being hit with a ton of bricks that leave you dumbfounded and aching for more! With just the right combination of sci-fi, kick-ass fight scenes, romance, and betrayal, this movie has everything a viewer could want (though I wouldn't watch some parts with a weak stomach). Plus, depth of meaning that underlies the story is astounding. Just like the rabbithole the viewer can take the story as far a they want to go. I took the plunge, and let me tell you, WHOA, it's worth it! The Matrix is definitely worth a look, if not a second, or a third!
