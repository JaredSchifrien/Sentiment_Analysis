Not only was Chaplin amazingly brave to make and release this movie, but it was also very very funny. He managed to make a movie mocking one of the most dangerous leaders in the world and also managed to make it hilarious that even Hitler allowed it to be seen in Germany. I recomend this movie to anyone who is either into history or into classic laughtastic comedy.
