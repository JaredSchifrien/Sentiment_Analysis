Some people call it corny or saccharine -- I disagree.Remember that the movie was made almost 40 years ago, a time when it wasn't a crime for a movie to have a happy ending. The story of a nun sent to be a governess for the captain's children only to end up marrying him and escaping from the Nazis sounds like a plot too improbable for the critics -- but the plot is true! I know that, although I like it very much myself, the music is not to everyone's taste, but what music is? All in all, although it's not my favourite movie, it's certainly in my personal top ten.
