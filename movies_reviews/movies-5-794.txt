This movie was freaky. I didn't want to be alone for days! Ahh, I still think of it and get freaked out. The thing that makes this scary is that we don't know if it could actually happen! It was brillantly done. I didn't even know the ending until it happend, it was such a twist! I recommend it to anyone that likes to be scared.
