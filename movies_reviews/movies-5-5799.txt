A trully brilliant film. I saw it for the first time in a government class in the 8th grade, and it has been my all time favorite film ever since. The debate, the arguments, the analysis of evidence, the overall psychological drama. I fell in love with it. This film convinced me that I wanted to become an attorney. I understand there is a play form of this film. Where could I find it?
