Every citizen of this once great country should be required to watch The Patriot. The movie brilliantly demonstrates why we have the 2nd Amendment in the Bill of Rights of our Constitution. Too many people have sacrificed everything to make available the freedoms we enjoy today. The forces at work to take them away from us must be stopped in their tracks. As far as historical accuracy, read about the Battle of Cowpens. You will find that the historic Battle of Cowpens was a much more one sided victory for the Continentals than the movie suggests!
