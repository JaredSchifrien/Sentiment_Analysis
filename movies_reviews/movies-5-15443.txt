This is a very art-house film and isn't something for everyone. I wasn't sure if a film about a twenty-three-year-old dying was going to be interesting and was hesitant about hiring such a film. I made a right choice as this film is amazing. Sarah Polley (Go) gave a very tender and emotional performance of a young woman dying and trying to do things shes never done before during her final days on earth. I can understand why she didn't make the choice to tell her family as she didn't want a pity party, but if you don't well-up as she makes a tape for her two children for their Birthday each year right up to the age of eighteen, then you missed a very sensitive part of the film.
