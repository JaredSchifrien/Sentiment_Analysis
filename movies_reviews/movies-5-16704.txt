Through its use of well defined characters, The Color of Money allows viewers to peek into a world that is foreign to most, and humanizes these people who hustle or con their way through life. The well written script hints at what a hustler might be like: cold, calculating, indifferent to anything except their own desires. The audience sees how a hustler's life may be exciting, but mostly it's empty and shallow because they always must keep their guard up and watch their own back.
