Hollywood Sci-Fi is usually spaceships, laser guns a hero, a love interest and some kind of chase scene or two. Blade Runner is sci-fi in its truest form and that is down to a few factors, firstly it was adapted from a book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K Dick, a man who knew nothing other than his paranoid vision of the future and regardless of his troubled personal life, he wrote great sci-fi. Secondly Ridley Scott, a genius, a man who can not only see in his mind how a scene will work but a man who has proved that his visual skills are what it takes to make a great movie time and time again (Gladiator, Alien, Thelma Louise) - then there are other people like Hampton Fancher, Syd Mead, Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young etc. etc. add to that lot a hauntingly beautiful musical score by Vangelis and you've got the basis for a great movie. Then on top of this you have carefully selected elements like props, lighting, photography, violence, romance, vehicles, silence and noise that forms the interactive ambience that very few films can boast. I have lost count of how many times I have seen this film and everytime it drags me in, fixates me with its morals, questioning humanity and general insecurity which perhaps is its winning ingredient, deep down we all ask ourselves What is real?
