Oh my god. This piece of crud was the most overhyped and overated thing I ever seen. Renee Zellwegger needs to leave the singing business. The music score was terrible. Catherine Zeta Jones can not dance or sing at all. She needs to stick to speaking roles. As for Queen Latifah, She was well in her role, but she's the only good thing that happened to this movie. Seriously, none of the characters are likable. Roxie Heart is as pretty as a donkey's vas deferens and as talented at singing as a screeching bat.
