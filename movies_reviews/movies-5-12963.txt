This is easily one of my top 10 movies. Tim Robbins shows that modesty and persistence in bad situations can help one come out on top. I fell in love with Morgan Freeman's character for his realization that conforming to the norms (e.g., trying to convince parole officers of his remorse for crimes he committed as a youth) may not be the best way to reach one's goals. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins were a fabulous match.
