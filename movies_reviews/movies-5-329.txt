Gladiator deserves 5 stars. I love the fighting scenes, plot, and actors. Russell Crowe was great. But the actor that impress me was Joaquin Phoenix. He was an excellent villain. He killed his father, tried to sleep with his sister, and taunt Maximus. I am disappointed that Joaquin did not win a best supporting actor for this movie.
