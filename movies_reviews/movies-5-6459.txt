Next to Citizen Kane this is Orson Welles other great film, but more fun to watch. Welles is spectacular as the corrupt overweight cop. Charles Heston is not convincing as a Mexican narcotics agent but its kind of funny to see him look like one. Janet Leigh is really good as his wife and makes her first encounter to a nervous motel manager(played brilliantly by Dennis Weaver) Joseph Cotten and Marlena Dietrich make amusing cameos. Classic film noir.
