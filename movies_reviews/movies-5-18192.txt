the best of george's living dead series. dispite what some people may think, this movie is brilliant. ok, what would you do if the world was being taken over by zombies? you could either a- hold down the fort or b- get out and go to...the mall. i'd go to the mall, i mean you have everything there, food, guns,a safe place to sleep, friends, and hundreds of push-over zombies that will bring you endless fun taking out. what more could you ask for? i especially like the part when the small town got together and had almost like a festival for killing the undead, and when our zombie in plaid got a little to friendly with a helicopter propeller. endless laughs in this movie and really good characters. this is my favorite out of the series, not really scary at all, but VERY entertaining. i think its an interesting way to tackle a zombies-taking-over-the-world movie, a definate classic.
