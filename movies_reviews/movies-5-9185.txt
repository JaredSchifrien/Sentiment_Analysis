A great film. It explores ideas of sexuality and celeberity in a fun and light-hearted way. John Malkovich's capacity for weirdness is used to great puppeteering effect. John Cusak is always great, here as a loser tortured by unequated love. Cameron Diaz is almost unrecognizable, but the sweetness of her character shines through. The ending is brilliant.
