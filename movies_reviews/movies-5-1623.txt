An amazing, dark, disturbing film. Everything is all wrong about this movie - from the rain that doesn't seem to stop, to the uncomfortable pauses in conversation, to the bleary rooms and buildings that the majority of the film takes place in, to the lighting, to the horrifying ending. Incredible acting combined with a dark twisted plot and a very un-Hollywood ending make this one of my favorites in this genre. This movie is worth the price of a rental just to hear Kevin Spacey's chilling monologue towards the end of the movie. A great, creepy flick.
