I can't believe this ordinary piece of crap got critical acclaim and that it received accolades for the writting. And don't tell me that it was so clever that the characters were thinly drawn - that just results in a whole film where every scene is unbelievably dumb - and we're supposed to be seeing humanity - no idea.
