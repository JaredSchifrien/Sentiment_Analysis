The walking dead taking over the town and trying to get at the living and eat them, scary stuff. The whole borded up windows and trying to think of a plan to get out of there situation , by givin options of going into the basement or staying upstairs or just flat out running. I personally would have went in the attic, but hey that is just me. Cool movie it is worth the 5 stars.
