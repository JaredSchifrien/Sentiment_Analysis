I maybe remember seeing bits and pieces of this movie when I was younger. I like Robert Redford don't get me wrong, but to imagine any chemistry between him and Barbara Streisand blows my mind. I keep watching for this to be on AMC sometime but have never been able to catch it. It seems like one of the those movies I guess that have not aged well with time.
