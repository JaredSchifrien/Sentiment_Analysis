Genius screenplay, beautiful cinematography, exquistite acting (particularly Mr. Carrey), phenomenal soundtrack. Everything comes together like a neatly wrapped packaged, although it may seem at some points to go off in several different directions. If you have an imagination, wonder if true love exists, and enjoy seeing moments on screen that have you reminiscent of some of your favorite moments in life, you will also say it's the best you've seen all year.
