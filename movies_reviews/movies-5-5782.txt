WOW, I can't believe I am the only person as of yet to review this film! It is a classic, and one of the best in the film Noir genre. Crawford is stunning in this film of murder and deceit. Going from a housewife baking pies to make money to spoil her ungreatful daughter Veda, to becoming an ambitious owner of a successful chain of restaurants, we see an evolution of a character that is so exciting to watch, the end comes all to soon. Along the way Mildred (Crawford) meets a wonderfully charming man( Monty ), who sells her his place, so that she can open her first restaurant. The two become involved with one another, but we soon see that once her restaurant is a success, he doesnt have a problem taking "tips" from her. Her daughter, who hates anything that smells "of grease" spends her mothers hard earned money with ease, and becomes even more of a nightmare then she was before. She and Monty make fun of Mildred for working for a living, but have no problem spending the earnings. Mildred soon ends her relationship to Monty, but after Veda leaves ( she marries only for a couple of days, to get a 10,000 check on the false grounds that she became pregnant on her wedding night ) Mildred kickes her out, and rightly so. But because Veda is her only surviving daughter, she wants her to come back home. So she marries Monty, who marries her only if she gives him a third of the share in her company. This turns out to be a mistake as he soon sells out, and Mildred is left with the scraps of a company she built with her own two hands. In the end Murder is a result, but who did it? Was it Mildred, her daughter, her first husband? I don't want to spoil the suprise as I have said quite alot about the film already. All I can say is this is one of my favorite movies of all time, and Crawford is at her best in this film. If you enjoyed this one, checkout Crawfords rather less known noir film, "A womans face" which in my opinion is her finest film!
