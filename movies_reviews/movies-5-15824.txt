My comment is in referrence to all those that think people under 17 (maybe 21) shouldn't be allowed to see this. I personally am 16 years old and have watched the movie, NOT for its sexual content. The comment made by atomicsox is degrading to those my age who can think, and are not hormone driven like adults think we are. Kids should be allowed to choose to see that movie. Now if they miss it's deeper and more mind triggering meaning then that is their loss, and they might want to see the movie again when they are more mature. Albeit, those should not be deprived of seeing a psycological and moving film, on account of some ignorance, and controlling (there are other words to supplement there) adults. You should be educating young adults on this matter of life (cause it's not going to go away), not hiding and depriving an opportunity to learn about humans, cause that's what we are.
