It may be shocking at times, but I believe it is people like Michael Moore who keep America thinking. We NEED extreme, shamelessly curious people like Mr. Moore to balance the mega-conservative right-wing in this country. How WONDERFUL it was to see crusaders like Charleton Heston SQUIRMING with discomfort at Moore's in-your-face, can't-get-away questioning. QUESTIONS. That's what's so important about this movie. It makes us THINK. It confronts us with subjects we may often deny thinking about. Moore shows the danger of not examining even the most unpleasant aspects of our American society.
