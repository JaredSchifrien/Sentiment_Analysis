I think this is a very good movie. It has really superb acting by all the main people, and it has a good look to it. But the script takes a few liberties that I disagree with, and there a some flat out mistakes in it. I would still recommend the movie though, because if you haven't seen it as many times as I have (too many to count) you won't notice any of the mistakes, and it is very entertaining. However, I reccommend reading the book, too, because that is the best version of the story.
