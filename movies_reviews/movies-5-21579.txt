I absolutely LOVE LOTR!!!! I know they could have made the movie a lot more like the book, but no one, not even YOU are perfect! This is the best group of book I have ever read and it leaves Harry Potter in the dust by SO far!! Lord Of The Rings is the best movie/book series ever written and I really wish J.R.R would have kept writing them, I know they'd have been more and more amazing each time he wrote a new book.
