I recently added this movie to by dvd collection and can now sleep easy. This is one of my favorite movies OF ALL TIME!! The story is timeless and never gets old. I watch it when I am feeling down and it always picks me up in the end. Billy Crystal is hysterical, and Meg Ryan is beautiful. I like how we get to see them both grow so much through the movie. The soundtrack is to die for as well. I think that men need to give this movie a chance, they may be able to relate to it as well. So can men and women be friends?!?!
