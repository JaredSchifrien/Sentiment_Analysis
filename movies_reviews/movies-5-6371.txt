Great, wonderful, fabulous movie. It's hard to believe that this was Hepburn's first professional role ever, but it was. She won an Oscar for best actress and it was certainly deserved. Greggory Peck was wonderful in his role of the first unsympathetic than the in love reporter. The ending was it had to be. As much as we would love for the handsome Peck and lovely Hepburn to be together, alas, they cannot. She is a princess and he is a lowly reporter, it would just never work. It was very gratifying to see Princess Anne stand up for herself a little after her excursion. Bottom line: great, classic movie with two terrific actors
