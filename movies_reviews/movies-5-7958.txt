This is Bill Murray's best movie. This one is very innvative; offers something new, the guys waking up and reliving the same day over and over again. Not exactly HILARIOUS!!! but it's one of those comedies that's better not b/c it's funny but b/c of the movie in general. It has a nice storyline. And he falls for the foxie Andie MacDowell. Also in it is Chris Elliot who always seems to play the loser.
