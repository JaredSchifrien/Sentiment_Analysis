I love 'heist' movies, and this one did not disapoint. There are so many spoilers, I can barely describe the film, but I'll give it a try: a heist, a plot twist, a con job, a plot twist, Edward Norton gets cold cocked -- twice!, motorboats racing through the canals of Venice, a few GREAT car chases, and a cool, cool ending. It's not in the theaters anymore. Rob your Grandma's purse, if you have to, and go rent this movie! Don't turn off the computer... Go! Now!
