This movie, when compared to Pocahontas is less offensive and does show what American Indians believe in their stories they tell. Truly, the animal characters are cute; and surely a fine movie to watch one who feels sympathy after taking the life away from a momma bear and learning how it is to a bear while taking care of the orphan. Though it did not win an Oscar (Finding Nemo won for best animated film), it is great that it got listed as a nominee. (See Disney's Masterpiece Movies in weblists for a similar comment on this movie.)
