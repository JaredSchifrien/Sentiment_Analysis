A true classic even if the animation looks a little crude now. In the days before I was exposed to anime, the scene on the bomber was the most terrifying piece of animation I had seen. Plus it had a kick ass soundtrack that really captured the essence of music at that time. It annoyed me that the second movie (F.A.K.K. 2 bullshit) was so poor. Part of the strength of the first movie was that it was comprised of vignettes of the most popular and successful stories that had run in the magazine. I was a casual reader of the mag and it seemed pretty clear that this was planned as a movie from the start and lacked the compactness of the first movie.
