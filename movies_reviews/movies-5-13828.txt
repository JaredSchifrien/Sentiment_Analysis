This was the first movie that really took on the emotional experiences of our Vietnam veterens in a realistic way. The before and after scenes made a strong point in how this war affected those people. The difference between this war and other before it was that these veterens were not treated as heroes, and that, in turn, affected how they were able to handle life after the war. I don't think people understood what went on there until they saw this movie.
