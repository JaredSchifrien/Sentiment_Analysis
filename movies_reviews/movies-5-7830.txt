Excellent story and stunning character development. Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Greg Kinnear and Cuba Gooding, Jr star in a story about relationships, love and compassion. At the end of the movie, you realize just how much has changed for the characters and how subtly it happened. Not for action/slapstick fans, but definitely enjoyable.
