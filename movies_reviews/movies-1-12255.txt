Kangaroo Jack is one of those horrible films that is the perfect candidate for the Raspberry Awards. It's horrid to see these two hasbeen actors as a bunch of drunk buddies. It's always nice to see Christopher Walken, but he has no material to work with. The Kangaroo does not talk, with the exception of a long and obnoxious dream sequence which is an excuse to put the move over 80 minutes long.
