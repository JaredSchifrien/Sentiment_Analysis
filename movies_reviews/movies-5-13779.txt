Can I just say this movie was incredible. I didnt even notice the hours going by because it hooked me at the beginning and transported me into the world of Paul Edgecomb and the rest of the guards and the prisoners. The ensemble of great actors is what really made this movie spectacular. David Morse and Doug Hutchison top the list. They were both incredible. Doug played a sniveling little rat to a T. Such a moving powerful story. And so sad. All the actors did their parts so well, you really felt what the characters were feeling. I have watched it again and again. I never tire of it.
