It surpassed my expectations. The CGI was well done as were the fight scenes. The comic book movie genre has been ressurected with the sucess of X-men. So that explains the sudden boom of comic book movies. Ben Affleck gave a surprising performance in this movie and I don't think it's fair to judge a whole movie based solely on one's grudge against Ben Affleck.
