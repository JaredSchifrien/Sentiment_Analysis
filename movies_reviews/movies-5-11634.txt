If you like the subtle absurdities of Rushmore and the Royal Tenenbaums, Bottle Rocket is a must see. This is before the other two, and best captures Andersons style. It had me laughing my arse off. Then again, if you're not a fan of Wes Anderson or the Wilson brothers, you may just find it boring. Definitely worth renting, though.
