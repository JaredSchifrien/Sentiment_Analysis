I'm absolutely shocked to see that Witness for the Prosecution has a composite rating of 3.25! How could anyone give this classic movie anything but five stars? It's highly unusual to find a clever plot, witty dialogue, and exceptional acting all in one movie like this. My husband and I watched it for the first time last night, and we were glued to the screen. There wasn't a dull moment in the entire show. We especially enjoyed watching the hilarious interactions between Sir Wilfred and his nurse. The various twists and turns in the plot kept us guessing 'til the end, which was fun. If you haven't seen this movie, you really should rent it.
