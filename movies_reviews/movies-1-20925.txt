Words cannot describe how awful I thought this movie was. It wasn't the acting, which I thought was good. It was the use of modern music in that era, it just didn't work for me. When Like a Virgin came on, that was it for me. I watched the rest of the movie with everyone else, but that was the point of no return. They could have had a wonderful movie without the stupid use of music that doesn't fit with that era. Maybe I'm just too much of a history buff, I just couldn't stand it.
