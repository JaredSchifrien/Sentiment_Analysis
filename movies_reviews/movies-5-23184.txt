I first watched this movie a few years back because Jim Caviezel was in it. Because I'm an autograph collector, I wrote to him and he sent back a personalized 8x10 not long after. I fell in love with the film because it portrayed the bittersweet relationship between father and son. Jim made a great cop, and Dennis Quaid was a very believable firefighter. This film has an interesting premise and likeable characters.
