Just when you think the psychological horror film has been completely replaced by slash, gash, and trash films along comes a gem like this! The Others devilishly played with my mind and scared me silly at several points and all without exploiting one drop of blood. This tale reached deep into the human psyche and pulled out many of the things we all fear, dread and imagine. I don t think I realized that Nichole Kidman could even act until I saw her in this part but she does a great job as the nervous, high-strung mother of the two strangely afflicted children. As a matter of fact, the entire cast is excellent. The house and grounds also provide a wonderful gothic setting rivaling anything from the golden age of Hollywood (think Rebecca , Wuthering Heights , Jane Eyre ) and the entire film had a very thick atmospheric feeling. The Others is also beautifully shot in what appears to be mostly natural light. Excellent rental for a dark and stormy night!
