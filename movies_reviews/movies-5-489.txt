Easily one of the best movies ever made. Martin Scorsese has a directing style unlike any other and this movie presents both a serious and laid-back look at the Mafia. Ray Liotta delivers quite possibly his best performance as Henry Hill (Remember, this movie is based on a true story). GoodFellas is different from other ganster films such as The Godfather and Scarface, but in a very good way. If you see this movie at the end the only way you will able to sum up what you just saw is: Holy S***!
