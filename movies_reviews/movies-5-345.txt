Brilliant acting. Of course i may be biased, since i'm an aussie, but i thought that Russell Crowe was brilliant in his role. Joaquin Phoenix would have to be the best bad-guy i've ever seen portrayed in a movie - he makes you feel sorry for him and you understand how he feels. The actors with smaller parts were often played by well-renowned and/or brilliant actors. Of course, this film isn't historically correct, but it gives you an unimaginable insight into the grandeur and glory that was Rome. Every detail of this movie was brilliant. From the plot, to the digital effects, to the action and costume. I can't rave enough about this film. See it!!!
