 The absolute best trilogy ever. Forget Star Wars, Evil Dead is a much deeper trilogy. Ok well not really. It does make me laugh though. These films have been focused on those who love B-movies and those who love horror and comedy alike. Army of Darkness is probably one of the best trilogy finales. Bruce Campbell is hilariouse as the good guy with the attitude. Placing him in medievil times makes it even better. More gags than ever and ridiculous as hell. I am an avid fan and highly recommend this horror comedy to anyone with a good since of humor and a love of horror.
