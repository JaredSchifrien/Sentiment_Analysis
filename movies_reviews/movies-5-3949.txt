What a terrific Disney movie. If I were to rate my favorite recent Disney animated full length movie it would be this one.Very well done, good songs, funny and romantic. I saw this at the theater with my kids and enjoyed every bit of it. the characters were fun to watch.The talking clocks, and other objects. I loved it when Belle and the Beast found they cared for one another.This movie has some of the best songs. Be Our Guest and the rest. No wonder they turned this into a broadway play.
