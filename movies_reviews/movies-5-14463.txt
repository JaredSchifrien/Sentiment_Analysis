I have probably seen this movie easily 50 times as I would consider it my favorite movie of all time. I would agree with an earlier comment that it does leave you with a rather empty feeling, as it has a bittersweet ending, but I think with a title like Almost Famous I didn't view the movie expecting to see the feel-good movie of the year. I thought it was real, and a very deep look at human nature and emotions, and is not just a movie about what life was like for rock stars in the 70's, but for all people in any time period. I thought Kate Hudson was amazing. She was the perfect actress for this movie. The rest of the cast was absolutly perfect as well. There was just enough humour, executed perfectly, to make Almost Famous fairly light hearted without taking away from the drama. The soundtrack is fantastic as well, I just paused through the credits and wrote down every song, as they are all fantastic, and the actual soundtrack should have been about 4 disks, 1 doesn't do it justice.
