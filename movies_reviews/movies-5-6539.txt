This is a real masterpiece. Not only one of the best movies about judgments in the History but one of the best I ve ever seen. Incredible group of characters performed by actors like James Stewart, Ben Gazzara or the beautiful Lee Remick. Preminger doesn t need to show you the characters more than a minute for you to know them well. That s classic cinema. Fine camera movements, great use of the time (not the videoclips we are used to see these days) and a marvellous script that doesn t use the flashbacks in order not to give you subjective information, you only know what happened thanks to what characters say. You can believe it or not. That s intelligent. Because at the end, you can only still supposse what happened!. If you haven t seen it, go and look for it!, I promise you won t regret.
