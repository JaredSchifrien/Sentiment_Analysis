Out of all of the choices for classic movies on this site, Some Like It Hot, should be #1. It was rated the funniest movie ever made every single time at the AFI awards, and it deserves full credit. It's an extremly funny movie, and Marilyn Monroe does an excellent job. It introduces us to nice, crude humor and putting men in drag can be funny, it teaches us throughout the movie. It has great make up effects, and is pretty high budget for it's time, and it seems like none of the humor is outdated.
