Feeling a bit bored today, so watched my vid of Pretty Woman. My Dad sat all the way through it and pulled it apart, saying it was obvious and the plot was too full of clues. Okay, I said to him, maybe it is. But thats exactly what I wanted. I didn't want to have to think, I didn't want to wonder how it was going to turn out. I wanted to watch a film where both characters are likeable, boy meets girl, and you remember (if only for a second, before you realise its just a film) that fairy tales do come true.
