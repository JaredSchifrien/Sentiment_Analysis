I never got a chance to see this in the movie theater, however I rented it and I was simply baffled at how such a great commentary could have received such bad reviews. I have to give it 4 stars for the message it sends, and then add the extra star for the quality film-making. It is a very depressing movie, I must say. If you are looking for a comedy or a happy, fun movie, this isn't what you want. Not to say that those types of movies are bad, but this great film conveys an important message. John Q exposes the flaws and immoral, unethical practice that occurs in hospital emergency rooms everyday. If you're poor and can't afford a high-magnitude procedure, too bad. There are a couple brilliant scenes in the movie that are priceless in their depiction of the exact sentiment that I'm sure most of the audience had. If you were scared away by the bad reviews or just didn't get a chance to see it, I urge that you watch it and come to a realization about a great ill in America's health insurance system.
