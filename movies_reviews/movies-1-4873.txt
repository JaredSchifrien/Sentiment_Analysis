Quite simply, I hated this movie. Dustin Hoffman's scenery-chewing Captain Hook was annoying, and Robin Williams gets unintentional laughs as Peter Pan, running around in that ridiculous outfit. The lost boys are a bunch of little brats and heathens who need their behinds thrashed, and even Julia Roberts' usual charm wore thin as Tinkerbell. This is definitely one of Steven Spielberg's lesser efforts.
