The first and, I think, the best of the tricolors trilogy by polish writer/director Krzysztof Kieslowski. The most emotional of the three, with a tremendous score. Juliet Binoche is haunting and beautiful as ever; her reserve and somewhat cold beauty suit Kieslowski's themes of pain and liberty very well.
