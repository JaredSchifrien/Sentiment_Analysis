I LOVE THIS MOVIE. It's so beautiful. This made me think that maybe there really is something beyond human about Ali. Like how they had been waiting for the wet season so long - then as soon as Ali knocked out Foreman, lightning struck and the monsoon started. That gave me goose bumps. Ali is a God. Great film. Great man. And to all the rednecks, racist, and right wingers in general, coward is the last thing he was. Not fighting a pointless war for a f&cking crook makes you a hero, not a coward. The film was very well made though. And the story is better than fiction.
