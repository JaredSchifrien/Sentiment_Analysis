If one of your favorite directors is Martin Scorsese and you think that Robert De niro and Harvey Keitel are two of the best living actors, why haven t you seen this movie?. In my opinion this is a masterpiece, even better than Raging bull , Taxidriver or Goodfellas (wich I really love). Characters like few times I ve seen and the extremely complex personality of the director makes this one an amazing experience.
