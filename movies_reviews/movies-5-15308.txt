Finding Forrester is one of the best movies I've seen not only in the past 2 or 3 years, but of my life. The main character is an urban kid and is really a genius. He's sent to a prestigious prep school and everyone doesn't think he's academically sound, yet he really is a genius. Everyone thinks the school took him for his equally amazing basketball ability. The friendship he forms with the intellectual writer William Forrester makes the movie a bit of a bildungsroman. I would emphatically recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it. It is a classic in my opinion.
