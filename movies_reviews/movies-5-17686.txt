Hugo Weaving as a blind man who distrusts the world, Genevieve Picot as his housekeeper who loves him yet torments him incessantly, and a sweet Russell Crowe as the innocent who brings honesty and revelation into their lives. Fascinating characters and a subtle plotline. One of my all time favorites, foreign or domestic.
