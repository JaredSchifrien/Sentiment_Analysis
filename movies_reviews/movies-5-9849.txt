So good that I wouldn't dare try to quantify it. However, one thought that occurred to me was that all of the main characters in the story - the boy, Bill Murray, the woman - even the womans dead husband were all the same character, the same mind but in different bodies at different ages. To me it explained all of their attractions to each other.
