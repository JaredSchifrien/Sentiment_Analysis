I agree with glorybox. This film definitely exceeded my expectations, because I wasn't quite as impressed with the first one as most people were. But then, this time around, it seems I was more impressed than a few people. But I was certainly laughing out loud, and I was much more entertained since there were a lot of unexpected turns. One of the best comedies I've seen in a good while. Oh yeah, and I love Zhang Ziyi, too. In my opinion, no girl can pull off no-nonsense (yet still likeable) toughness like she can.
