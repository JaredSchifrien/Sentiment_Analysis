Rosemary's Baby has to be the scariest movie of all time. There's no blood or gore, just the pure psychological terror that builds within the mind of the main character Rosemary Woodhouse, as she uncovers a plot to have her unborn child stolen by a group of devil worshippers. This is one horror movie that breaks away from the Freddy Kruger/Michael Myers/Texas Chainsaw Massacre mould and is a classic in its own right. Try not to expect too much in regards to flying limbs and heads being chopped off and I guarantee you won't be disappointed!
