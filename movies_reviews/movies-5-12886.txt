Superb well crafted film about an innocent man Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) who is convicted of murdering his wife and the changes he goes through while in prison. Standout peformances by Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore and Bob Gunton as the cruel warden. The movie has rightly become a modern movie classic.
