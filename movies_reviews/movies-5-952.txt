A well done movie.i remember hearing that the reason why we did not see the shark a lot was because they could not get it to work. when filming. It turned out good thing. I think the anticipation of the shark coming could keep me in suspense.The actors are all good. the here comes the shark music' was great.The only bad part was I saw this movie in a huge theater for the first time. and television does not give the movie the same effect. A good movie though.
