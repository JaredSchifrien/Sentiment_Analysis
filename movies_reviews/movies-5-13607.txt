Wow! I had enormous expectations still it was better than I thought it would be! This is the most dramatic movie I've ever seen, one of the most ironic! This is theatre on film! Hopefully it will create a new aera where theatre people start making films! Sam Mendes MAY become the greatest of all directors in the movie history - at least his first film is absolutely terrific! More than anything else, it's the script that overwhelmed me! I expected a deep movie, while it's in fact as entertaining as Todo sobre mi madre. I totally disagree that the characters in this movie is cartoon-like. Again I would compare it to the much more cartoony Todo sobre mi madre. Great acting of course. And fasten your seatbelts: The ending is like taken out of an Agatha Christie novel! Even better than The Sixth Sense' ending! The film teqniques is better than The Matrix, Fight Club Todo sobre mi madre added together! A little better than American Pie, which I think is the second best movie of the year! Hope it'll get tons of Oscars! The only thing I didn't like with this film was actually the trailer, hehehe! It didn't tell me much, but maybe that was only positive. It made my cinematic experience even more overwhelming! I think it's the 5. best movie I've seen to date, after Forrest Gump, Gandhi, La vita bella Dogme 1 - Festen! :-D
