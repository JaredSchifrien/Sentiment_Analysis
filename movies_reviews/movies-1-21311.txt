Rightfully reguarded as one of the worst movies ever made. Not in the way that PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE is, just so bad, it is actually fun to watch, but in a way that is actually painfull to watch. Disappointing from the opening credits to the closing credits. I can't believe George Burns, who is usually a rather good comic, would have agreed to appear in this peice of trash. If you are a Beatles fan, despite the title, I urge you to skip this movie. I have not had any respect for Peter Frampton since seeing this dreck. It is hard to take him seriously anymore. The only redeaming quality about this abomanation is the beauty of the actress who played Strawberry Fields, even though she couldn't act her way out of a plastic bag. When I first heard about this movie I was very excited, being a huge fan of the Beatles. The cast sounds like it can't miss. But, someone, in the opening two minutes, I knew this film would be bad. I can't believe just how bad it was. As a comparison, this movie makes SHOWGIRLS seem like an Oscar winner. And SHOWGIRLS is one of biggest disappoints in movie history. Whenever SGT. PEPPER is scheduled to be shown on tv (which is rare, thank god!!!!!), I turn off my televison, lest I catch just a glimpse of this travesty. There are not enough words in the English language, or any other, to describe my hatered for this god-awful piece of crap.
