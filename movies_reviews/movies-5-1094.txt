If one film could incapsulate the self-indulgence of the eighties onto a single piece of celluloid, it would be this one. Al Pacino plays arguably the greatest role of his prestigious career in his performance of Tony Montana, an ironic personification of the American dream. Tony is a lowly career criminal who comes to America from Communist Cuba with little more than the shirt on his back and a gleam in his eye. Fueled by his newly liberated sense of desire, he goes from rags to riches (dealing in yayo, naturally). In doing so though, he becomes lax, decadent and obsessed with money. This action packed tale is a vividly painted portrait of the double-edged sword that is desire. The plentiful action scenes are inventive and Pacino lends a infectious intensity to them. Oh yes, it's funny too. Pacino's portrayal of the exaggeratedly crude Montana is side-splitting as he spouts language that would make Howard Stern wince. Scarface is the complete package, a true epic and every minute is infused with vibrant creativity.
