A movie that should have inspired the drdge in Washington to actually make an island prison to save us all from repeat offenders. Alas, they could not get the picture. Oh well, the movie was great anyway! Kurt Russell proved he was more than the kid from the Disney movies in this picture. Donald Pleasance (the professor from Halloween) as the pres was good. I got a real kick out of Russell's character. Dark and comic at the same time. Rent it, own it, love it.
