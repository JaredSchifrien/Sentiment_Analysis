Awesome! Has script and dialog so well executed, that children and adults will view the same scene and burst out laughing for totally different reasons. The song scene with the Disneyish Blue Bird still kills me! The film is clever, message driven and can be enjoyed on many different levels. Hum! Maybe like an onion ! Just go and ENJOY!
