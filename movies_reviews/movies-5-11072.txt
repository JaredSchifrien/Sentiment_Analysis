Warning: Not for young audiences; may be offensive to some due to content. Anyway: This movie is about a young girl named Mary and her senior year in her Christian high school. She loves her life, has the perfect Christian friends, and a perfect Christian boyfriend . . . at least she thinks so, until he tells her: I think I'm gay. Ouch. She goes through drastic measures to try to save him, and suddenly she realizes how imperfect her perfect Christian life really is. This movie does go into a lot of issues which may be considered offensive, but it passes very strong messages about tolerance, understanding and true friendship. Extremely funny.
