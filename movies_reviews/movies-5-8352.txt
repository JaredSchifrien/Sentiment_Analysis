The movie that made Tom Hanks Big and he was perfect for the role because he could bring out the child like innocence of the adult. The boy looked like a young Tom Hanks. There are some great memorable scenes such as the dancing on the giant keyboards at FAO Schwarz with Robert Loggia, the way he eats the baby corn appetizers and when he invites Elizabeth Perkins into his loft and tells her that he gets to be on top. A delightful film.
