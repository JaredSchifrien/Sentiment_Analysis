The Dead Poets Society, in my opinion, is one of the best movies ever made and slightly underrated. Beneath the pure entertainment value of its interesting story and incredibly brilliant performance by Robin Williams, this film tells much about the soul's desire in choice of vocation versus just trying to do what's expected of us by authority figures such as parents and heads of prestigious schools. On another level I think it encourages the passion of books, poetry and reading. Besides Williams, all the other roles in the film were also well acted, and the students all seemed very real.
