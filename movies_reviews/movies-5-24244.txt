Of all the movies based on comics that have been released, Fantastic Four is probably one truest to the comics and cartoons than any of the others. Already a great comic book series, Fantastic Four is fantastically realized as a theatrical feature. The plot centers around one of the main foes of the FF, Dr. Doom. After gaining their powers, they must face him down as he blames them for his own transformation. The continunity touches are great and include references to Doom's home country, the conflict between The Human Torch and The Thing and more. The acting is very good--especially the actors that portray The Thing and The Human Torch. Jessica Alba is also quite good--and extremely attractive--as the Invisible Girl. The special effects are amazing and the fast pace of the movie never slows down. There are also well-executed elements of humor, and a moment involving an action figure that nearly breaks the fourth wall. Overall, a very fun ride and a good movie.
