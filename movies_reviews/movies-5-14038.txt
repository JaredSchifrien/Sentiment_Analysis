although i rate this as a great movie, i could never figure out why saleri hated mozart so much...time and again, the 'reason' is shown in the film, but saleri, although jealous, idolized mozart. a scene in particular is when mozarts wife, constanze, takes originals to saleri for his 'approval' to bring mozart into the royal court, as they are becoming penniless...he says the music is 'miracleous', but drops the originals on the floor and steps upon them as he walks out, refusing to give mozart any sort of consideration, although throughout the entire movie, he constantly claims devotion to him...anyway, a great movie!
