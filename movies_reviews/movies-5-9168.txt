This was by far one of the best movies ever made. Spike Jonze is one of the smartest men alive to take on this movie. Number one... John Malkovich is one of the best actors of our time how crazy is it to have the idea to go inside his head. Number two... how crazy is it that they had john cusack (a regular guy off the street) as a puppet master. One Word ORIGINALITY. I could go on about how good this movie is for a day but there is not enough space for me to write how much i love this movie. This is a garunteed classic. This movie fits into every category by at least one scene or another. A must see
