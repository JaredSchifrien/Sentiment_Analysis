The movie was incredible, peter jackson did a amazing job.My favourite characters in the movie had to be the hobbits (their so cute and funny!) and also legolas. Peter made me feel as though i was in middle earth, which happens to be where i live! (wellington, new zealand) i can't wait to see the next trilogy in this series, all the actors put up an amazing preformance, esspecially elijah wood! well done peter......a definite 10 out of 10 for that movie!
