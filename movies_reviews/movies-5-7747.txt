This satire about nuclear war is Stanley Kubrick's best film. It was made in 1964, before he went crazy and made A Clockwork Orange in 1971. Peter Seller's performance is what makes this movie, and George C. Scott is pretty good too. Not only is it Kubick's best film, it is also, in my opinion, the best film of the sixties, and the best comedy ever.
