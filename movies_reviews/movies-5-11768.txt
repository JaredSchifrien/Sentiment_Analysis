Trey and Matt have struck gold once again. Now don't go into this one expecting Shakespeare or clean, wholesome, or otherwise safe family entertainment (yeah, you know who you are). Never in my life have I laughed so hard in a theatre, nor have I ever been to a movie that got such an overwhelming reaction of chestpain-inducing laughter from everyone in attendance. The audience reaction was so overwhelming that it was at difficult to hear the dialogue at times. Parker and Stone are right on the money in their criticisms of all sides of the war on terror: everything, from kneejerk patriotism to Hollywood's delusions that they can change the world with their acting and how the rest of the world gets caught in the crossfire. Their representation of Sean Penn's Iraq visit reminiscence is spot on. Just like South Park, this work is far more intelligent than meets the eye. Parker and Stone have further perfected their formula of taking a relatively serious issue, hitting it with a dash of clever political commentary, and then giving it a generous ladling of tacky sauce. It works every time. The peons who can't see past the bathroom humor and get to the meat of what these guys are trying to say should go back to their American Idols, their Bachelors, and their Apprentices.
