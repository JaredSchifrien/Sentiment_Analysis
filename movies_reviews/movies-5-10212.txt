OK folks, it's not going to win an OSCAR and it's not going to be shown at the Cannes Film Festival, but it is a great movie. Piper Perabo, who played the lead character Violet has that Aww shucks sexy girl next door look that you would either want for your daughter or girlfriend. The music was great and I personally like LeAnn Rimes who plays herself in this movie and does the actual singing. I like movies for their entertainment value. I want to sit down, relax and be entertained and this movie does that for me.
