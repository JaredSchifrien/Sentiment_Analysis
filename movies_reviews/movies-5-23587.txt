This is the best film adaptation of King Arthur, and the cinematography is superb. John Boorman directed this wonderful movie and it brings the audience in to the mystical era. The story is tragic and has its moments of folly. There are great lessons to be learned here and the story envelopes us all. Seal the letter and let it flow.
