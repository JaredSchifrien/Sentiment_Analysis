Excellent Movie! Brilliant acting by Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta. A typical Tarintino film - if you liked his other films, you'll love this. Jules (Jackson) and Vincent (Travolta) are basically two hitmen. But they seem to consider their jobs as quite ordinary (as their witty conversations on their way to kill people would suggest). Now, they have to kill a boxer, Butch (Bruce Willis) for doing something he shouldn't have to their boss - Marcellus Wallace. There are interesting things that happen along the way. Vincent takes out Marcllus' wife Mia (Uma Thurman), Vincent accidently shoots someone, Jules and Vincent get caught in a robbery and Jules thinks that God rescued him and Vincent from bullets shot at them . . . . . just to name a few!!!!
