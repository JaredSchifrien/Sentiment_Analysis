now this is funny. when i 1st saw it i was laughin a whole lot. the series has always managed to make me laugh. i showed this movie to an old friend of mine and i don't see why but it really bothered her. and the ring didn't bother her. i wonder what they were thinkin when they had the tree branch rape scene. another classic moment we will all remember.
