Excellent depiction of the holocaust. Shot entirely in Black and White with a few small enhancements, Steven Spielberg should see this as one of his best works. I was touched, and was brought to tears in this movie. No one can truly understand the horror, but this film gives one the idea, and shows the best and worst parts of humanity simultaneously.
