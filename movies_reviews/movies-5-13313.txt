Saving Private Ryan was a good drama. I loved the way it made me feel like I was right in the trenches with them. The actors did a good job of making me feel their emotions. I think I really know what war was like because of that movie. This was one of the best movies I have seen. This was a very touching, very realistic movie. The reason I like it so much is because it is so realistic.
