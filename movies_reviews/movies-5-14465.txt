One of my favorite films, this is based on the life of director Cameron Crowe during his days as a teenaged journalist for Rolling Stone. Patrick Fugit plays the main character with fresh-faced youth and vulnerability. His journey to adulthood as he travels with a rock band is compelling and wildly entertaining. Kate Hudson plays the groupie with a heart charmingly and the rest of the cast is terrific. A huge plus of this film is its wonderful soundtrack filled with great, classic rock. I just can't stop raving about this movie.
