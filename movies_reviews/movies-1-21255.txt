This is the South Pacific for the TV verion I was subjected to last week, not the Rodgers and Hammerstein original. First of all, badly acted, so why not thow in a bunch of swear words, THAT will make it good. 50 something Nellie? Oh God. Throw in that HORRIBLE Blood Mary... lots of sex, oh thanks guys. Typical America. The girls who holds out get the guy and the girl who gives it up sits on the side of the road selling junk nobody wants. Thanks for that dose of reality. Thankfully sleep claimed me an hour and 45 minutes into the show or I may have had to look at that aweful selection for Joe Cable. Hmm., Ameil was OK. The only cute about the entire movie was the two little kids. If Hollywood or whoever claims this remake can't think of new scripts they better get out there and find new writers.
