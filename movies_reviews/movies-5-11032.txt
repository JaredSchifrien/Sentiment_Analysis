If you go in viewing this movie as what it is, a harmless, happy cinderella story, then you will find that you enjoy it a great deal. I fell in love with Anne Hathaway after seeing this movie. Anyone who doesn't see a more than a few smiles in this movie has forgotten the joys that accompany innocence.
