Bearing in mind this was supposed to be a family movie, I thought it was rather good. There were definetly spots that could have used some pepping up, but overall I quite enjoyed it. The story is predictable, but then, what kids movie isn't? I thought Robin Williams schtick (as people keep calling it) livened things up quite a bit, myself. Highly recommended, though you may want to rent it.
