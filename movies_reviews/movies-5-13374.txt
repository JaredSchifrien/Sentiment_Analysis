It is not just a movie, it is a philosophy, forgotten easily in this crazy world of ours. It is a drama about a simple man, who is ready to sail with the wind, with full gusto, just like the feather in the opening/closing musical suite. His life, the way he 'simply' goes through the turbulent times around, as well as his 'Run', and the feather,..they are ALL SYMBOLIC. Nobody expects real life to be like that, but it is a beautifully crafted DRAMA (critics are U listening) that forces U to ponder upon another way of looking at things! Great acting, wit, direction and music (perhaps the best cross sectional selection of greatest American classics).
