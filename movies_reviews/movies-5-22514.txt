I recently watched this film on the Sci-Fi channel; it had been a few years since I last watched it. One can determine how good a movie is by how well it ages. This movie ages extremely well, in the same class as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Forbidden Planet. Its special effects and premise are still believable. This movie is definitely a sci-fi classic.
