This movie is easily one of the most incredible movies of all-time. Perhaps the best of all Star Trek movies, First Contact brings back the feared enemy introduced in Q, Who? and Best of Both Worlds, The Borg! Instantly, a new Enterprise is revealed and the Soverign-class is an incredible design. The battle scene towards the beginning (which introduces the Akira, Norway, and Steamrunner class vessels!) is absoultely amazing as well. The plot is classic Trek--the evil Borg have traveled back in time to assimilate humanity before the founding of the Federation and our heroes must stop them. The action is taut throughout and well balanced with clever bits of comedy and even a moment that comes close to breaking the fourth wall (So, your all astronauts on...on some kind of Star Trek?) The Roddenberry humanism is present as well, with references to humanity conquering poverty, war, and strife, in addition to evolving beyond money. Not slowing down a bit, the movie rushes to a great finish. The musical score (including the classic Star Trek: TNG theme) is consistently enjoyable throughout as well.
