Very touching movie with two old veterans, Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn. They are both hilarious and heartwarming as the aging couple who are spending another summer in their lake home. The relationship they have, as well as their relationships with their daughter, her fiance, and her soon to be stepson who gets stuck there with them, are all right on target and it all rings true. You can't help but laugh at Henry Fonda, even though he's spouting obscenities half the time.
