Silence of the Lambs might have scared the crap out of me, but I find it to be a psychological thriller, not a horror movie. This is probably Jodie Foster's best role and it is a shame she refused to do the sequel. Silence of the Lambs takes you into the world of a psychopath like no other movie. Manhunter is an excellent prequel to the movie.
