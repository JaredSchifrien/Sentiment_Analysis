This quietly observant tale of an elderly Japanese couple who visit their(adult)children in Tokyo,but find only their widowed daughter-in-law makes them welcome,is among the most humane,wise and poignant films ever made,rightly considered a true masterpiece of world cinema.(voted 3rd best film in the Sight and Sound international poll,1992).It also happens to be my wife's personal favourite.
