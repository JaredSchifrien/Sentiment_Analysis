This movie is excellent. The graphics are improved over the original (except for the humans, they are still too reflective). The story line is interesting for kids and adults, taking lines from many of our favorite classics . While I thought the adult humour was a little much for a child-oriented movie, the Barbie dance scene and Buzz Lightyear's reaction to Jesse had me rolling in the aisle with laughter. I highly recommend the film.
