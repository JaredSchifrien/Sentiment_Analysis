This was an outstanding movie! Angelina Jolie's performance was indescribable! This was a true story about an 18 year old girl, Susanna Kaysen (played by Winona Ryder), who was accused of being insane and put into a mental institute. She meets many girls with problems far worse than hers, for example, Lisa (Angelina Jolie). There is no movie better than this one, and I can say that with honest truth. If you've read the book the movie might ruin some assumptions you made during your reading, or clear up some fuzzy areas. It's my favorite movie ever!
