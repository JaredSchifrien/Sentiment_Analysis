Definitely the best of the trilogy and one of the best action movies of all-time. One of the things that made it so great was that Indy was just a seemingly average guy. He didn't have any special powers. In addition, the movie didn't have any wild special effects and was more believable than most action movies (with the exception, of course, of the climactic scene). If you've never seen this film, what are you waiting for. It is Harrison Ford at his best.
