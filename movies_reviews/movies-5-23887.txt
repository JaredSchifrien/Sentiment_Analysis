In my opinion, Gattaca is the best movie made out of the whole decade of the 90's. It has such an original script, and Andrew Nichol is now at the top of my favorite Directors list, and I base that on this movie alone. There are very few movies that I can say are perfect, but this is one of them. Anyone who hasn't seen it should go rent it immediately.
