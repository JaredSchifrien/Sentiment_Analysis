A great family movie with an excelent twist, how do you find a treasure when you first have to find a map? My dad even got into this one on account of it made mention of his group the Masons (I think I can mention that he is one since they don't seem to be quite as secretive as they once were), and he does not watch too many Disney movies anymore. The film contained so much obviously well researched historical information and was so well acted that I actually started wondering if the treasure was real.
