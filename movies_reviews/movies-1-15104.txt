Absolute WORST 2bux I wasted in a looong looooong time.....this is one god AWFUL movie with nothing redeeming in it whatsoever..Michael D is a wasted talent here in this poorly written downer of a film. I wonder if there was actually a director on the set of this TURKEY, there is simply no emotion captured whatsover. NO chemistry between ANY of the cast/characters....very boring to a lame space music score which only amplifies the lack of a original story...not a single credible character to care about...RIDICULOUS scene where Michael D (the Dad) meets up with his daughters negro junkie dealer and does NOTHING about it !! pretty DUMB when he's the head of the top federal DEA type agency with dozens of agents at his disposal. The entire plot borders on the improbable....9 count em seconds of screen time for SALMA HAYAK?? wished they would have given her a couple of actual lines to say...the junkie teenage daugher miscast she isn't very pretty or believable....whoever wrote this TERRIBLE screenplay needs to have their WGA membership taken away !! again the WORST MOST BORING DOWNER MOVIE I can remember (but would LOVE to forget) in the past 5 years easily. -----Todd Michael Wiseman -----Ohio Univ College of Cinematography Film
