I loved it! I'm a JP junkie. : ) Great effects and beautiful music. The plot was great, too, but it's far from matching up to the first JP. Beats the second by a mile, though. Long live Jurassic Park!!! Oh, and #4 is SUPPOSEDLY going to come out Summer, 2006, but they've been rescheduling the theatre realease date for some time. Bad news for those who hated the second JP: #4 is supposed to be about the dinos rampaging through North America. Let's hope they do a better job!
