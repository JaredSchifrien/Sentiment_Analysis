Without a doubt the biggest piece of junk to come out of Hollywood so far this year. Complete garbage all the way. Will Ferrel's horrendous acting never ceases to amaze me, he just gets worse and worse every movie he comes out with, and this movie is no different than all the other trash he has accomplished thus far. The storyline was loosely based on women's rights in television news. Christina Applegate barely tried in this movie, but I can understand why. (I wouldn't do very good acting next to Will Ferrel either.) She must have owed someone a favor, otherwise I would never be able to understand why she would even be willing to star in such a piece of junk. Do not waste your time or money...it is really awful...
