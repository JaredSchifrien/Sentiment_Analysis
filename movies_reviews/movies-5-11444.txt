Say what you want, but Jon Heder's 'Napoleon Dynamite' is very funny. What makes this movie so successful isn't so much the interaction of the seemingly cartoonish characters, but more the fact that the perennial underdogs ought to prevail despite the circumstances that should to overwhelm them. And it doesn't hurt that the picture is spliced with unforgettable supporting characters like Uncle Rico and Pedro, who feed about the humor throughout the film. All these make for a hilarious comedy which will bring loads of laughs to all movie-goers.
