 You either get busy living, or you get busy dying. This is a tightly crafted movie you have to see twice to fully appreciate; things you learn at the end of the first viewing change the way you interpret the events from earlier in the movie. The only flaw IMHO is Stephen King's stilted views of prison guards (too cruel) and prisoners (many too sheepish).
