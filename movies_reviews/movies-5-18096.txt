One of the best suspense movies out there. I love the atmosphere of this film. And Kathy Bates, Kathy Bates and Kathy Bates. Amazing. Very good suspense/horror - one of my favorites. Reat the book too (by Stephen King), it's also good, although I prefer the film's ending rather than the book's. Kathy Bates rules.
