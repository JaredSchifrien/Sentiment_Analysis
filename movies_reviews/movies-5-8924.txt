I found this movie hysterical on many levels. I loved the beginning, which pokes fun at the Star Trek people. (If you've read any of the biographies, you'll know that that's pretty much how Shatner was, afterword) Guy makes this movie work, being the figurative red-shirts from the Star Trek: Original series. You know them, their lines went something like, Captain, I think I've found something. AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!! Red was NOT a good color on that show.
