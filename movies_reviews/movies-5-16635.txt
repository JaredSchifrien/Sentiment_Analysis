Simply the best movie I have seen in years. So incredibly real! So beautifully understated. It's rare that you see a movie where you actually beleive every single event happening - and word spoken on the screen - it's real life translated. Mark Ruffalo and Laura Linney are both devastatingly good! Bravo!!!
