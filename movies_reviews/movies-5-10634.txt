Putney Swope is an outrageously funny comedy about race relations in an imaginery Madison Avenue Ad agency in the late 1960's. Without a doubt, it is the funniest movie ever made and, because of the way it pokes fun at minorities, it will never be shown on television. You'll laugh so hard you'll wet your pants!
