This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I approached it with caution, because it looked like the cheesiest flick ever, but turned out to be the best film i had seen all year! The characters are all vibrant and hilarious, and the actors do an excellent job! Pretty faces all round (I instantly fell in love with Kevin!) and with some absolutely hilarious scenes (the apple pie scene and band camp stories are pure genius!) this film really is worth watching over and over again. Make sure you see the uncut version...or you really are missing out!
