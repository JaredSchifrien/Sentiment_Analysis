W P Kinsella is an American treasure and this movie may actually be as good as his book (titled Shoeless Joe). Costner and the always-excellent James Earl Jones shine like angels. If you like baseball movies, and I love them, this is a great film. If you don't like baseball moves, but like films about characters who persevere and follow their dreams, this is still a great film.
