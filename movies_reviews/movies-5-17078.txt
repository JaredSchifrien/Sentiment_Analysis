I've gotta admit I thought this film was good, not the story, just the way it was filmed - the style. I didn't know people could make films like this anymore and only stanley kubrck could have made a film like this in 1999! Another strange fact: It's filmed completely in England though set In New York, the only shots of the real city were filmed via a second unit!
