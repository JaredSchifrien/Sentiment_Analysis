The characters/actors are what make this movie great. It's a bit dark and violent, so I would not recommended to everyone. Jerry Lundegaard has some financial problems so he hires some people to kidnap his wife and they would demand a ransom from her rich father. Things take a turn for the worse when they end up killing Jerry's wife and the pregnant police chief is hot on the trail. William H Macy is excellent as Lundegaard. Francis McDormand is funny and refreshing as the police chief. Steve Buscemi is superb as the violent psychopath. The movie is fresh, funny, violent, and thrilling. Quite possiblly The Coen Brothers best film.
