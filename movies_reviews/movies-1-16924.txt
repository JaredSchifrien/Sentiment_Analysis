After many Succesful modern day Shakespeare adpatations 10 Things I hate About You (The Taming of the Shrew), Romeo and Juliet (the 1996 version), Hamlet (the 2000 version) they decided to grace our screens with this dribble. I thought that it was far too ambitious using a High School as a back-drop. Mekhi Pfieffer for me was too brutal to play Othello, Josh Hartnett made a good Iago, Julia Stiles a very moderate Desdemona, the only exception was Rain Phoenix who was excellent as Amelia. No thanks I won't be watching this again.
