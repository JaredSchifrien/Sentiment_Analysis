A film of enormous scope, breath-taking beauty and thought-provoking drama, The Searchers is THE movie for many people. Its influence is seen all over the films of such great directors as Spielberg, Lucas, Scorsese and Coppola. John Ford made many great films, but The Searchers is the one for which he will be remembered.
