this movies timing was perfect i was in my early teen years and able to understand the somwhat deeper themes of the film. (redemption, forgivness,family) after empire this would be number two for me. to sum it up i guess there are three things that are most memorable to me about jedi: 1. the lapti nek song from jabba's band(still prefer it over the sp.ed music) 2.carrie fisher(still have a crush on her to this day.)3.the scene where the jedi anakin returns and saves his son and his own life. on of the few scenes in movies that can choke me up even today.
