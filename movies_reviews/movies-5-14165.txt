It is hard to rate this movie. There are so many disturbing things about 'Boys Don't Cry' that it makes it hard to say it is Great! On the other hand, it is done so well, as disturbing as it is, I have no choice but to rate it a 5. The story about a girl who is really a boy inside (but born with girl parts) goes to a new town, as a boy and discovers love with a young girl. The acting is amazing. I forgot that she was a he. The movie was put together in all aspects. The director did a great job.
