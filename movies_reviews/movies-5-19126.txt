love this film not really a vampire movie but an action movie with vampires in it. awsome opening in the nightclub that firmly estabishes blade as a kick butt take no prisoners type of character very close to the comics. great use of music and fight scenes something that mortal kombat tried yet failed to do. also loved steven dorff as decon frost blade's vampire fahter he is perfect in his performance(cool dresser) even cooler sense of meance and don't give a crap attiude. only kiefer sutherland played a cooler bad vampire.
