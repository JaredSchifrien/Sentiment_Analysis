Pearl Harbor is a wonderfuly diveloped movie. It isn't very historicly correct. True the raid was kind of historicly correct. But everything else wasn't. I must say it is very nice - computer animation wise. There was lots of gore and the arizona sceens looked very real. I totaly reccommend watching the movie.
