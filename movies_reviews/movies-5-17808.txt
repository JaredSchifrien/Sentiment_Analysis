This movie is a classic. To this day, it has the ability to creep me out beyond belief, and I've seen it about 20 times. It proves that Stanley Kubrick could not have made a boring, ineffective movie if he tried. In any other director's hands (i.e. whoever directed that horrible made for TV remake in 1997), this could have been unintentionally hilarious. Especially with Jack Nicholson's kid-gloves-are-off performance. But Kubrick creates such a menacing atmosphere with his visuals, music and other sound effects (like heart beats) that the movie becomes something to haunt your dreams (and it will). The Overlook Hotel--number one on the list of classic horror film settings. A frightening and occasionally surreal experience through and through.
