Star Wars is the pioneer of the special effects movies. The difference of SW and many of todays 'special effects' showcases is that it had an excellent SF storyline which made for the excellent sequels. It is an adventure that gets better with repeatedly viewing. Although the special effects in this movie appear contrived compared to today's, one has to look very closely to notice the mistakes. This is the prime reason George Lucas later re-made the original into what it should have been the first time. An excellently cast movie, good direction, good story: Darth Vader is the absolute personification of the arch villain. A classic story of good versus evil.
