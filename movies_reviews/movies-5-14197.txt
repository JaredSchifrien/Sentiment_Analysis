Now this was a very well-done historical film; Kate Blanchett's steely white face without a doubt will flicker before my eyes everytime I read British history. Both accurate and intriguing, history came to life in all its costumes and turning an otherwise dull chapter of monarchy into a magnificent saga of sacrificial triumph. Elizabeth the Queen feminist-whoever would have thought.
