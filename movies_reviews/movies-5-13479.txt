There should be more movies like this one-a simple, compelling story that you will remember always. What drew me into this story is that it reminds me of childhood adventures. Although I am a female and this story is all boys, I very much identified with childhood friendships and adventures. I would see more movies if they left me with the wonderful feeling this movie does. Most movies leave me with a feeling of alienation and lost values. My all time favorite movie!
