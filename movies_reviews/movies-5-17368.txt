An incredible and extremely important film in a number of ways. It is one of the few pieces of state funded cinematic propoganda which is actually entertaining. It makes use of several (at the time) innovative cinemagraphic techniques, most of which are in common use today. The execution of mutineers, and the Odessa steps massacre sequences are spectacular.
