Ugh. You'd think that Samuel L. would have made a difference in this movie. At least, that's what I thought. The only reason that I didn't ask for my $10 back when the show ended is that I got to see Rammstein at the beginning of the movie (I'd pay $10 any day to see Till on a big screen). That, and the villian was mildly cool. Otherwise, the movie is trash.
