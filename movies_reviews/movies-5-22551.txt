Batman has to be considered an absolute classic. A movie that uses just enough of the comics but combines real life attributes to make Batman seem almost possible. A cast including Michael Keaton, Jack Nichalson, and Kim Basinger make the story one to watch. Keaton delivers big here, and of course, Jack Nicholson as the Joker steals the show.
