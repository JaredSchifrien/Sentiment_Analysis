When you read the plot and read what the movie is about, it sounds completely stupid. But if your patient enough and give it a chance, you'll find out that it is a very funny movie. Sigourney Weaver is extremely beautiful in this movie ( which is probably the reason I really liked the movie). Tim Allen's acting was well done.
