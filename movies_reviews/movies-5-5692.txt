The Greatest Movie of ALL TIME! Vivien Leigh is great as Scarlett O'Hara and she deserved every award for it. Mammy was very funny and provided a good dramatic foil for Scarlett. There is certainly great chemistry between Scarlett Rhett (Clark Gable) and will probably be remembered for all time and provide an example of what actors should do.
