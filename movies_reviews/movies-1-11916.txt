Not the greatest movie by any means. I personally thought Goldie Hawn was totally overacting and no where near her best. Susan Sarandon couldn't even pull it off, and I think she was even trying. These two women just don't have that chemistry that is required in these types of movies. I didn't even really like the storyline that well either. Save your money and don't waste any time with this one...
