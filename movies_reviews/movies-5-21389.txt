i would rate all the films in the original triology great but like most people(star wars fans in paticular) i would have to say this film is my favorite chapter of one big movie. this is were everything started getting interesting. han and leia falling in love, darth vaders stunning confession of absent fatherhood, yodas revealtion of another jedi. you get the point. still like star wars this still offered great action and cliffhanger type moments. the best balanced film of the the three. my fav part was when yoda lifted the x-wing out of the swamp accompanied by john williams powerful score for me that scene summed up the what jedi where all about as compared to empire who only used power for personal gain and control.
