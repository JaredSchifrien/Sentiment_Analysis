Probably the best vampire movie ever, and high up there in the pantheon of my personal favorites. No actor has ever essayed a more terrifying, repellent vampire than Max Schreck. All vampire movies that have been produced in the decades since are just pallid imitations of this masterpiece. The passage of time has done nothing to minimize its chilling potency. Even the re-make by genius film-maker Werner Herzog couldn't measure up.
