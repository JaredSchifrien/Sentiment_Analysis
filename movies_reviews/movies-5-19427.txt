I wish this movie was seen by more people but it never really got a market. This is one of my alltime favorites! Creepy, suspenseful, and the music is perfect! Nothing like an undertaker with seemingly super power strength and an evil purpose! Another one in the lines of Rosemary's Baby (not in storyline, but type) in that they don't get you with special effects so much as they do it with just plain creepy suspense........
