After seeing this I thought to myself, I really should have listened to those critics. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. After a thousand years of slavery the human race has forgotten everything that made them human. They didn't even know what a triangle was and yet they managed to learn how to fly, assemble a nuclear device and devise a plan to wipe out their enemies with their planet. And the makers of this crap had the gall to set up for a sequel. The only part I enjoyed was when Tavolta tried feeding the guy a rat.
