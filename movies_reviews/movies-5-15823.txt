Well, what a great assortment of comments. Especially from those disagreeing with the rating! I think that there was nothing pornographic or exploitive about sex. None of the advertisements I saw portrayed this movie as a sexual movie, therefore, no kids (by the way, are we no longer awknowledging the maturity difference between a 7 year old and a 17 year old?) would be attracted to this movie for the sexual content. Lets just assume that the folks who see this movie are adult and mature enough to take from the movie what it is offering. A impactful story about love, sex, hypocrisy, art, and censorship... The movie was wonderfully acted and directed. The costuming was great, the sets were great and the movie, despite some grim themes, was uplifting and empowering. I hope everyone enjoys this film, I know it is on my top 10.
