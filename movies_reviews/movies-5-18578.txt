Great movie, it may not seem scary but I watche dit at like three am and I jumped once or twice. How cool was it when he dismembered his girlfriend? THAT WAS AWESOME! WHat's up with the guy who's rating says "not my kind of movie." You should be dissqualified. people want to now how this movie stacks up not what your favorite color is or if you prefer vanilla over chocolate, you prick.
