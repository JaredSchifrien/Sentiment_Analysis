Incoherent, yes - but sometimes that's a good thing. This movie still stands out as unique 20+ years later - even when compared to the sequels and rip-offs. The main message of this movie is hope. Hope that more determined youths can muster the resources to film their stupid ideas untainted by studio or even audience expectation. By basking in other people's creativity we become less afraid of our own.
