My alltime favorite movie. I jsut noticed my SN is Ash_WIlliams too, not a coincidense. I respect people who sya this is the worst evil dead movie (I dissagree but respect them) but i hate people who complain that it's a bad movie cause it doesn't make sense, THAT'S BECAUSE THERE"S TWO OTHERS DAMMIT! AS for the guy who said he can't relate to Ash, no duh. DO you relate to The Governator in Predator? If you say you do, you're a jackass. DO you relate to Jack Burton in Big Trouble little CHina, man I doubt it. That doesn't make them bad nmovies now does it?
