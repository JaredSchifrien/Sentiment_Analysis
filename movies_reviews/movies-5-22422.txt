Wow! What an incredible movie! First Return of the Jedi was my favorite, then Phantom Menace and now Attack of the Clones! We're talking great acting, awesome special effects and battle scenes and even great humor with Jar-Jar and 3P0. Not even the extended length is a downer! Highly recommended for all!
