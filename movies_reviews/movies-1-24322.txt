What really burns me about this flick is that Martha sent me to Wal-Mart to buy some doo-dad she read in some insert ad in the paper. Now she knew about my "never again to Wal-Mart" vow, but quite frankly, Scarlett, she didn't give a damn! But I digress. I walked by the bargain DVD bin and lo and behold here was "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" for $4.99. The price and the bin should have tipped me off, but NOOOO! I BOUGHT IT. IT REALLY STINKS! I could have had two pale ales on tap for what I sank into this trash!
