Don't go see it. The local paper gave it an A-. The minus part was right. It's a story about people losing their hatred and bigotry and falling in love masked in a tale of death, more death, and even more death. Yes, Billy Bob Thornton is a great character actor. Halle Berry can act, too, and we get confirmation for anyone that didn't already know, that she has a great body. But, to watch sucicides, to watch electrocutions, and to watch parents ahting their children, and telling them to their faces, BLECHH.
