Just awful! Has Danny DeVito ever made a satisfying movie? Characters totally unbelievable, and Robin (who I like) having a total character reversal at the end after going in circles throughout the whole movie ( I'll kill him! I'll kill him! Oh, now I love him! Pleeeze!) Liked Norton, but what was the deal with Jon Stewart? And what's the point of all the vulgarity? I'm not a prude, but it's not funny anymore. And any 'comedy' that you can count the number of laughs (two) has a problem. Not even worthy of Blockbusters leftover table.
