More than just a horror flick - more than a great horror film - speaks volumes about society. Absolute classic. Every time she screams in panic when looking at him I'm on the Monster's side -whenever villagers run in fear - I'm on his side! It's entirely unrational, but I can't help it - rejection hurts!
