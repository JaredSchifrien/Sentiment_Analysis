This is by far one of the most brilliant and heart warming childrens animated films ever created. Te story of Fival the mouse and how he is seperated from his family while on their way to America. It featuers one of the sadest songs ever, Somewhere out There and is an absolutly wonderful movie. Avoid Fival goes West at all costs.
