This is one of the worst movies ever made. I did not laugh once. The jokes were very cliche and dull. Almost like the jokes I used to hear in elementary school. Really, is a man getting his butt crack waxed funny? The humor is rediculousely dumb to the point of making the viewer feel sorry for everyone involved. Word of advice if you like good comedies don't see anything by the production team who brought you Big Daddy or Deuce Bigalow. If you are a numb skull go check it out.
