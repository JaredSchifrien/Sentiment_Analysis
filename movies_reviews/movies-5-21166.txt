I absolutely LOVE this movie. Treat Williams was definitely the star of the show. The soundtrack is excellent. I love when he dances on the table and sings I Got Life. I've been watching this movie ever since I was little. To my fathers horror I used to sing some of the racier songs out loud (I had no idea what those words meant). Berger is a great character, and I never fail to cry at the end every time.
