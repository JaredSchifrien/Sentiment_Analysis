Noone moved in the theatre when the movie ended. Everyone was so quiet. It was like a morgue. Anyway, they were so quiet. Mel Gibson did an awesome job on this movie. The blood was there for a reason. It is there to portray the truth about how much pain and suffering Jesus went through to dye for us. Mel Gibson was awesome in this movie.
