Being John Malkovich can be described in one word - genius. The bizzare plot around which the film revolves, (A down and out puppeteer discovers a gateway into the mind of actor John Malkovich), could so easily have been handled in the wrong way but first time movie director Spike Jones' direction is next to flawless and his background as a commercial director is useful, as the film shifts gear from subtle to sublime to blatant a lot. The cast is well chosen, with John Cusack playing the puppeteer whos life is irreversably change by his discovery, and his character provides a good anchor for the plot, as he is infact the least eccentric of the lot. Cameron Diaz also proves decisivly in this picture that she can act well without the use of her looks, sporting a wig which would not look out of place lying on a motorway bleeding. The star of the show, Malkovich, is eccelent and in my opinion a vastly underrated actor. He acts himself in a truly believable way and is very clever in his acting when he is being 'possesed.' Look out for the scene where he enters his own mind portal - it is one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen in any film. All in all, the story is odd and brilliant, the cast is superb, the direction inspired and the end result is spectacular. This is one to buy, a real watch and watch again film.
