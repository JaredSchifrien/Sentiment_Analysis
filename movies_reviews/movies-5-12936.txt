 THANK YOU! FINALLY! A deep meaningful movie aimed at the men! This movie opened my eyes in more ways than I could possibly express in this review. It teaches you the imortant lessons of love, friendship, kindness,perserverance, dreams and being non violent. This is a movie that had me tearing up at the idea of one man making such a large difference. This is one of the greater movies, I belive, ever made.
