Despite the fact that I watched this movie on a flight from Boston to SFO, this movie was so bad I still thought about walking out on it. I used to like Will Farrell, but now after 29 movies over three years it has become apparent how one-dimensional and unoriginal he really is. He's the same character in every movie, and most recently they have all been bad movies. Nicole Kidman was at least a little (very little)likable in the movie, but she drops in my opinion -- guilt by association. What was she thinking taking on this role? This was one of the worst movies ever.
