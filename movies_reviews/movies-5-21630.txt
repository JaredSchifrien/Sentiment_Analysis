WHAT! There is no way this movie can beat The Godfather, or Citizen Kane (as someone here was claiming.) The character development is WEAK and the plot thread was Jumpy and difficult to follow. I would have been lost, had I not remembered parts of the book from reading it as a kid. Can this move beat STAR WARS? No way. Howfrigginever, I LOVED IT. It had me gripping the seat for 3 hours. I was just glad it didnt turn into melodramatic horse sh*t like titanic and other 'epics'. The cinematography was great, the SFX was tops, and the makeup and costume were fantastic. It was good movie-making, and not a platform for actors. That being said, I wish to marry Liv Tyler. She is Sooooo beautiful! Anyone know her?
