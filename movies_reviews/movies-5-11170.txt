Even thinking about this movie makes me chuckle. I just spontaneously start giggling when I think about those characters. Yes, the movie is way too crude and raunchy, even for my tastes, but the creativity of Eddie Murphy's characters makes up for that. This is not Shakespeare, so it's not the subtlety of the script I'm interested in. Okay, the truth is... I fast forward through the dumb parts , but the good parts are really, really good.
