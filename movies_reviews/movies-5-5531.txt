PSYCHO is the greatest suspense thriller (not horror movie) of all time, without question! Sure, it does move along at a slow pace, but such is necessary in order to build suspense. The first half hour builds up to the shower sequence, while the rest of the movie moves at the same pace in order to keep the apprehention in the minds of the audience. This is certainly one of the few times where a movie is made for the audience, while at the same time being absolutely spectacular!
