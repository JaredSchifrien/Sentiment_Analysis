Okay, now this kind of film, even for kids, is a real insult to filmgoers everywhere. In spite of all its dynamic advertising and cool posters, it turned out to be nothing all that special, just a series of grotesque animal fights with dodgy CGI and tacky weapons. The fact that it tried to preach the theory that all cats are evil and that it's only thanks to the companionship of dogs that we're all happy and free didn't do it any favours. I like cats myself, and actually found it alarmingly offensive, particularly the portrayal of all 'cat people' as fat, drippy women and the horrific 'educational' cartoon of Ancient Egyptian history in which everything gets disgustingly distorted. But it couldn't even make the best of such a dubious concept. The script was poor and disappointingly slow-paced, with jokes I'd heard a thousand times before, the puppetry, particularly for the Chinese hairless, was pathetic, the plot was tissue-thin, and acting, both people and voices, was really, really bad. Only the trained cats and dogs gave it any life and soul. Little attempt was actually made to develop the characters, even the animal ones (the least said about those irritating 'humans' the better). The plot? A puppy with an adult voice is accidentally called upon to protect a scientist working on a cure for dog allergies from cats trying to take over the world. Very, very tedious. Your kids deserve better than this. If you're a dog lover, you'd probably be better off giving this a miss. If you're a cat lover, avoid it like hell!
