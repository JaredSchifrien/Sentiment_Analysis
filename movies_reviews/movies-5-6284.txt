An absolutely timeless classic. The battle scenes are immense in their scope and impact. Winner of the best picture of 1930, this movie, like the machine gun whose inventer mistakenly thought his invention would mark an end to this kind of senseless carnage, did nothing to sway the powers that be from continuing to give future inspiration for moviemakers. The business of war is only good when shells and bullets are spent and young men die. The great military industrial complex thrives by supplying still more bullets, shells, and dispensable soldiers into the mix. This film was made with the idea that it be shown to the leaders of all nations hoping that they would see the futility of combat and shame them into bringing an end to this evil business. Think it's working yet?
