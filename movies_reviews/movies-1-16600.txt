I hate it when Hollywood gets all preachy and this movie was the ultimate in preachy. The liberals are innately good and conservatives are right-wing psychos is getting old. Didn't we already see this in An American President or on The West Wing? Stop it already!! Both sides have flaws so why doesn't Hollywood make more realistic movies about politics, like Primary Colors -- or how it should be, like Bullworth.
