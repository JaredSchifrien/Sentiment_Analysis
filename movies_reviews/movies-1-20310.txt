 What a waste. I have seen some terrible horror films in my day but for thr the love of Pete! this has got to the worst horror film in years and that is saying alot. Not only is the casting crap but the throw back to Alfred Hitchcock at the end made me want to choke the film maker. For them to think this movie could even be comparable to a Hitchcock masterpeice is beyond me. Deplorable and a joke to the horror movie fans. Watch it and be prepared for a boring evening.
