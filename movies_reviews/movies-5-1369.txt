Several of my guy college friends would keep Reservoir Dogs poster up on their walls. At that point I had not watched the movie. I thought that it was a typical guy movie. I found Reservoir Dogs very exiting, the images are very vivid. Especially as one guy (I think the police guy) got his ear cut off. The movie makes you get into the story, it's not just plain killing. Reservoir Dogs takes you into a roller coaster of emotions. So, this is a very intense movie. You got to watch it!!!
