The first time I saw this movie, I left the theatre shocked. This movie told the whole truth not only about American families, but all families around the world! Annete Bening was stunning, Thora Birch and Mena Suvari both were incredible, Wes Bentley was unbelievable but it was Kevin Spacey's role made me love him completely, what an acting! The role of Lester was difficult and Spacey made it to perfection.
