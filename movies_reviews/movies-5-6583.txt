 Who's affraid of Virginia Voolf? - one of the best american movies/ Beautiful producing, beautifulactors works, very delicate music and artist work. All done very exactly. Nothing superfluous, not any unwarrantable external effects, all concentrated on disclosure of theme and disclosure of imagines. I know not so much films, whichcan becompared with it in depth of psychological analysis and depth of it reslization.
