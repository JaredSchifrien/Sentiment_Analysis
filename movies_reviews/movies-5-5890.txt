Not only one of the greatest films of all-time but one of the greatest love stories of all time. The intriguing part is that it is unclear what Jimmy Stewart is in love with. The woman or the illusion of the woman. Hitch keeps the his characters and the viewer in constant disorientation in his best film. The soundtrack is also incredibly haunting.
