This is a beatiful movie, in the tradition of great french coming-of-age movies. It's not quite as magical as '400 Blows', but it aims for a different effect: it's both a very personal story about boys growing up, and a period piece about occupied France. I won't go into details, but if you like French cinema, see this movie.
