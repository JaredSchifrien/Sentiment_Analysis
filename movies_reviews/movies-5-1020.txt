It's been rather difficult of late doing without any Bruce Willis Die Hard Movies. Realizing of course how John McClain is pretty much worn out...ca-poots-kah..! But who can blame the dude, after all those disgusting messes those Grueber Dudes put him through. Ya know what I'm sayin? Those guys had John climbin up elevator shafts and shootin at him then blowin things up all around John...and terrible stuff like that. Oh well, thanks for the memorys John McClain you were a shining example of courage in the NYPD...fer sure dude. Perhaps now that John's pretty much exhausted his role as super NY Cop...well, maybe John can get on as a rent a cop with some late night warehouse in the east side of NY. Best movies ever; those Die Hard Series. Yep, no doubt about it...fer sure. John was the best.
