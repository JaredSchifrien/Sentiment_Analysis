The Princess Bride is one of the greatest films ever made. If your looking for adventure, fantasy, or romance you will find a fulfilling movie here. The actors are wonderful. The writing is excelent and the direction is fantastic. I recommend this movie for anyone. From age three to one hundred and three.
