When I first heard about Pearl Harbor, I saw it was around my birthday, so I decided to check it out. I went on the internet and all these critics were trashing it. I couldn't believe it, then I went to see the movie, and it was better than ever! Almost better than Star Wars! Everyone in the movie did an excellent job. This movie is for all to see.
