This was an excellent French film by the woman who starred in Amelie. Has some French regulars. Very engaging film taking place during World War I, about a polio infected woman searching for her lost lover who is missing in action as the war comes to an end. Very complex plot that unfolds beautifully. Jodie Foster plays a part in it, which eliminated the film from contention for best foreign film category at the Academy awards.
