One of the best comedies ever made. I have seen it about 40 times and I still laugh at it. Gene Wilder's Dr. Frankenstein is hilarious as a straight man in a world of comics. Marty Feldman shines as Eye-gor (Hump? What hump?). Peter Boyle expresses so much while barely having any lines. But Gene Hackman's blind cleric steals it all, as does Madeleine Kahn's virginal fiance. A must see for anyone, you'll laugh yourself silly.
