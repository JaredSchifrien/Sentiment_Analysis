Reluctantly attending the famous traditional forecast-by-groundhog ceremony,cynical weatherman Bill Murray finds the same day keeps repeating itself.As intriguing possibilities,including fresh chances to seduce resistant Andie McDowell, emerge,he must battle through despair towards redemption.Comfortably the best contemporary comedy (enhanced,for me,by falling on my birthday),this is a warmly romantic,uplifting and gleefully intelligent gem.
