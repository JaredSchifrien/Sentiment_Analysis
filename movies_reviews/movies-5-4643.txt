Gotta love that one. Yes, they are one of my favourite characters. This movie along with the other two that Aardman Productions had done are the best claymation I've ever seen; their countless hours on making this movie have shown why they are an award winning production. Any person at any age would appreciate this movie. We shall see if on Oct. 7, The Curse of the WereRabbit will live up to the hype of the original three W&G movies and Chicken Run.
