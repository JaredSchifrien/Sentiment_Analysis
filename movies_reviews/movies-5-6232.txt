I always knew this was one of the greats but didn't see it until later in life. What surprised me was that it was so funny and witty in a cheeky kind of way. I forget what it was called but there is a name for that overwrought style of acting they used back then. This movie seemed to break that rule a bit. I wonder if it was considered controversial or groundbreaking in it's time.
