As classic a film as ever there was. For a musical it tackled some pretty unusual stuff, from witchcraft, to invading nazis. The whole cast is good and the fun of it all is the convaluted storyline that leads the heroes to a climactic show down with the stormtroopers of nazi Germany by way of reanimated suits of armor. Some great stuff. Best Scene: The animated soccer match
