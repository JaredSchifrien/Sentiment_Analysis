I went to see this at the cinema with my friend for my 19th b'day (my partner was on holiday at the time - sob!) and we totally loved it. The best bit were definately the cats - I wasn't too keen on the rest. The main merit for this film is the computer graphics and a few witty lines, but I still think its a fun nonsensical film.
