Close Encounters is one of Speilberg's greatest films. This is one of the films that really popularized the alien/government conspiracy phenomenon. These were bold, fresh ideas when this film came out. Even after multiple viewings this film is still compelling. It is exciting, funny, frightening, whimsical and exhilirating. The writing, acting, musical score and directing are all superb.
