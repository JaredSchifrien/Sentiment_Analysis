56 million dollars!! how, as a movie watching culture, do we explain THIS! Scooby Doo is proof positive that the cinema, as well as the American Cultural landscape, have fallen into an irreversable void from which nothing of asthetic value is sure to never rise again. Sure, people took their kids? TAKE THEM TO THE MUSEUM INSTEAD!!! heck, at least go see Spirit AGAIN, before seeing this piece of Freddie Prinze Crap!!
