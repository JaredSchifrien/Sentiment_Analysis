As a closet Tim Burton fan, I was excited to see this film and while the odd pace of the movie slowed me down a bit, I wasn't disappointed. A visual extravaganza for the eyes, filled with fanciful sights and effects, it was delightful. The plot was fun and ambitious in its twists and turns. The always wonderful Ewan McGregor was charming and heart-warming. Billy Crudup also did a fantastic job. A darling movie that definitely be given a chance.
