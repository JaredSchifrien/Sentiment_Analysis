Well what can I say about this movie that hasn't already or soon will be said? It's absolute pure and unadulterated genius. Moulin Rouge never for a moment leaves you without some sort of compelling image or emotion. The actors have a powerful chemistry that manages to capture the audience's attention amidst all the frienzied goings-on. And that, I assure you, is quite a feat. And, of course, one would be remiss if one did not mention the shockingly good music! The retooled songs that I'm sure would sound corny in any other movie seem to fit perfectly in Moulin Rouge. The singing is surprisingly good as well, considering that the majority of it is done by two actors not widely known for their singing ability. I wish I could find ways to fully express to you, too, just how amazing just the visual..everything is. It's like nothing I've ever seen in entire life. You are forever being bombarded with some kind of elaborate image, a new and before unimaginable picture. It's really undescribable. Baz Lurrhman did an astonishing job on this film. The camera angles, the colors, the music, the actors, the sets, just everything was perfect. I would not have changed one thing. Not one minute of this truly beautiful movie is ever, ever wasted. Neither will your time if you go see it, so get off your booty and do so! Now! I command you!
