Oh my! I couldn't wait to see this movie and I was not dissappointed! Tom Hanks' character goes through so much and you feel it all with him! The crash scene was spectacular ( Iwas holding my breath), watching him survive in the island was amazing (you feel his lonliness yet will to survuve), and then watching him try to readjust back into a society after being alone for so long was heart-wrenching (post truamatic stress syndrome...). I would see it again! Helen Hunt also does a great job! It was the best movie I have ever seen with such little dialog! Go see it!
