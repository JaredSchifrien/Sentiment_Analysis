I think Mel Gibson did a great job, for his first time directing. The camera angles were perfect. The language really fit in with the scenery. People think the movie is grusome, but that is how it really happened! They are just showing you what it was like for jesus, and if you didn't like it then thats your own fault. I perticuarly liked it!
