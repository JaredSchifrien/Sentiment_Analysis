I have had more fun FLY FISHING! the only good part of this movie was Randy but of course as in all crappy movies the best guy dies in the sequel (Which was a great thing for Randy). I may have liked it back in the day but that was before I started to understand what made a great movie. If you find this movie good try shakeing a pen in front of the computer screen you might have more fun. I think you stabbed to deep man..
