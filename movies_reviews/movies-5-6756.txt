Always thought this was one of the best of the classic scary movies for its sheer monstrosity and scale of destruction. And the people who made it originally in '54 were only 11 years past being nuked! They knew something about monstrous terror and this film was an apt metaphor of dealing with the forces of nature unleashed.
