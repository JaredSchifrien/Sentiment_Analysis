With all the hoopla about this film, I determined to watch it. I'd heard that some viewers in the theater were so frightened that they would vomit, etc. Well now I see why they were vomiting, but it surely wasn't from fright. The vomiting had to come from one of two sources: (1) bad popcorn or candy, etc., or (2) the awful stench emanating from this terrible flick!
