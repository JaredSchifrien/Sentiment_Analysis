Hey, im only 15 and I think Seven Samurai is the best film ever. I wish more people my age would watch it. I would hate for this film to be dubbed, It would take all its charm away. Everyone should stop whining about how long it is and how much reading there is. First of all, to fit all that great story into a movie, it has to be long. Second, if you dont like reading all that, to bad, you probly need to read more anyways. I give this movie an A+, go ahead and find a better foriegn movie, I dare you...
