I think this is the best movie I have seen this year. It is technically brilliant (using new performance capture techniques) and beautiful visually. It has good action and comedy and provides a message, about courage and belief, that all, not just children can take to heart. Eventually, I think this will be a beloved Christmas movie and regarded as one of the best movies of the decade.
