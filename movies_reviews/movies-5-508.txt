The best gangster movie of all time--better than The Godfather. It's not so much a story, but rather an extremely entertaining collection of classic scenes. One of those rare films that you love more every time you see it. Superb use of oldies music. GoodFellas really engages you from the start, and takes you on one heckuva ride. Maybe not his best (Raging Bull is), but definitely Scorsese's most entertaining movie.
