Using the original sets from the classic Universal Frankenstein movies, Gene Wilder as Frederick Frankenstein ("That's Fronkensteen.") creates his monster with the aid of his sexy blonde lab assistant Inga (Teri Garr), and his bumbling, bug-eyed, hunchback Igor (Marty Feldman.) Mel Brooks' was huge in the year 1974 as he released his two most noted films 'Young Frankenstein' and 'Balzing Saddles' to the delight of comedy fans everywhere. Here he parodies the original 'Frankenstein', 'The Bride of Frankenstein', 'Son of Frankenstein', and 'The House of Frankenstein' with a few musical comedy numbers thrown in for good measure. Madeline Kahn, Kenneth Mars, and Gene Hackman provide a series of hilarious send-ups as Elizabeth, (Frederick's fiance) police inspector Kemp, and the blind man, while Peter Boyle uses grunts, growls, and facial expressions to breathe life into his portrayal of "the Monster." Wilder is his usual sometimes calm, sometimes exasperated self as he attempts to interact with this group of crazies and use his genius to carry on with his famous relative's work. Cloris Leachman is a laugh riot as the former girlfriend of the senior Frankenstein and current housekeeper for the castle. One of the best comedies of all time and well worthy of it's lofty rating among the entries here. Do yourself a huge favor and see view this film. You might pick up a copy of 'Blazing Saddles' and make it a double-feature.
