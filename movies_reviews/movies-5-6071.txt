The movie 'The Warriors was popular when my kids were teens so I thought it was a good idea to show them a gang related movie from my era. Needless to say, I still haven,t lived it down, as my sons found it very corny. In my high school,every boy was wearing a purple shirt after that movie came out. It,s tough to get old!
