Terrible! Halle Berry what were you thinking? The storyline is stupid, the acting is boring,and the plot never takes off. No chemistry at all between Benjamin Bratt and Halle Berry, oh and that terrible Catwoman suit and boots. The movie should be in the comedy category , instead of action movie . The critics were right on the money this time.
