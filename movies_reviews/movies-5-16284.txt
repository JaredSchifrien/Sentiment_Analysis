I know it has doctrinal points that differ from mine, but I don't expect doctrinal perfection from a movie. I liked the Passion because it was powerful and moving. Mel Gibson put a lot of money and effort into this movie, and I'm glad he did. I went away with a renewed appreciation for the suffering and humiliation that Jesus endured on my behalf. Great movie, Mel.
