Very, very solid movie. Jack Black was surprisingly good in this one. The special effects are mind blowing. Peter Jackson hits one over the fence again! My one question would be, "What is with the sleeveless dress, in December, in New york city at the top of the Empire State Building?" The girl is unphased and can climb ladders in that kind of weather?
