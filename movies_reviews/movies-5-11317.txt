One of the most hilarious movies of the 80's ! I have only had the chance to see it twice, but someday will take the time to rent it again, or maybe even buy it. It is well worth the money. I thought this movie was done in great taste, and Pee Wee seemed so naive and innocent thru out the whole Big Adventure. Like most other reviewers on this website, there are so many scenes and lines that could never be forgotten, they are so memorable. I always hoped there would be a part 2 to this particular movie, but I guess it is best to leave well enough alone in this case. Or maybe there were plans for a second one until Pee Wee had fun with the willy? Who knows? But I certainly don't think Pee Wee should be condemned for enjoying masturbation, as it is natural. But he could have kept it in the bedroom, that is for sure. And like the Bee said, he isn't the only one in Hollywood who does these kinds of things, but Pee Wee just didn't get away with it.
