If you liked Apollo 13, you'll love the Right Stuff. The movie runs a little long, but supplies an almost complete look at the Mercury program. Ed Harris and Scott Glenn are excellent. Dennis Quaid and Fred Ward provide perfect support to create a cast of well played charcters. This history is interesting enough by itself that embelishment is unnecessary. Jeff Goldbloom bothers me though.
