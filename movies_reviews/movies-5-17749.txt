Unquestionably the greatest horror film of all time! This movie is perhaps one of the most influential movies of its time, setting the stage for ripoffs like Friday the 13th. This movie keeps an eerie feel to it all the way until the end, and Michael Myers is definitely one of the most dynamic characters ever depicted in a horror film. Props to John Carpenter for the creepy music in this film.
