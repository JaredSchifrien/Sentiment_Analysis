The Lion King is my favorite animated Disney film. It has great storylines, good writing, good music, powerful messages for its viewers. The characters blend well with the plot. I like the fact that it covers the life cycle really well: antelopes eat grass, antelopes are eaten by lions, when lions perish they before grass, which antelopes eat. WOW, that a breath of fresh air. This movie is truly a classic for generation to come. May it never be forgotten!
