One of the best horror flicks I've seen.Rob Zombie did an excellent job directing this.The Cinematography is ingenious.I do not recommend this for kids or the squeamish.The acting is top-notch and the casting is perfect.Karen Black returns to the screen as the Mother of a brood of psychopaths.Cherri Moon is both sexy and scary-talk about a "femme fatelle"! Yipes! Towards the end it gets very strange and almost surreal.
