This movie was the BEST version of Jesus's finale twelve hour EVER made!!!Mel Gibson is BRILLIANT!!!Poor Jesus!!He had to go through ALL that hell to save the ENTIRE human race for our sins!!!And I am so SICK of people insulting the s--- out of Mel and his movie!!!I KNOW that the movie was VERY violent.But that's 'cause it HAD to be.That how brutal Jesus's crucification REALLY was!!!Mel wanted his version to be the MOST realistic to the actual event,and he worked his ASS of to do it!!!I admit that he slightly overdid it with the violence a bit.That's why he went back and edited some of the unnessicary violence in "The Passion Recut".OKAY?!!!Now NO more bitching!!!Alright!!!
