I really like Misery. Yes I guess you could consider it a horror film but I think if it more as a thriller with some horrible bits in it. More of a Hitchcock-esque sort of horror. Not all blood and guts but a really drawn out sort of oh my god how awful kind of horror. It really draws you into his situation and how helpless he becomes and fearful and at the same time totally dependent.
