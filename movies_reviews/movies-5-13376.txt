RUN FORREST RUN!! Mama always said that life was like a box of chocolates, you never know what your gonna get. This movie is absolutly hilarious! Tom Hanks did such a good job, but I found a lot of adult content in it, and that turned me off a bit. But, I suppose thats the going rate for a good movie.
