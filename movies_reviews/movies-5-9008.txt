I don't know why this isn't in the classics. First time I watched this I thought it was absolutely hilarious! Woody Allen writes the greatest one-liners, and Diane Keaton is great as Annie Hall herself. I consider this possibly Woody Allen's best film. Even if it has a simple story it's still an absolute classic. Summary: ONE OF THE FUNNIEST AND GREATEST FILMS EVER.
