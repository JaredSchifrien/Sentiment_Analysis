A very good movie. Bette DAvis plays a famous stage actress Margo Channing. Eve is a young actress want to be who claims to be a huge fan of Margo Channing she even charms her way into Margo Channings life by moving in with her as an assistant. Time goes by and we see that Eve is Not the sweet doting fan she pretends to be. It turns out that Eve wants to be an actress and we see she will stop at nothing to get what she wants. Bette Davis is great as the getting older Margo{ if you can call 40 old!}who trusted Eve and was later betrayed by her. Marilyn Monroe has a small role in the movie too. All the actors are good in their roles. A Little too long but a very good movie.
