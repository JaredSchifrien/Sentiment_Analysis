I'm much more of a baseball guy myself, and never thought that I would enjoy a movie about football. But boy was I wrong! This movie had it all: action, drama, comedy, and great acting. I thought that it did a great job of balancing out the typical Disney atmosphere ( feel good type movies) with the true hardships that both races had to face when integration was implemented in the 50s, 60s and 70s. I thought that this was a very touching film about acceptance, understanding and tolerance, topped off with some great music and one hell of a great cast.
