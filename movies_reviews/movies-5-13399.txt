I think I have heard this moving quoted more times then any other movie since it's making. And I still laugh at it! The movie is one of those icons that will never die. Tom Hanks performance was incredible, as was Robin Wright. I don't think that he will ever have matching talent for a movie again, or not so far he hasn't. Wonderful movie!! Run, Forest, Run!!!!
