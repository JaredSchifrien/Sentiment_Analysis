my second favorite movie of all time and what a great one! wonderfully twisted, smart, and funny. I love the irony(violence mixed with a happy song). they may have over done it with the nudity but that doesn't matter. great acting. this movie is mispercieved by many people, the main idea about this movie is that society wants us to be machines but they have to remember that we are still human, that's what the title is about. one of the best movies of all time.
