Anonymous (The fraud one) must be a British Subject. While this movie is a compilation of multiple stories from the Revolution, it has a good historical base. A very heart ripping movie, that should motivate any American to be proud of our forefathers. As a devout Constitutionalist, I found the scenes regarding the Militia and firearms ownership and use to be exceptional. A must see movie.
