This movie ultimately resulted in me getting fired from my summer job in High School. Like Ferris, I began doing fun and interesting things instead of wasting my time in a place I didn't want to be. I went canoeing, I went golfing, I took roadtrips. Unlike Ferris, I was held accountable for my actions, and was fired.
