Dear Rudy, are you kidding? The Godfather well done? This is one of the best movies ever made. And the BEST move ie eve made for this genre. A must for any collection. I have it in BETA (A special editon that was reedited by Coppala with Godfather 2 so that the story of Vito Corleone is told in proper chronelogical order.)and VHS and hopefully soon in DVD.
