This movie was deplorable in every aspect! From the slow boring beginning to the overly predictable ending, I could barely sit still through this movie. As tempted as I was to fastforward through the entire thing, I FORCED myself to sit through it in order to give it a fair rating. Granted, the movie producers were going for a black and white effect. Something classy. Memories from an archaic past. Blah blah blah. And this is the only reason why it got 1 star. No, that's not right. It's because I couldn't give it a BIG FAT 0!!! The violence in the movie was uncalled for. Even I felt sorry for those women in the movie and my wife had to leave the room because she was so offended. Thank God my daughters weren't home the night I chose to watch it. How somebody could write up such a ghastly horror wannabe flick is beyond me. It sure felt like a horror, only a cheaper, gross-out scale. Bravo to the producers/writers for giving more serial killers out there ideas on how to murder women. Now we have crazy men portrayed in such acts as hanging women's heads on walls as mantels and eating the live flesh from their fingers and forcing them to watch it being done. Enough said. This was absolute crap! Don't waste your time! I won't even mention the acting because there was not much of it to comment on.
