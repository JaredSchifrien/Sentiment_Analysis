I really love this movie and think Rosalind Russell gave a sterling performance as Mama Rose. Based on the life of Gypsy Rose Lee (played by Natalie Wood), it showed how Mama Rose pushed her daughters into stardom in the vaudeville days. Mama really wanted to be the star herself and lived vicariously through her daughters. Excellent songs - Everything's Coming Up Roses for this film.
