 The Green Mile is a movie that I probably will never fully forget, because it succeeded in not only grabbing my attention but also grabbing my emotions. I laughed and I cried during this movie, and watching it was worth every minute. The plot was solid, and the acting was supurb. Props to Michael Clarke Duncan for his phenominal performance as John Coffey, an African American falsely accused of killing two young girls and awaiting execution. We discover that he has the ability to heal, and that he is truly God's Miracle . Also great performances as usual by Tom Hanks and James Cromwell. Highly reccomended!
