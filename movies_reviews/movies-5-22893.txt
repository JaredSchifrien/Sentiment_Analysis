Great movie that those who only look at the surface won't see the depth of the movie. it is the type that has flash for those who don't get the depth. Either way you will probably like it. In the end, you will understand where the third movie is going, unless you have never read a single X-men comic, watched a single cartoon ect ect. They once again focused in more on wolverine than on the other merry mutants, however some fan favorites made cameos which made at least one fan fairly happy.
