Wow. What a great film. It's nice to see something like this come along, especially right when you're ready to give up on a genre. Kidman is amazing in this. All of the performances were top-notch, and the story was well crafted. Keeps you guessing right until that mind blowing plot twist that I'm still marveling over.
