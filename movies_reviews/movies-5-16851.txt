Caught the movie last night. It seems that the critics were right on only ONE thing - that there wasn't enough development of Cole's relationship with any of the ranch family. It was like watching an accelerated version of the book. Matt Damon and Henry Thomas were exceptional, and whoever was cast as The Captain - BRAVO! He gave me the willies just like in the book. Saw it with friends who hadn't read the book and they really liked it, too...
