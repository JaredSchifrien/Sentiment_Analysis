The peace with the Klingons seen in Star Trek: The Next Generation is explained in this feature film, the last adventure with all of the original crew. The plot is interesting, the special effects (especially the ones in the spacedock and the space battles) are great and the characters, of course, play well off each other. Highly recommended!
