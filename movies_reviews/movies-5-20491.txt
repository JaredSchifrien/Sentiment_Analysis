I really enjoyed the movie. I found the animation very imaginative. Like Sava, I also found the Firebird Suite selection the most effecting and I left the theatre misty-eyed. That was a very moving and spiritual ending! It would be great to see what they could do with the last ten minutes of Mahler's symphony No.8 for the next Fantasia! Symbolizing the movements of planets and stars, it goes from soft choral sounds to great symphonic triumph! It really sounds like it could be the ending of a great great movie!
