If this is a true story, I'd say that it is quite great to see other than cats and dogs try to find their owner thatthey love so much. Keep in mind that parrots can live as long as humans, so it was a great ending to see Paulie and Marie reunite after more than a decade of separation, and for the single janitor who helped the parrot escape the institution and find her can live happliy ever after since Paulie convinced him to fall in love with Marie. After seeing the movie, you can see how touching these three coped with adversity.
