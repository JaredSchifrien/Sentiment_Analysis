Wow...to this day this movie sends chills down my spine...I remember when it was first released and I saw it...Halloween for me after that was never quite the same! The first and best in the slasher series of films that came out in the late 70's and 80's, this is the classic and best in that genre of horror. The brilliance here is that we never see Michael Myers real face...we as the audience are allowed to be in his character when the camera wears his mask and we are looking out of two eyes...and this is one movie where the music adds so much to the feel and tension of the action. Like most horror movies, there is some predictability...like how there are a certain number of disposable characters who you know are just going to end up at the wrong place at the wrong time. This was the best of the group of Halloween movies...the others that followed were horrible...
