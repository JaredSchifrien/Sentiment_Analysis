Al Pacino gave a great performance. His character was real lovable but you had to get used to him first. He taught that kid a lot about character. I almost cried when he came to the defense for his friend at the trial. I was happy that the kid got out of trouble with the help of his friend. This was a good drama. Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors.
