Wow, lookit all the comments for this movie. Looks like it's up to me to say something :) This movie I found a real treat for pretty much everybody. As far as twists and turns go, you really can't do much better...although I never really did process who Cary Grant ended up being (Was it Thadius? It was Thadius, right?) Audrey Hepburn is particularly good in this movie and she pretty much makes it work. And I'm fourteen years old, so don't you tell me this movie's for old people! I highly recommend it and say go buy it right now!!
