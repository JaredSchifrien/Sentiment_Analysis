This is one of the best classical movies ever. It feautures an all-star performance by Robert Mithcum who is definitely at his creepiest. It also stars film legend Gregory Peck, along with Telly Savalas, and Martin Balsam. It has loads of suspense and some of the best acting ever filmed. This film is a definite must see, for all movie fans, young or old.
