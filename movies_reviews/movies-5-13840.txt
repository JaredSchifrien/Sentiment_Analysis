I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the teaming of Bates and Tandy worked great. I live a few miles from the Whistle Stop cafe and it is such a quaint place to go. It is like going back in time, and looks just like it did in the movie. No matter what you order you will get a fried green tomatoe on your plate. The food is very good and their fried green tomatoes are great.
