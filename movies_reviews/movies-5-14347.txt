This was an amazing film. I thought that the cinematography was fantastic, and all though it was quite graphic, the reality of it was very raw and drew me in. It is emotional and depressing, but enthralling and very well done. It is most definatley a movie that you need to watch closely and pay attention to- it is deep and detailed. 5 stars without a doubt.
