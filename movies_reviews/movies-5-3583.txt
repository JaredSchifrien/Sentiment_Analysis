This probably one of those movies that people either love or completely hate. If you don't get it, you'll hate it, and if you get it, you'll love it. And if you say that you get it and still hate it, then you don't get it. You may understand intellectually everything about the film, but true understanding of this kind of thing is visceral. But don't feel bad, I'm not criticizing anyone who doesn't understand, I totally admit that this film is not for everyone. Terence Malick (Badlands) has got one of the best eyes for nature that I've ever encountered, and the setting for the movie (Guadalcanal I believe) is like heaven on earth, into which descends one of the very worst thing that humanity has invented (war). The scenery is the most beautiful I've ever seen in a movie that wasn't CGI'd, so it retains a realism and a soul, and so serves as yet another character in this ridiculously impressive cast. I was glad I wasn't expecting another typical war movie, because I can see how one would be disappointed. This movie is not about war; WWII is just the setting. You can find beauty, even in the ugliness that is war, if you are able to look with the right kind of eyes. Beautiful movie.
