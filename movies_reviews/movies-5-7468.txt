A very funny, super-likable movie that capitalizes on that anxiety we all feel about meeting a significant other's family for the first time. Ben Stiller plays the good-hearted everyman to perfection, so it's absolutely distressing to watch him stumble through this series of (hilarious) misfortunes. Though I've never been a huge Robert DeNiro fan, he is rather convincing as the intimidating father. On the negative side, the movie fails to develop the female character very well (to the point that you'll wish Stiller's character would just give up, since she doesn't seem worth the suffering he endures), and the happy ending gets stitched together pretty unconvincingly. But these are small nitpicks -- overall, it's an excellent comedy that (together with Something About Mary) establishes Stiller as one of Hollywood's most reliably funny leading men.
