This movie wins you casually, as though not seeming to have to make an effort despite its grandeur and scope, with one of the great all time novels watching its back. The actors have a lot of fun with their roles, and the action is great. The scenery, costumes, ironies, romance, are all ideallic. Strongly recommended.
