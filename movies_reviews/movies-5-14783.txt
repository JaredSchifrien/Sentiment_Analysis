This is a heart-warming, beautiful movie. I couldn't get over it after I saw it, it was so beautiful. Binoche, Molina, Dench, Depp, the whole damn cast (including The Matrix's Carrie-Anne Moss) are perfect. I felt like having some chocolate after seeing this. Other than the fact it's a French villiage and they all speak English with French Accents (what're they gonna do?), this was a beautiful movie. Recommended. Summary: A BEAUTIFUL HART-WARMING MOVIE.
