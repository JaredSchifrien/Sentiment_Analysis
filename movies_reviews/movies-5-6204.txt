Obviously, I have an affinity for this movie. I think it is the greatest depiction in ANY medium of the battle of the sexes, of the left vs. right brain, of art vs. mediocrity, illusion vs. reality, language vs. culture. In addition, there is no better acting to be found in ANY other film. Williams understood society better than he understood himself.
