This is one of the best movies out. When it first came out I was one of those people who was like OH GOD , more Harry Potter, but I was very surprised. I LOVED it, cause its not just a kids movie. I still though dont understand it when people say it makes kids want to practice witchcraft. Also people say it tells lies, well c'mon, its a fairytale type book movie. That means some things in the book are gonna be fake, just like the fairytales adults heard when they were little, not everyhting in those stories are true. But anywayz....its a really good movie. I reccomend going to see it, if you dont wanna spend the money for it in the theaters (cause movies in theaters are so expensive now), rent it when it comes out on video. Its surprisingly really good!!Some parts in the movie arent all good for little little kids, like in one part, I cant believe they swore, I was like huh, what did he just say? :) Oh the main little girl in the movie (cant think of her name right now) is really cute!
