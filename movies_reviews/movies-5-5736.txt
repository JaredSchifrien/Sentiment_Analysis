One of my favorite Hitchcock movies. You have to take the movie in context of when it was released. For the 60's this movie was quite chilling. The suspense alone is sheer genius, and the effects were outstanding at this point is cinema's history. The perfomances were perfect, Hedren did amazingly well for her first film, and portrayed the typical socialite brilliantly. Taylor was the typical male "hero", and Tandy was wonderfully annoying as the ever watchful mother. I admit to thinking immediately of this movie whenever I see a flock of seagulls when I go to the beach. So that's gotta say something for the movies impact on our subconcious!!!
