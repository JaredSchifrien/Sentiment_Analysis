This movie was absolutely fantastic. As a movie, a documentary, and a political attack. I honestly believe that anyone can appreciate it. There were times when he took cheap shots at Bush, or times when he made is point through innuendo and not a solid case, but no one ever said this film is supposed to be fair. Conservatives are screaming propaganda (which is histrionic because, with the above criticisms in mind, he still uses pure facts) But even if it is; I say its about time. After all, conservatives have a 24-hour propaganda machine called Fox News, which lies and distorts information, but tries to passs as a legitamate disperser of news. The opposition finally has a voice....the true lovers of democracy-true patriots finally have a voice! Hurray for Michael Moore for breaking down the Bush Barrier of lies and deception!
