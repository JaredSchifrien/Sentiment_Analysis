This was considered a cult classic comedy. The stars were Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort. They both had a preoccupation with death and loved going to funerals, which is where they met. There were some hysterical scenes in the movie, like Maude driving a pick-up truck and trying to rescue a tree that was dying, while police were chasing her. You have to have the right sense of humor to enjoy this, but many of us have seen it over and over.
