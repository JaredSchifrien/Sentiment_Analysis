I've walked out of only two movies in my life, and one was Nurse Betty (the other was Endless Love, to give you some perspective). I went in expecting a light, entertaining comedy, and what I saw instead was graphic violence and really terrible acting. The movie is about a waitress who witnesses a serious crime, has a break with reality, and then believes she's an actress in her favorite soap opera. With a plot like that, I felt sure I was in for lots of laughs. What a shock it was to see the serious crime depicted in a very realistic, horrifying way and more violence (including lots of blood and gore) in subsequent scenes. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, playing the killers after Nurse Betty, should be ashamed of themselves. Their roles were definitely beneath them, and one of the worst parts was that no one in the theater laughed at any of their jokes. It was pathetic! I still feel disturbed by the violence I saw in the first hour of the movie. You have been warned!
