A daunting tale of drug-induced decadence and how the lead character Renton and a few of his friends effectively abandon the crushing tedium of their everyday poverty-stricken lives and head into a downward spiral of addiction with some terrifying (and vividly portrayed) consequences. Robert Carlyle and Ewan McGregor are both superb actors and no less so in this film. Excellent soundtrack too, I listen to it all the time, includes Iggy Pop's Lust for life and Underworld's classic Born Slippy (which if you listen to long enough and loud enough you'll feel like you're on drugs!).
