The ultimate date movie. This little-known laugh riot only lasted in theatres maybe one week before going straight to video and cable. Love Stinks makes Fatal Attraction look like a ride at Disneyland. The humor is raunchy at times--but every zinger is so intelligently written that you can't help but get absorbed by the chemistry shared between the beautiful, but oh-so possessive Bridgette Wilson and the nice guy pushed too far antics of French Stewart (from T.V.'s 3rd Rock) Of course, the true lovers of this flick will be the ones that have first-hand experience of bitter break-ups.
