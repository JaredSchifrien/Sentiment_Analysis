Great freaking movie! Everytime I hear Hey these blow up into funny shapes at all? Well, no not unless round is funny I tell ya I just can't help but laugh. Or Alright you hayseeds it's a stickup! Everybody freeze. Everybody down on the ground. (Long pause) Hayseed: Well, which is it Young Feller? You want I should freeze or get down on the ground? I mean to say, if'n I freeze I can't rightly drop. And if'n I drop, I'm gonna be in motion. Y'see... Shut up! Hayseed: Ok then.
