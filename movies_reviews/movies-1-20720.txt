Although the movie is nearly devoid of objectionable content (aside from the occasional profanity), there are two things that absolutely destroy the movie. First, the songs are extremely grating and annoying. Second, the sexism in this production is outrageous. No more is this obvious than the shockingly-inappropirate ending. The ending is completely different than the short story, Pygmmalion, that this 1964 movie is based on. I just can't recommend this production.
