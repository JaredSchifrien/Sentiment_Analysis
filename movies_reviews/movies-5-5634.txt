Man I have seen a lot of take-offs of this. Shows how absolutely great, inspirational and essential it is - - not to mention suspenseful, chilling, and brilliant. When I watched it the first time I didn't know if the neighbour was guilty or innocent, it was all a big mystery. This is an absolute masterpiece, one of Hitchcock's greatest, and simply not to be missed. Hasn't aged one bit. Summary: AN ESSENTIAL, BRILLIANT, CHILLING MASTERPIECE.
