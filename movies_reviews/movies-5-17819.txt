Most people are looking for Stephen King's novel brought to life - but Kubrick basically abandoned everything King had described aside from names and the basic plot line. Kubrick just used the spine of the novel to create his masterpiece around. He also had many different purposes for changing things - and even though I read the book first, I think Kubrick's movie tells a better, more real, effective and horrifying tale.
