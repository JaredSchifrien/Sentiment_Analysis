Sweet and perhaps a little mindless, it sets out to entertain and accomplishes it's goal- sneaking some life lessons under all that blonde. The comedy factor is fun and steady, smartly written. Reese Witherspoon is utterly charming. Her acting is perky, concise and honest. The movie is nothing deep but its certainly amusing and enjoyable.
