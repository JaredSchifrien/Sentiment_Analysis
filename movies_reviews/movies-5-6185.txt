I adore this movie. Audrey *IS* Holly Golightly. It is hard to believe that Truman Capote actually wanted Marilyn Monroe for the part! Some criticize the movie because of how different it was from the novel, but personally I thought the movie was better. Call me sappy, but I love the happy ending. There are so many things that I love about this movie! Audrey, Moon River, the hilarious party scene, cat , Audrey's dresses, the happy yet STRONG ending.. I could go on and on.
