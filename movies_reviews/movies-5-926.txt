Released in 1975, Steven Spielberg's Jaws set the standard for summer blockbuster movies that we now take for granted. For those who have been too afraid to get in the water, the film is set in the New England coastal town of Amity which is suddenly plagued by a Great White Shark right before the summer season. Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) is thereby put in conflict with Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) who realizes that closing the beaches will devastate the town's tourist based economy. Nevertheless, push eventually comes to bites and Body sets off to kill the shark with ichthyologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and the crusty old salt Quint (Robert Shaw) on the latter's boat, the Orca. Besides flawless casting, Spielberg uses camera angles, deep focus, contrasting dialogue, and literary and historical allusions and references (eg Moby Dick and the sinking of the U.S.S. Indianapolis) to build tension and mood. For instance, taking advantage of a flawed fake prop, Spielberg shows the attacks from the shark's point of view which adds mystery and the horror of the unknown and uncontrolled. The bottom line is that the music, scenes (eg the battle of the scars), and lines (eg You're gonna need a bigger boat) from Jaws are all now part of the common human experience.
