You know, when you don't have the toilet paper throwing and screaming, and can actually hear the lines, you discover that there's actually some very clever satire that plays on old science fiction and horror movies. Sort of an early MS3000 type humor put into a film rather than beside it. And the songs always ring through my head, especially the half naked Susan Sarandan singing "touchatouchatouchatouchatouch meee...." Well, the image anyway.
