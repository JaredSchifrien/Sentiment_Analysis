This is a movie on crack.....BUT IT'S HILARIOUS. Forget about judging this movie on plot and acting mereit. It's pointless. What's makes this movie so great to watch is the action, the jokes, and it's vulgarity. This has to be the most vulgar movie in existance. I have never heard the word F^$* used so many times in a move (it's definitely in the 200s). The thing is, IT'S SO HILARIOUS to hear how much every character cusses in this movie. You'll never stop laughing. Some of the actions scenes are a bit ludicrs and gory as well (Meatloaf's body blows up, and the walls in the room turn all red). If you want to enjoy yourself and get a REALLY GOOD LAUGH, you'll get your money's worth with FORMULA 51.
