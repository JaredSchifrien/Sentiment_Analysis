This movie is outstanding. Everything seems real in this movie; the relationships, the characters, the emotions. And that is not very common in the movies these days. Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Tom Cruise are able to create intense chemistry in the player / agent relationship and the little kid is really cute as well. I'm surprised this movie wasn't more of a hit - guys like it because it's about sports, and girls like it because it addresses relationships.
