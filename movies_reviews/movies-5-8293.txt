At last, a fresh and energetic look at Christianity! An outragously funny film that doesn't take itself to seriously. For all you loud mouth christians out there who find this movie blasphemous, just read the credits before the flick starts. They state it is a work of fiction, and not to be taken seriously. Although, alot of the points it makes begs to be taken seriously. Alanis Morrisette as God is a piece of genius. I am not a big Chris Rock fan, but as Rufus, the 13th Apostle, he is terrific. Semla Hayek as Serandipity the Muse is perfect. THis is a great film. Asw for Christians being offended, Hell, I am a devout Atheist and even Iwas offended!
