Oh I LOVE this movie! Um, not so much the ending. I don't want to give anything away, but some ppl might not like the ending. But OVERALL this movie rules! I'm giving it the full 5 stars, for amazing graphics and forth-coming efforts! Congratulations Squaresoft! Give us another movie, but make it less Sci-fi and more fantasy-like.
