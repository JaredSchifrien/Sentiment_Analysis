Where should I start....Well this movie is just adorable!!!At 1st I wasnt too sure if I wanted ta c this movie but now i am very glad i did!! : ) There are very famous people who take the roles of the animals...for instance....there is ALEC BALDWIN and Charleton Heston..In this movie the dogs and the cats are enemies...The movie is about the cats trying to make every human in the world be allergic to dogs...and the dogs are going to have to try and stop them. If u like to c movies where animals talk this would be the movie 4 u....IT has adventure....comedy..and just a tad of drama in it....I already want to c it again....IT is just too cute!Go c it I recommend that u do!!!!! : o )
