It took me literally years to sit down and actually watch the whole thing, and even then it took two nights, but I'm glad I finally did. I always felt that this was a bit of a chick flick , but it's well worth watching for everyone. It's one of the few epic movies that actually contains a solid story throughout, while still maintaining the viewer's interest. The acting was excellent throughout as well, but I guess I'm one of the few who think that Clark Gable's famous line at the end frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn was delivered with a lack of enthusiasm on his part.
