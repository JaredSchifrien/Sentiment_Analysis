People either love it or hate it and that's because it strikes a chord. This movie had some of the best costume and set design I've ever seen. I sure hope they had a bunch of fire extinguishers for the vault scene. The soundtrack was also incredible and I'm still trying to find a recording of the opera singing in the death scene. Though it's violent, it's also sharp, exhilarating and a blow to the senses. This is one movie where I thought DiCaprio did some decent acting, once you get past his teen idol facade. Luhrman went out on a limb with this one and I thought he stayed very true to the ambiance that Shakespeare created. I'm sure it shocked some, but it's just so damn creative!
