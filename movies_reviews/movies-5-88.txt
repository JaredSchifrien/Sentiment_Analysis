I am not usually a fan of thriller movies. Especially those slasher ones. This one was good. Anthony Hopkins was great a s Hannibal Lector. A psychiatrist who is in jail for murdering people and eating them. Yet he has a brilliant mind about understanding the minds of killers. There is another serial killer on the lose who kidnaps women skins them and kills. them . Jodie fosters plays Clarice who is hired to investigate the crimes and help find the killer. She goes to Hannibal who is in maximum security to talk with Hannibal to help find the killer. he agrees help so he can be transferred.there are some good chillingly frightening scenes in this movie between Hannibal, Clarice and tracking down the next serial killer who we do get to see,{ a real freak of a guy}as thrillers go this was a pretty well done movie.
