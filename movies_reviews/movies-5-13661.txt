This is probably the most moving aspiring and most touching, riveting, movie I have ever seen! It's the life of a poor young black woman (Whoopi Goldberg) who's sold off into a marridge where her own kids and husband hate her, but soon this woman makes her own living and makes her own revenge and prosperity. I reccomend this movie to everyone.
