A gory, creepy thriller from the director of Trainspotting. Remarkable acting and frantic cinematography make up for what may lack in terms of plot. Ultimately, this is a fierce critique of the nature of humanity, masked in blood and trauma. If you're looking for more than a mindless action flick, you won't regret seeing this film. But don't see it alone...
