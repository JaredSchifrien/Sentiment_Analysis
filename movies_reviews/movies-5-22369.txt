Even almost 25 years, stil the most scariest space movie ever. the creature bursting out of that man's chest is still the best scene. The music is also very scary. A lot scarier than many modern science fiction and thriller movies. Some scary scenes-the alien derelict ship with the alien pilot skeleton and the egg room, the chest burster scene, the alien killing Brett in the dark cargo hold room, the alien stalking Dallas in the air vent, the alien being on Ripley's shuttle, Ash attacking Ripley, and a deleted scene in which Ripley finds Brett and Dallas cocooned in the cargo room.
