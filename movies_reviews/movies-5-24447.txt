This movie rocks! I enjoy the special effects and characters! Some of the scene in the movie such as the lightning destroying stone buildings in Rome and the microwaves destroying the Golden Gate Bridge are a little far-fetched but this movie is addictive. You can learn about what the inside of our earth looks like by watching this movie.
