This film has a lot of heart. It's a great feeling to cheer for Billy Elliot as he fights for his passion in dance and his need to express it. Jamie Bell gives a fantastic performance as Billy: touching, sensitive, defiant. I loved this film and was very moved by the end. And the music in the film, with lots of tracks by T-Rex, is also superb. A+!
