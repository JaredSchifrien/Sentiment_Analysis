Star Wars fans prepared to be dazzled and blown away by effects, and some insight into the three original star wars, with the awesome music of Darth Vader making one grin cheekily. This Star Wars is visually spectacular and the storyline stays put throughout. It has something for everyone, i.e. A spunky boy for the girls, a little skin for the guys, awesome effects for any movie-lover, talented actors (Christenesen, Jackson and McGregor) and a side of Yoda I'm sure most people thought we would never see. This episode is a roller-coaster ride for the imagination. However, i feel the romance aspect was well-played by our young actors, but in some points you seem to think it's an episode of some dramatic soap opera. Also, both times watching the film i have noticed the start takes you through the narrative (that is, it takes time to tell the story), so the action may not appear straight away, but when it does come you smile from ear to ear. Overall, a fabulous movie with new-comer Christensen setting the mood and pace for an evil Darth Vader.
