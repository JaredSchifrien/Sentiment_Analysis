I loved the movie! It included so many different kinds of feelings. Sometimes you cry, other times laugh, grip on the edge of your chair, smile! I thought the ending fit. It reflected what Noland told his friend after he lost Kelly all over again. The sun will come up in the morning and you never know what the tide might wash up!
