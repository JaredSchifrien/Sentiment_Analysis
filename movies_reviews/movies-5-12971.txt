The movie is actually as good as the novella written by King. I am usually disappointed in film based on a written work, if I have read it. However, Shawshank captured every essence. The acting was so exceptional that the viewer feels more like they are peering into real people's lives rather than watching people act. Uplifting and inspirational. I was with Andy through every step of his journey and truly felt the amazement and beauty of life that he had always known existed.
