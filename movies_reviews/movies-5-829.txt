This movie freaked me out big time. I saw it last night for the second time and it still spooked me. I may not be as observant as other people (I was completely shocked by the ending) therefore, ignorance is bliss because it made it much more thrilling. I agree that it is a drama slash horror with the emotional problems of both Cole and Dr. Crowe but I really thought it was a great psychological thriller as well. The premise and plot were well developed and I did jump a few times (even the second time). You also can't deny that Hayley Joel Osmet gave an excellent performance.
