Utterly fantastic! This great 3D animation cartoon is fully equipt with famous voices, (such as Dave Foley), terrific animation, cute bugs and some great one liners that make it fun and appealing to both adults and children alike. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out. I bought this movie because it was so funny and original and is 100% better than the try-hard Warner Bros movie Antz . It is a heart-warming film, tha teaches us the good things in lfie and is full of adventure and humerous anecdotes throughout.
