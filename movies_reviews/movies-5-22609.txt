Coming from along time reader of the X-men comics, let me say that this film seriously exceeded all expectations. Wolverine was perfect, with one-liners true to his comic book counterpart, although i think that ? would have been slightly better considering that Logan is meant to look slightly older than 30. Not even his healing powers could make him look that young. The weakest link [if there was one] has to be Rogue. Too much of her personality was melded with Jubilees', meaning that her true past from the comic books cant be explored. Also i didnt like the way that original members of the X-men were made to be teenagers. I mean anyone currently up to date with the comics, will agree that ice man is one of the most interesting characters with the expansion of his new powers. and yet here he is all spotty and hormonaly charged hitting on Rogue who is obviously just waiting for Gambit to get a call up. I know that i need to get a life, but i dont care! i'm going to go home and watch the film again on DVD.
