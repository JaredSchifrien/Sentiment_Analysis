Good Lord, help us all. The first movie should NOT have been made, therefore, the sequel was extremely unnecessary and the THIRD one should have been against the law. I believe it was a dreary Sunday afternoon that my husband was channel surfing and stopped on this ridiculous movie. Yes, I watched it..I needed a brain dead day, and this movie fit the bill. I do not need to see My Buddy Dolls doing the deed (very odd scene). Overall, the movie is the worst movie ever made.
