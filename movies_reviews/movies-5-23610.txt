This si sci-fi at its best. You don't have to have huge ugly aliens or White House's being blown up to make a good sci-fi flick. Well, for it to be bankable you need those things but that is beyond the point. Dark City is BRILLIANT. Director Alex Proyas created one of the best sci-fi films ever made.A film that explores the fragility of the human mind, of identity, the mystery of love, and above all the strength of the human spirit and heart. Through all this darkness it is you who can bring about the sun. You have the power within you to change it all. This is a very underrated sleeper that bombed at the box office. I had the pleasure of seeing it while it was still in theaters. Ever since that evening, I have held this beautiful film close to my heart. Its message has helped me to become who I am today. REMARKABLE filmmaking. HIGHLY HIGHLY Recommended. Though not everyone will like this film, I believe any real movie fan with an open and accepting mind will fall in love wwith this milestone in Science Fiction.
