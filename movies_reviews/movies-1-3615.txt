i must admit, im a huge Arnold fan, Predator and Total Recall have to be 2 of the best action movies ever made ( of course total recall greatest sci fi film ever made ). But folks, DONT SEE THIS. It is a disapointment to arnold and he knows it. It may have got 2 thumbs up but they were up their asses at the time...Dont bother with this one.
