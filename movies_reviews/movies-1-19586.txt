I...I just don't understand why anyone would give this over one star. Why people cheered for such an atrocity. Scare factor - 0 Suspence factor - 0 Likeable character factor - 0 bad guy you can at least root for because the charactors and actors all suck so bad and add to the overall poonessity of this peice of teeny bopper bubble gum bullsh*t of a movie factor - 0. Usually if a slasher flick sucks there is at least is a killer to kill off the dorkass teeny kids. In this movie the killer is as big a loser as the kids he's trying to kill! He gets hung up on a fishing net? He kills everyone with such ease but can't even catch Jennifer Love Hewitt on his own friggin boat? AAAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!! This is complete and utter poo! Where are you Michael Myers? Where did you go Leatherface? Where is Norman Bates? These movies are makeing our horror fans stupid! This is not horror! It is marketing! It is makeing money of the naive and makeing fans out of idiots! But who am I to say. It could be somebodies American Beauty or Exorcist. Anyway, Jennifer Love has definatly mastered the art of the sacred push up bra. Lovely clevage dear. Wish I could say the same for the acting. I'd rather watch teen wolf 2. Maybe.
