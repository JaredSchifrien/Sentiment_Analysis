Every year I see this film at least once and it never fails to take my breath away. It is an absolutely wonderful film, flaws and all. Baz Luhrmann has to take credit for the vision that he had and the way he executed it. It was pure genius. But the bulk of my appreciation and admiration goes to Leonardo Dicaprio and Claire Danes were simply riveting as the two star-crossed lovers. Never have I seen such esquisite chemistry between two leads, a chemistry that was so vital to the story and it was there BIG time. On their own, they were pretty great but together they are dynamite. Can't wait till the next time I watch it again.
