Hitchcock was master of presenting the most important scenes and allowing the viewer to form their own opinions. As he did not have to show the murder, all he had to show was the shadows. And by doing this he actually made the scene scarier. There are somethings that will forever remain classics, and Hitchcock's Psycho is one of them.
