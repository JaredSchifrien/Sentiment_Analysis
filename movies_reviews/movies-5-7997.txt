Very funny movie!! Robin Williams was great in it. He was in a role he was perfectly suited for. It was sad and funny at the same time, a movie is rarely like that. Good happy ending as well to boot. The cooking scene where Mrs. Doubtfire orders out food after burning her plastic old lady suit was the funniest scene in the movie.
