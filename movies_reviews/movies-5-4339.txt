i have to give this movie five *s, even though it was fairly disorienting. the characters came through the cgi, but the shading, and the jerky movements always rang artificial to me. i guess i'm just not used to this medium. anyway, it's a good story with an unconventional hero, as i'm sure you've heard, and it's very worth watching. kids will love it, whether they know all the fairy tales that it references or not. my favorite part is the sometimes devilish wit it employs, to show that it has an edge and to keep audience interest at times where other kid movies would sag from pure sugariness. in other words, good enough for adults. a real good time.
