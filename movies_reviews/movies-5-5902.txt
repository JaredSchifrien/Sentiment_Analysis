Although somewhat slow (one of Hitchcock's greatests techniques for creating suspense), VERTIGO is the most humane and extremely personal movie ever made. It took me a few times to truly see the brilliance of this movie, so I wouldn't be surprised if first-time viewers were extremely dissappointed with it. Definately one of the top 5 greatest films of all-time.
