Don't be misled by the other reviewers of this film: THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE WITH ALOT TO SAY ABOUT THE OFFICERS, ENLISTED MEN, AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO WERE TOUCHED BY THE VIETNAM WAR.It is also respectful of our adversaries in Vietnam, the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese, who fought us bravely and also shed their blood in that tragic war.The other films about Vietnam, including The Deer Hunter, Platoon and Apocalypse Now spent most of their conscious effort cinematically defecating on our troops and their purpose in being there -- to prevent the enslavement of the South Vietnamese People. At least We Were Soldiers portrays our troops in a more balanced light, and also shows their incredible bravery which they demonstrated again and again against overwhelming odds. Go see this movie if you're not afraid of what really happened in Vietnam at the Ia Drang Valley.
