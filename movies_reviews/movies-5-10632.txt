It's hard for me to find any flaws with this movie. Gene Hackman steals the show as Royal Tenenbaum - an obnoxious patriarch who is trying to bring his hysterically disfunctional family back together again. The heavyweight cast of Hackman, Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Owen and Luke Wilson, Danny Glover, and Anjelica Huston turn in nearly perfect performances, and Wes Anderson adds the same quirky touches that made Rushmore such an outstanding film. This movie will make you laugh out loud, and may choke you up a little as well. To give you a sense how it was received in the theater where I saw it, most people applauded when it was over. The Royal Tenenbaums is one of the better movies I have seen in the last year or so.
