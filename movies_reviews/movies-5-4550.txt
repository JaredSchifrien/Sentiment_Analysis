This movie is certainly incredible! :) With breathtaking computer animation, The Incredibles continues Pixar's streak of great movies. With an interesting twist on the superhero story, The Incredibles finds people upset with heroes and forces them into hiding. While I don't think this would happen in real life, it allows for some great comedic moments. Even typical family happenings are given a super-powered twist. Things really get cracking when the good vs. evil plot is set into motion. The action sequences are stunning and quite possibly the best CG action scenes ever made. There are also some hilarious references to catch if you enjoy comic books (No capes!) and a great ending. All in all, I must recommend this extremely well-done movie!
