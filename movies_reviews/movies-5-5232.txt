One of Hitchcock's best. This won Best Picture the year it came out. Joan Fontaine plays the woman who marries Laurence Olivier, a man who was once married to a lady named Rebecca. Fontaine is constantly haunted by the many reminders of Rebecca in the mansion called Mandalay. Judith Anderson is awesome as Miss Danvers, the housemaid who adored the late Rebecca. (She later became Dame Judith Anderson, and actually portrayed the Vulcan High Priestess in Star Trek III: The Search For Spock).
