*Giggle* what another fantastic film by the Coen brothers! The main characters work really well together and its such a silly plot. My favourite scene has to be where they go around to the boys house and John Goodman does his You are entering a world of pain and then proceeds to smash up this really nice red sports car and the owner comes out! It is really quirky, but well worth trying to watch.
