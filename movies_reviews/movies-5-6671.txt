Funny and heartwarming, this dramedy was based on the book (which I enjoyed, as well). I like the part where Anne, the oldest daughter, gets daring and cuts her long hair into a shorter 'do (desiring to fit in with the fashion fads of the era), which shocks and angers her dad. I recommend this classic program to people of all ages --it's entertaining and completely guilt-free.
