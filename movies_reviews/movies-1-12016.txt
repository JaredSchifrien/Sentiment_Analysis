I am a huge Adam Sandler fan, which is why I went to see this movie. However, I was terribly disappointed at the gross stupidity of this movie. It was not even one those movies that is so stupid it's funny. The humor was disgusting and definately a poor representation of Adam Sandler's talent as an actor and producer. I would have given this film a rating of 0 if it were an option.
