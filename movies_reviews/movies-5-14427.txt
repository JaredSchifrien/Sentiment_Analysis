I am not a real big fan of people taking History lessons from Hollywood, however, I think this movie is one of the best mediums to teach young westeners that the Holocaust wasn't the only holocaust of the 20th Century. Canadian youth learn about the massacre briefly, too briefly actually, because of Canadian involvement in peacekeeping there. However, I don't know how much young Americans are taught on the subject, and I think that this movie is the best source to get the point across. Not a lot of people saw it, I know it won't win the Oscar for Best Picture, but I wish it would. Not for pretigue, but for recognition, so that more people will go and see it. I haven't seen any of the other movies up for the award (don't really know WHAT movies are up for the award), but I can honestly say that this in one of the best movies I have seen in a while. One of the few movies I don't mind paying 10+ bucks to see in the theater. The only thing I found wrong was Nick Nolte and ambush scene. I felt it was too action-hero like.
