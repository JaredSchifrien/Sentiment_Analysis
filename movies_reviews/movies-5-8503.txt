Kevin Smith's first and to date best film from his View Askewniverse. The film is an incrediblly low budget, black and white breakthrough film the centers on Dante, who is called in to work when he is not schedueled, at the local covinenece store. The film takes place over one work day and we join Dante in a cross roads of sorts in his life. Along the way we meet a list of original and bizarre characters. Jay and Silent Bob make their big screen dabut and have been the only constant in every View Askew film. Veronica, Dante's current squeez who gives more filatio than mos hardened porn starletts. A never ending bombardment of weirdo customers an Ranal (my favorite Smith character ever written next to Brody) Dante's co-worker at the next door video store. Clerk is in my opinion one of the funniestand most honest films ever made. Original and funnier than hell. Clerks is HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY Recommended.
