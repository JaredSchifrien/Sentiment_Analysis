Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey light up the screen in this delightful movie. The Wedding Planner is a fun-loving romantic comedy that's great for all audiences. Jennifer has a great sense of style and she brings it to the movie in full force. She plays Mary and did a wonderful job in her first comedic performance. Matthew is very charming and so funny. He did such a great job playing Steve. These two were perfectly cast for this movie. I've already seen this movie twice and still can't get it off my mind. I definitely will be buying this one when it's on DVD or VHS. Go out and see it. I promise you won't regret it!!
