This was the first movie we watched in my school's film class this year, and I can't argue with its reputation as one of the greatest movies of all time: great performances from the whole cast, an interesting story, memorable characters, dozens of memorable lines, an intelligent and well-written screenplay with an ample amount of witty humor to boot. As the saying goes, They don't make 'em like this anymore, and it's a damn shame they don't.
