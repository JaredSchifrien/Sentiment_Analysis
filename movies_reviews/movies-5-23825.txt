One of my all-time favorites, and like comedian said, not for everyone. I've seen this movie placed in every category from drama to comedy to cult to SF, and even within SF, the experts are hard-pressed to classify it any further. This is one of the darkest of dark comedies, and it makes very many insightful comments on modern society along the way. The proliferation of modern media and the piles of paperwork are especially lambasted here. The setting is a fascinating kind of mixture of every decade of the 20th century, all thoroughly scrambled into one. The tale is reminiscent of 1984 and other classic dystopias, and the dream sequences are as vivid as anything from Alice in Wonderland. And there are all sorts of little touches throughout the movie that viewers can catch the second, third, etc time around. Probably the very best way to experience Brazil is Criterion's 3-DVD set which includes tons of extras and two different versions of the movie! One is a much more complete 142-minute edition for the fans, complete with ambiguous ending. The other is a shorter Love Conquers All version with a happier ending!
