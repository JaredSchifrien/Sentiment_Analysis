We rented this movie last night. Definitely one of the better films I have seen in quite a while. I am surprised it didn't get more media attention..at least not that I remember. Douglas, Maguire, McDormand and Downey Jr. all did an amazing job in forming their characters and drawing in the audience. I disagree with Molfan, I found this film very humorous..maybe because I enjoy dark, dry humor..You couldn't help but laugh at the comedic tragedy of this weekend in the life of this group of people. I am not for killing dogs..but the whole scenario was humorous in a sick way..I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to everyone. As for the ending..I enjoyed the fact that they gave some closure..however, in sticking with the unpredictable plot, they could have ended with him wavering at the top of the stairs..keep you wondering..of course, that may have irritated a lot of people..thus the nice happy ending. GREAT MOVIE!
