The best movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I have seen it over 1000 times (went through 2 vhs copies before I got my dvd). There isn't enough good things I can say about this movie. Instead, I just make people watch it, and I've yet to hear a complaint. I have the scenes, script, soundtrack, and score memorized. It's just such a powerful movie. I've yet to have such a cathartic response with another film as I've had with 'The Crow'. Romantic, violent, wry, heart-wrenching, satisying... one of the greatest films ever made, in my opinion.
