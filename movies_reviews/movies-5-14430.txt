This is a movie you catch for the history lesson, much more than the entertainment value. There's plenty to admire in the movie, though it's heavy subject matter. I'm glad I went last weekend, and felt ashamed I didn't know more about the million people systematically slaughtered during the mid-nineties in Rwanda's Holocaust of sorts. The lesson in the movie is why is makes sense for the UN and its supporting countries to intervene during a major international crisis, which happened too little too late in Rwanda. It's easy to relate to the family that the movie centers around, and seeing all the modern day conveniences in most every scene do much to defeat myths people have of lifestyles in Africa. Big props to the heroic real-life hotel manager who is excellently portrayed by Don Cheadle in the film.
