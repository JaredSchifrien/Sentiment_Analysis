Hilarious! This has to be one of the funniest movies of 2000. Martin Lawrence can still make a seemingly tired old routine (a man in drag) into a winner. Though the laughs and jokes are somewhat crude, they'll leave you red with laughter so long as you have a sense of humour. The storyline of Big Momma's House isn't at all outlandish and further adds to the appeal of Martin's comedic performance. Nia Long also does a pretty good acting job here, playing the daughter who comes home to Big Momma not suspecting that it really is Martin under all that make up.
