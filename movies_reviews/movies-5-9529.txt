That must be one of my favourite english comedies ever. Witty, original, with a perfect screenplay (they made a wonderful use of this lovely sheffield slang), with a few pretty outstanding performances (Mark Addy in particular), good use of kitchy disco music you may start liking after this movie. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
