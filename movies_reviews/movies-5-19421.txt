This is truly the only horror movie to give me nightmares. The most well written, well thought out movie in ages. John Carpenter at his Best. The whole concept of this movie is in itself frightening. To imagine it happening to you would blow most anyone's mind. Casting was excellent and well played. Nothing will ever top this in my book. So few people have seen it, which is really a shame. My brother (musicprof) and I tell everyone we know that they should watch it. Someone should hold a filmfest at Halloween in every town in the country and play this one as the opener. Noone would want to leave there seat for popcorn.
