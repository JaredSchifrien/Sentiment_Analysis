Wow - this movie proves that people do not know what type of movie they are making when they are making it. Much like opening a present, they see it for the first time for what it is when it is done, and opens. Unfortunately this is a large box of doggy doo. I don't usually diss other reviewers, but those rating this highly must be on Costner's payroll, in one of the actors families, or in a mental facility.
