You guys have to remember - Mike Moore is a filmmaker, an artist. Dubya is the President of the United States of America. Some of you think that Moore is distorting the public with this movie? Its a movie! Gee, I really think that Alien vs. Predator is really distorting people's view of the history of the planet! Bullstuff! Of course Dubya didn't go to war for political reasons - they are monetary reasons! The Carlyle Group has $800,000,000,000 invested in the American War Machine...hmmm. Who's in the Carlyle Group? the Suadi Binladen family, Texans+Bushes, Tony Blair...? This is too much! I was phyisically ill watching this movie (not just from seeing Moore on screen, either) but from the civilian causalties in Iraq. Oscar Wilde said,Patriotism is the virtue of the viscous. If you watched this movie and you were not touched deep down by the uncensored brutality of this war - then you are a true patriot!
