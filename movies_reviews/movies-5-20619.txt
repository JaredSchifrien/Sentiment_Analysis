Grease is just one of those movies I can watch over and over again without ever getting bored. Just hearing one of those songs brings a smile to my face. Happy-go-lucky and true to the feeling of high school, this is just pure entertainment. Nothing deep or dramatic or wildly talented, it's meant to be cheesy and silly but most of all, it's just meant to be fun.
