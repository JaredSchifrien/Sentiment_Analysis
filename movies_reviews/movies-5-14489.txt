Almost Famous is the best movie I have seen in the last six months. This movie is strong in every element. The casting was amazing. The film gives a great view of the 70s rock and roll scene through the eyes of a young writer. I found the script very unmanipulated, and I never felt as though I was hit over the head with any point or emotion. I found myself in tears at one point in the movie and I was not sure why. I believe it was the sincerity of the story and the telling of it that moved me to tears. The most memorable moments were not words at all, but instead visual images that contained much power and emotion. I would recomend this film to anyone who can appriate a good story, a good cast, and a heartfelt experience.
