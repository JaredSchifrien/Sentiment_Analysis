No other film defines cinematic splendor and magical possibilities quite like The Wizard of Oz . Whatever all the necessary elements are - and I am sure many would give their eyeteeth to be capable of completely defining them - rarely do they come together quite as distinctly as they did in this case - with just the right cast, story and enchantment to make it timeless! This never-ending success story is one of those extraordinary things you cannot plan, duplicate or mimic. Since its release in 1939, this film has been the source of wonderful childhood memories and has been loved by several generations. Its message is simple - there is no place like home and the people who love you. That point alone makes it easy to see its wide-range and lasting appeal.
