Everybody loves shawshank, it's dificult to see anything beating it for the 'peoples' choice for best film of all time. Brilliant from start to finish. The unfolding scenes from when Andy is sat in the yard talking to Red, just let out from solitary confinement, to the films close are as satisfying to watch as anything in cinema.
