Remarkable in it's pacing and visually stunning, this bridge from FOTR to The King's Return is nothing short of spectacular. Fans of the story may lurch a little regarding the story changes, but PJ has done an admirable job of balancing his love for the story and his genius for making the movie fly. Gollum...well, what can I say? He LIVES! Incredible CGFX in Gollum, Helms Deep, Ents...this is a very rich banquet...enjoy it more than once!
