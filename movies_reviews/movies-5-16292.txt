The Passion explicitly showed the suffering Christ withstood for the sins of man (if you are a believing Christian). The movie is gripping and phenomenally done. I have no idea what Chatholic teaching is but Catholic teaching is such that all mankind bears the burden of His death and at no time does this movie mention Jews whatsoever nor does it attempt to guilt Jews into being Christians (which there are many sects only one being Catholic). The hype is that it's anti-semetic.
