Excellent entertainment value. Still enjoy watching it, though I have seen it many times. Very stylish with a good cast. Gert Forbes isn't one of the better Bond villians, but he is still good. Odd-Job is still scary. Pussy Galore makes most A list actresses today look like cardboard cut-outs in comparism.
