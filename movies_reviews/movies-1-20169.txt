Man... I have never been so let down by a movie. Considering, that I wanted to love this move... since the original Exorcist is my favorite horror flick of all time. I almost gave this movie 2 stars because it did make me laugh in certain supposed scary parts. Before I commented on this, I tried to think of ways to make this at least... at least 2 stars. I just couldn't do it. This was a horrible, boring, dragged out piece of garbage.
