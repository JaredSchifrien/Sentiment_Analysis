An appalling piece of garbage, which I had mercifully forgotten until I saw it listed here. One watching it gets the impression that Pearl Harbor was some kind of spectacular American victory, due to the heroics of a few ace fighter pilots. It was no such thing. And one also gets the impression from the movie that the Doolittle raid was a spectacular success which ravaged Japan's industrial machine: it caused very little damage at all (mainly being a psychological victory). The special effects in the movie are good, as they always are, but the acting is laughable and the contrived romantic parts make any watcher with high standards reach for the vomit-pan. Avoid this deformed turkey, there are plenty of better movies.
