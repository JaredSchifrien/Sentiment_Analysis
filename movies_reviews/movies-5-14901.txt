My favorite movie ever!!! Mel Gibson gives an outstanding performance as Benjamin Martin, a father of seven children, who keeps family top priority in his life. He is from South Carolina, a state which is going to war with the British. Benjamin doesn't want war; he wishes there were some alternative to it. However, he ends up fighting the British, along with his oldest son, Gabriel, to take revenge for the death of Thomas, one of Benjamin's sons. References are made to slaves, i liked the way those conflicts were resolved in the end. Colonel Tavington got what he deserved in the end... I really liked that. The restoration of order taking place was great, when his house was being rebuilt. Overall, an awesome adventure and journey dealing with American History. Packed with great storylines, action and suspence. Rush out and see it.
