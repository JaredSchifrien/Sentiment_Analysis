It's probably one of the only musicals I actually like. It stars Johnny Depp as a very angry self-confessed juvenile delinquent with his friends Milton, Wanda, and Milton's girlfriend Hatchet-Face. Then they befriend an uptight prudish girl named Allison Vernon Williams (Amy Locane). Their lifestyles collide and lots of hysteria and chaos unravels.
