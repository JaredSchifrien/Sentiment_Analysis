Callmetootie is an idiot...ive read too many of her opinions and havent agreed with one. Chris Farley is amazing in this movie. If you cant enjoy it then i really think there is something wrong with you. And David Spade is great. His role is necessary to be the straight man, but he also has the ability to dish out great one-liners.
