I waited to see this film for a whole year, and the director Peter Jackson really made the wait worth its while! So far we've seen how the Ring was found and now we go on to see the journeys and battles of our (now broken)fellowship. The film,as expected, did not include evrything from the novel, but what it did miss out was replaced by the breath taking landscapes and new special effects. The best part was the revealing of Gollum, this character, generated from CGI, was depicted just as i would have imagined whilst reading the books.The voice and looks of gollum was so good that you would believe that ther really was a creature like this! The battle sceens were created by CGI as well and the casting and costumes were perfect. The only thing that didnt seem right was how the movie ended, but it does leave alot for the next movie...i cant wait to see how P.Jackson is going to make the next LOTR instalment even better!!!
