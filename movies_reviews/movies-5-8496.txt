UPDATE: ClassicTVFAN, there is no gas station invovled. It takes place at the Quick Stop market. The appeal lies in the true to life, workaday, reality it presents. Once you have matured and dealt with the public in any way, you will see just how realistic and funny this movie can be.---------------------------------------- CLERKS is the first of the FIVE films in Kevin Smith's hilarius View Askew Askewniverse. The others are MALLRATS, CHASING AMY, DOGMA, and JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK. The original film, shot in black and white, was filmed on location in Leonardo, New Jersey at the very store Smith worked in. It was shot in black and white to save money. And the money to finance the film came from various sources, includeing Smith's Mother's borrowed credit card. The plot follows one day in the life of Dante Randall, a clerk at the Quick Stop Market, and his best friend Randall, who works at the RST video store next door, although he spends more time at the Qucik Stop then at his own store! Dante is subjected to being called in to work on his day off, and hilarity ensues! The day begins badly, with the discovery that the shutters cannot be opened and everything goes downhill from there. He is subjected to a rant about the evils of smoking (given by a gum saleman to increase sales!), crazy customers (including one who smashes eggs!) and the harrasment of the local dope dealers, Jay and Silent Bob, all while trying to find time to straighten out his complicated love life (His ex-girlfriend (whom he is still in love with) is getting married, while his current girlfriend is bugging him to go back to school), finding time to close the store and play hockey (on the roof!), and atending the funeral of an ex-lover. Randall complicates his life by showing up late to open the video store, and by just being Randall. A hectic movie that is surprising amusing. I can highly recomned this movie.
