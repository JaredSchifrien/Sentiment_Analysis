I thought Save the Last Dance was one of the few movies actually worth the $7.50 it costs to go see it! It went way past my expectations for MTV studios, and I thought that the story was very real, something I could really relate to. Julia Stiles is a fresh face among other manufactured actresses and Sean Patrick Thomas is a true talent and a passion. Together with an excellent storyline, Stiles and Thomas made for a great movie!
