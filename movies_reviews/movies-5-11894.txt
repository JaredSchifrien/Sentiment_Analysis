This movie was entirely misunderstood by a lot of critics and most of the public at large. I found it to be a brilliant experiment in acting and use of innovative camera techniques. It isn't a film for the uneducated masses who like Hollywood slop delivered to them in neat little packages. It makes you ponder and listen carefully to what is being shown on screen. It is complex and multi-layered in its approach. The acting of David Hyde Pierce is exquisite and his character is definitely the heart of the piece. Catherine Keener and Mary McCormick are also great in this film. Steven Soderburgh is one of the most talented directors in the business and Full Frontal will some day be recognised as the masterpiece it really is.
