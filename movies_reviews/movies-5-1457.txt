very entertaining. its hard to not pay attention to this movie. i kinda have concern for anyone in a comma now. if you seen it you know what i'm talking about. they went way to far with the blood in this movie. it seems like even a minor papercut in this movie would shoot blood like a fire hose. but thats just my exageration. the action and the fighting in this movie are preety badass.
