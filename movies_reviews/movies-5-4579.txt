The enduring classic tale of the cute little elephant who grows up in the circus, is ridiculed for his huge ears,then learns to fly.The product(even in wartime)of a seemingly more innocent age,it's lost none of its charm,should continue to delight generations to come.The Baby mine sequence,when Dumbo's mother gently cradles him through the bars of the cage in which she's imprisoned, must surely bring a lump to the throat of the most hardened cynic.For me,the most endearing,lovely jewel in the Disney crown.
