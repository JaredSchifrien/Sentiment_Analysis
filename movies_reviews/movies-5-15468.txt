A wonderful film with unforgettable performances by Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn. She definitely deserved her Academy Award for this characterization of the nun who is compelled to feel the anguish of victims and perpetrators alike. Demonstrates that the gray area between right and wrong is large. And I think it makes a compelling case for compassion toward all.
