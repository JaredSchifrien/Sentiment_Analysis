This is the first of the modern Sci-Fi films, but it really isn't about outer space - rather, it's an allegory using the space-man motif to make a universal plea for disarmament -- not a popular message in the Cold War atmosphere of the 1950s. In view of the power of McCarthyism and Hollywood black-listing at that time, it's amazing that this film was released.
