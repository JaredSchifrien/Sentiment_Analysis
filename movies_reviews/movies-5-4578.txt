Very good Disney Movie. Dumbo ends up with huge ears. is treated like an outcast and even humiliated. He makes a friend in Timothy the mouse and is told he can fly if he holds a feather in his trunk. He learns at the end he could really fly on his own. This movie can be a tear jerker. Dumbo is taken from his mother and there is a scene where he is outside his mothers cage and she rocks him to sleep. It is about friendship,and pulling for each other.The cruelty that comes for being different I love at the end that Dumbo is the star and loved by all.A very sweet movie.
