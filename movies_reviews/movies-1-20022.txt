Is this over yet? I thought the first one, maybe two were interesting. I was more interested to find out where Jason came from. But please..haven't we had enough of stupid trollops hanging around in bras and panties in a cabin saying, What's that noise. 'I have a great idea, I will put a rain coat over my scivvies and go trapsing around the pitch black campground with a flashlight that has no batteries and follow that sound of someone screaming and being bludgeoned.' These movies frustrate me more than anything. I find myself screaming, You dumb naked tramp, don't go into the abandaned outhouse, don't you freakin' see the six by six foot pool of blood you are standing in and your boyfriend's head on the stick in front of you?!
