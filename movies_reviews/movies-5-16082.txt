This movie was first class- I loved it! Anyone who hears about this film will shrug it off as a wishy washy child flick , but as soon as they watch it, they will love it! It is a very moving story, almost as moving as Remember the Titans or the Green Mile, in which faith and hope emerge through a child in which everyone refuses to accept. And plus- it was one of the few serious films in which Jim Carrey played.
