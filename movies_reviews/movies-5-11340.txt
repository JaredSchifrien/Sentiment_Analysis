This is the life story of Howard Stern. It is also one very funny movie. FOr those of us who like Howard, it is interesting to see how he worked his way up from obscurity to become the KING OF ALL MEDIA. FOr those of you who do not like Stern, this movie may give you some insight into his unique brand of humour. Great music throught the movie is an added bonous.
