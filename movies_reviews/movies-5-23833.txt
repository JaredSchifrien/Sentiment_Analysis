This would have to be my favourate Star Trek TNG movies. The music, especially when Picard was entering into the nexus was beautiful, and I would love to go into this nexus where all my desires were fulfilled! That movie reminded me of Heaven (the nexus) a bit. Plus the story line was good. The meeting between Picard and Kirk was interesting. At least Kirk could defeat Soren which was good!
