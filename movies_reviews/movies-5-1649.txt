If any film can be credited with bringing back the magic and mysticism of the motion picture within the last few years, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is it. It is very beatuiful, very eloquent. It is respectful when it must be, and it is rough when it must be. The performances are first-class, Ang Lee's direction is definately Oscar-worthy (he should have won, but Soderborgh was tough competition) and it is all-around fantastic. As Joel Siegel put it, One of the greatest movies ever made!
