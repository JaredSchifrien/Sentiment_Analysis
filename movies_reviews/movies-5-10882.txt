**Update 8/10/04: I just saw this movie again 2 nights ago. By the beard of Zeus, it changed my life. Again. *OC: If there was a vendor selling Anchorman the dvd for $75 a pop in the theater lobby I would have picked up two on my way out. In case I lost one. This is top-five comedy quality on an all-time list. I'm not kidding, it's right up there with the likes of Naked Gun, Airplane, and Caddyshack. Ron Bergundy - jazz flutist, great hair, scotch-lover. A force to be reckoned with.
