It was awful they put that brat Jane In there I love Wendy she is sweet but, I hate jane (yuck) then they replaced the cool crocodile with a stupid squid and the story was stupid but, I LOVE the original Peter Pan it's awesome in fact the original one is one of my favorite movies but this Cheapquel stinks!!!
