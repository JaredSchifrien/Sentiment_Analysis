The Wedding Planner was the best movie that I have seen in a really long time! Jennifer Lopez is a fantastic actress in this movie. Matthew McConaughey was also a great actor. The Wedding Planner is a Romantic Comedy and it made me laugh and cry. If you are thinking that this movie is not a chick flick, you're wrong because I watched it with my boyfriend who also loved it. It made me think about my own relationship and it helped so if you are having problems with your relationship, I suggest that you take your boyfriend to see this movie and I am sure that everything will be fine after that. I could see this movie over and over and over again and I can't wait until it comes out on VHS so I can buy it. Instead of watching the Super Bowl on Sunday, I went to see The Wedding Planner and that is something that I will never regret. So go out and see it!!!
