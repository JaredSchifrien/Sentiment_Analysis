Absolutely fantastic. I studied Media at college and developed a taste for foreign films and I had read the critics reviews and it was outstanding. So I went to the cinema and watched. It totally grabbed my attention due to the camerawork and style. The part I love best is where she runs past particular people and you see snapshots of what happen to them in the future and it changes with every senario that happens to Lola. I now have the film on DVD and I highly recommend it.
