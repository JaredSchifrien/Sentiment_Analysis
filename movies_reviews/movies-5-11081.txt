I know, I know many Jim Carrey fans out there are angry about this film because of the dirty stuff, but after watching stuff like South Park and especially The Man Show I'm used to stuff like this by now, and I welcome this side-splitter with open arms. Just brilliant comedy. Besides the REALLY gross parts.
