This movie is AWESOME. Outstanding preformances by John Travolta and Olivia Newton John. These movie is incredibly funny but as a younger child i really hated it. I did not understand Grease at all. That was such a waste. The movie has very catchy tunes. I havent seen it in about a month yet i still find myself humming them on occasion.
