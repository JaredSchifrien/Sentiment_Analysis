Dustin Hoffman brings the house down in this delightful comedy, that paved the way for Mrs. Doubtfire and other crossdressing favorites. A different movie from most other comedies thereby making it deserving of a high rating for individuality if nothing else. Not to mention that it is insanely funny.
