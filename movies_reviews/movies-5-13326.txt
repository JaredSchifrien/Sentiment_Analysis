The cinematography was so realistic, and the action was directed so superbly, that you felt like you were the one who was landing on Omaha Beach. It was packed with action that worked, and the story/plot reached out to the audience. You felt connected to the characters, especially Tom Hanks. The last action scene was too unrealistic.
