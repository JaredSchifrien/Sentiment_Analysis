Uncle Buck is in my opinion among the best of the John Hughes movies. It's a story about a wrong-side-of-the-tracks gambler who has to get to know his upscale brother's family and help them out of a bad situation. Macaulay Culkin and the girl who played his little sister were adorable and funny; Laurie Melcalf as Marcie, the horny neighbor, was priceless; and the mother and older sister added the right amount of tension to make the movie a bit of a character study. If you liked Home Alone and Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, you'll like Uncle Buck.
