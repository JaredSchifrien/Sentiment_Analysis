A nasty movie, and I mean that in a good way. Very well written, filmed and acted, particularly in the supporting cast. Cleans up the real-life Bonnie and Clyde, who were really small-time slack-jawed killers barely out of their teens, and with no more brains than a rabid raccoon, but that's a minor criticism of an otherwise excellent movie.
