The only directorial effort of actor Charles Laughton is a masterpiece. Robert Mitchum gives a daring portrayal of insane, murderous preacher Harry Powell relentlessly hunting two innocent children across the Depression Era Bible Belt to get their father's stolen fortune. Despite the films complete lack of academy award nominations, its photography and music, as well as its directing and acting, are exceptional. This chilling suspense film noir is truly compelling and terrifying.
