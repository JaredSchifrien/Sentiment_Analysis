This movie was completely without merit. From unbelievable plot lines to some of the most authentic 1970 special effects and graphics I've ever seen, this movie had a terrible odor which could not be extinguished. I am utterly amazed that the others rating this movie have managed to rate it so high. The characters are so unbelievably shallow and the plot so predictable, that I found myself laughing as each character was picked off. If you should decide to ignore my warning and watch this movie, be ready to laugh, and keep in mind that the law of energy conservation cannot be upheld by the theory set forth in this movie. I like Vin Diesel, and I know the girls find him hot, but he made a huge mistake when he made this.
