This is a perfect picture. If ever there was a perfect cast, it is in this film. They make the film come alive. A David O. Selnick film which, in my opinion, is his greatest acheivement and Alfred Hitchcock's American directorial debut is an auspicious one! Joan Fontaine deserved Best Actress Oscar for her performance as the Second Mrs. deWinter as did Judith Anderson for Best Supporting Actress for her Mrs. Danvers.
