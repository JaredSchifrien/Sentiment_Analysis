The movie was stellar. Agree with the other respondent, it was Humphrey Bogart's best of many great portrayals. He perfectly conveyed the paranoia, obsessive compulsive behavior, and veiled cowardice of LCDR Phillip Queeg. Incredible casting with Van Johnson (later became the Green Hornet), Fred McMurry (playing a heel), and Jose Ferrer. The book (written by Herman Wouk) is even better. No story captures the responsibility and accountability of a military officer at war better than Caine Mutiny. Read the book, rent the video.
