I love this movie it was everything i ever wanted out of a movie, it had comedy,romance,drama, and a light sence to it that made you want to be in it. Kate Hudson i though never could act, but in this movie her smile and inocence made me think wow. I loved everyone on this movie, even if yo werent supose to, it was just so amazing.
