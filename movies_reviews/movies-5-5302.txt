The perfect movie. Try to see it in a theatre and see the reactions of the other people. I've done this a few times. People unconsciously singing along and recitng dialogue, children staring in amazement. And this film is over 60 years old! The current so-called family movies (especially the Disney tripe) with all their computer effects, stereo and what have you can't hold a candle to the Wizard. Once a year? I could watch it every day!
