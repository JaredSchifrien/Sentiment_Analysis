I remember when I went to see this. People had told me how good it was, but I wasn't expecting very much. After all, it starred Bruce Willis. Boy, was I wrong. This is a great action movie which catipulted Willis from television to the big screen. While parts follow the simple action movie formula (superhero fighting evil), the movie has a good sub-plot surrounding the scumbag television reporter. I also liked the second one, but he probably should have stopped there.
