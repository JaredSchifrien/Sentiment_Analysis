I was dragged to this. . .I had my mind made up before I saw it- PC junk Boy was I wrong. A solid dramatic film based on real events. Hillary Swank (who clearly has left her awful Karate Kid movie behind her) was terrific and believeable. Good film. . .but unpleasant to watch the final violent sequence- be warned.
