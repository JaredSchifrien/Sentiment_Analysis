now me i have never liked the cartoon show that is out on tv but i went to see this movie on my best friends birthday and i thought that it was an awesome movie. I think the only little flaw in the movie was at the end when it turned out to be scrappy doo that is the bad guy. I think that he should not have been the bad guy. That i think is the only flaw in the movie
