One of my all-time faves.Not a wrong note in it! Sellers is absolutely, positively, without a doubt, superb! His RAF officer and Doc Strangelove characters had me rolling! Absolutely great comic timing! You see the beginning of Kubrick's style, with the camera, the backgrounds, the attention to detail. I was in the Air Force in the 90s, and things still haven't changed - there really are nuts like that on base squadrons. I love the message behind the madness. This movie can't be duplicated - it's like Duck Soup meets Catch 22 or something. THe Major Kong / bomb/ penis scene and Strangelove talking about postapocalyptic life are fantastic. His whole hand w/ a mind of its own / ex-Nazi schtick - I just can't speak any higher - true genius. Sellers was a hell of a talent - he wasn't even a comedian by trade!
