HORRIBLE! This was the WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Who were the idiots who came up with the story for this one? The characters are so weak, nobody can possibly give a damn about them. The so-called plot is horrible, the setting never changes, and there is only one action scene in the whole movie. I would've fallen asleep if I didn't have some booty next to me. Keanu or whatever his name is absolutely sucks. No skills. No talent. And what's up with movies nowadays being either too short or too damn long. When I go to the movies, I want to see a solid two-hour movie that doesn't waste my time. This movie is about an hour and a half and I honestly would've been happier throwing up on myself and wiping it up with my hands. If a movie even remotely similar to this ever comes out again, somebody in Hollywood is gonna catch a beat down.
