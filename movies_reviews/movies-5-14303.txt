I first saw this film when my partner brought back a pirate copy from Khazackstan for my 19th and I loved it. At the beginning I thought I was imagining things when an image of Brad Pitt is imposed onto a frame in the film about 3 times. Very clever, you can see the insominia is building up with the main character. It is a very intresting concept and acted out very well.
