I had real reservations about this film. I usually don't enjoy much that Drew Berrymore and Cameron Diaz do. I was totally shocked. This movie absolutely ROCKS. The perfect mix of humor, action, camp, and sex appeal. My wife and I bought it as soon as it came to DVD. We never seem to get tired of watching.
