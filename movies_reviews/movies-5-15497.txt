First thing is first. If u scroll down. hpulba had written a comment saying this movie was underrated. This movie is the highest-selling movie in the US and the world, and won 11 Academy Awards, more than any other movie. So what the hell were you talking about? Second, Robin Hood if you are going to bash a movie by saying dumb dumb and dumber, make sure you spell dumber correctly. This movie was a great movie, acting was kinda shady, but a great movie overall.
