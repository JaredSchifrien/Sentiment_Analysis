I dont care what anyone says this is a great movie!I am a girl loved it, because its got a girl kicking guys butts. Thats one of the many good parts about it. I saw it the Sunday after it came out, I wanna see it again. It is soo good. I mean ya it is corny yes, but thats because it is supposed to be like the video game. Just knowing that excuses its cornyness. This is one of the better new movies. The special effect are just as excellent as the movie. There really is no plot to it, but there is never really a plot to a video game either. And Angelina Jolie, is sooo good. She pulls off the accent being cool at the same time. If you want a great, action packed movie to see, this is the one. This is one of my favorite movies. Tomb Raider RULES! And to all you people who are like, it sux, its bad, well COME ON, get a grip. This movie was made for entertainment to make money. And the reason she is so popular is because she does have big boobs, but that part of it made guys go see pay the money for it. This movie was not made to be a classic film it was made just to make money, DUH HUH. And besides every movie cant be a classic, because if all movies were, then we wouldnt appreciate the ones that deserve to be called classics. Also the music to the movie is great. :) I recomend if you dont like the video game, because apparantly you have more brains than us video game likers, I wouldnt go see this movie.
