I find it interesting that the only people who have commented negatively are a: linguistically challenged, and b: desire more action. Next time rent a playstation game folks. This is one of the top ten movies of the last ten years, and a brilliant adaptation of a complex novel. I think a good case can be made to put this movie in the top hundred all time, maybe top fifty. There are no flaws here.
