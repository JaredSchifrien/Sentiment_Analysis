Again, it's not really a comedy. But it's a great fable about modern politics - specifically the beauty and depravity of human nature amplified through the tempest of politics. As dark as the film seems, its really about mixed motives and the tension between idealism and cynicism, romance and realism, and principle and pragmatism. Its billed as a slam of the Clintons, but actually the portrayals are very humanizing in that there are in fact strong core values obscured by the hypocrisy and corruption. I actually came away liking the Clintons more. Emma Thompson was as usual just dazzling in her versatility, but Travolta really impressed me despite the stereotypical depiction. I actually forgot that I was looking at Travolta, whereas Im usually annoyed with him half way through the film because he normally inserts too much of his own personality into his characters. The supporting cast was superb right down to the minor characters with one or two lines.
