Innocent People were held hostage in a high rise building, and Bruce Willis saves the day. The storyline was easy to follow. The action was top notch even though the movie was made way back. It has lots of good gun fights similar to John Woo films, and Bruce Willis had the tough guy sort of look throughout the whole movie, he was perfect for the role. I would agree that this original one is the best of the trilogy.
