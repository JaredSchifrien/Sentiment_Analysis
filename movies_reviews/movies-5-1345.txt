i would say this movie sparked, or perhaps solidified, a new genre of films, the ultra violence of suburbia. similar to movies before it, clockwork orange, twin peaks, and blue velvet, r-dogs looks at the weird world of suburbia and the violence needed to compete and rise to the top. r-dogs is by far tarantino's best movie. the others ones falling victim more and more to his ego and poor acting ability. pulp fiction was entertaining and decent, but not ground breaking like r-dogs. this movie lays the foundation for many of the better movies of the 1990s. although quite frankly i am sick of them now.
