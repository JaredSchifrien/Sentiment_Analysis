One of the few movies that I love just as much now as I did when I was kid. When I was younger I was captivated by the candy and the mystery of the chocolate factory. As an adult I love this movie because it is absolutely hilarious, the songs are so nutty and memorable and because Gene Wilder was absolutely brilliant playing Willy Wonka. A timeless classic that will be cherished for years to come.
