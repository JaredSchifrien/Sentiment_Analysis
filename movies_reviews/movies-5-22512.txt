Blade Runner is SciFi at it's greatest. This film is dark from the theme to the sets. Incredible, subtle acting on the parts of Harrison Ford, Daryl Hannah, Rutger Hauer and more. This film raises the question, What does it mean to be human? The imagery is beautiful and loaded with symbolism. Despite it's dark tone, it is also touching. Rutger Hauer's last scene in this film is one of the most beautiful, life affriming scenes I've ever seen.
