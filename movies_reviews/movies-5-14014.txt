I loved Good Will Hunting. It was so good. I remember seeing it in the theater right when it came out and wondering who the cute guys were. I usually don't cry in movies and I shed a few tears. I was shocked to hear that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had written the screenplay. It made me like the movie ten times more.
