What a funny movie with so many great and memorable lines and characters. Ted Knight and Rodney Dangerfield are hysterical and Chevy Chase's humor is so dry and understated that you really have to pay close attention to what he is saying to realize how funny the lines are. But it is Bill Murray who steals the movie in many ways. It's a Cinderella story. A former greenskeeper about to become Masters champion.
