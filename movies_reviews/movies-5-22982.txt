very confusing, I had to watch it a bunch of times to get the story line, but once I did I loved this movie. only for smart people. kubrick has a way of doing that. the scariest movie I've ever seen and it wasn't a horror movie. not a feel good movie but I like that, it keeps you thinking(if you have sense enough to stay awake). great though.
