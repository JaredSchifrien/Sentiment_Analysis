Denzel exploded onto the screen. This was an amazing movie. Reading the other comments, I can understand why people pull their hair out, we are all so completely different in our expectations. For those of you who agree with me and loved this movie, Kudos for those of you who thought it was bad, clearly weren't watching the same movie.
