One of my favorite movies of all time, this film noir mystery/action movie could not have been done better. Gabriel Byrne stars very well in this film, but he is also excellently supported by Kevin Spacey, Benicio Del Toro and Kevin Pollack. The plot was very near flawless, and the setting was excellent. The characters, while not being deep, are more than adequate to carry the movie through to its finish, and Bryan Singer did a wonderful job with the direction. While the mystique surrounding this movie may cause a new viewer to predict the ending, now, I found the movie to be unpredictable and brilliantly finished.
