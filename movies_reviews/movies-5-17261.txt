Akira Kurosawa's SEVEN SAMURAI is an inspired epic, a triumph of art, and an unforgettable three-hour ride I will never forget. It is one of the greatest films ever made by any director. I have is movie on DVD and I watch it once every month and found I will never love a movie more then I love Kurosawa's SEVEN SAMURAI. This movie is a must have in your movie collection.
