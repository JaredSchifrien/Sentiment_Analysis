I respectfully disagree with you callmetootie. Moonstruck is one of my all time favorite movies. I like to watch it every once in a while. Its perfect on rainy Saturday afternoons with a big bowl of popcorn. In my opinion both Cher and Cage are among the best actors ever, even in their early days. You need to see Raising Arizona with a young, talented brilliantly funny Nicolas Cage, and Silkwood or Mask with a brilliantly convincing Cher. I did enjoy them both in Moonstruck and thought their chemistry, albeit offbeat, was definately there, and realistic. As for Cage looking horrible-- Never--. He's not the typical Hollywood gorgeous leading man type, but he's great-looking in a realistic, manly rugged way that many women find appealing. And finally, I must say that the acting of Cage and Cher as well as the rest of the cast was suberb and everyone was believable as a Brooklyn family of Italian heritage.
