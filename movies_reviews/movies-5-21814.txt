This was truely better by far than the first film (FOTR), and I ve (only) seen it three time (till now). This film shows every character just as much as an other. Gollum was made brilliant, and sometimes one can t even tell to a 100% that he is animated, for instance as Gollum tried to struggle Sam as he first tried to steal the Ring from Frodo. It really, rellay is worth watchin (at least two times, incase you didn t really get the hang of it the first time). The best film ever.!.
