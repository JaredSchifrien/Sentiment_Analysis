Ben Stiller's best movie I think, I like it because it is so stupid and it relly makes fun of the fashion industry which in itself is a big joke. There are a lot of celebrity cameos as well. its funny because the guy has the same face for every single modelling shoot, and then the face he has been working on for years is also the same pose!! ben stiller's entire family works on the film (wife, dad, and mom) and i had to have laughed the entire way through, every time i watch it!
