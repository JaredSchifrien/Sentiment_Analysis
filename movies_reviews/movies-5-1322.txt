KB PT 2 was great. But not as great as PT 1, which I put in my all-time Top-10. The first had a bit more action (The Bride's battle with the Crazy 88s was the greatest fight scene I ever scene in cinema). Further, the music was far superior. I did not think it was possible, but there was a 3-minute stretch where my eyelids started to get a bit heavy. On the positive side, the blood and cursing in Part 1 was a bit over the top; I actually think I could get my wife to see part 2. I also loked the film noir treatment in Part 2. Finally, I have always admired David Carradine and he does not disappoint. One thing I'll say, Uma Thurman was impressive both in acting and her mastery of the martial arts. Can you imagine Julia Roberts as the Bride (I can't do that. Where's my cigarettes???!!) Ms. Thurman deserves an Oscar Nomination. Is Ethan Hawke out of his gourd to fool around on her. Kill Bill 1 and 2 were great cinema. Loved it!!!!
