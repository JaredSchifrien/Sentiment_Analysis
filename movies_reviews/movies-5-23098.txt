I saw this movie three days ofter the release on May 19, 1999, It blew me away. I went home after and the next day I couldn't help but tell everyone how great this movie was. All of the acting by Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, and Rey Park gave you a good sense on how the surroundings should interact with the actors. Desert scenes with old faces, (Liam Neeson). That's how a movie should work. The fight scenes with Darth Maul and his Dual-Bladed Lightsaber versus Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, prompted me to go again. The music was excellent, it gave you a good feeling for the action. The best of the 4 Star Wars movies.
