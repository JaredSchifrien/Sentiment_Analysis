The best of the Farrelly brothers movies (tho Kingpins was surprisingly good too), because the lead characters are so fun to root for. They get points for having Jonathan Richman doing the music interludes, and extra points for writing a movie that's got the same spirit as Jonathan Richman's great 1983 album, Jonathan Sings!
