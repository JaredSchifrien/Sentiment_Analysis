Spielberg's epic masterpiece about one man's discovery of his conscience amid the horrors of the Holocaust. Filmed in B/W to evoke the contemporary films and newsreels of the day, Schindler's List immerses the viewer in the Holocaust experience. Unrelentingly brutal, the camera never flinches as the Nazis demonstrate evil on every scale. Watching this film would be a depressing experience, were it not for the final scenes which movingly portray Oskar Schindler's magnificent legacy. Superb performances by Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes, combined with camera work that will be studied in film classes for years to come.
