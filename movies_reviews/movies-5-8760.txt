Recently saw this at a friends house. I am not a big fan of Adam Sandler, so I wasn't expecting much. BUt I was wrong. This movie is darned entertaining and interesting to watch. Drew is always cute, but in this one she is actualy charming. It's a fresh story and highly enjoyable. IJR says check it out!
