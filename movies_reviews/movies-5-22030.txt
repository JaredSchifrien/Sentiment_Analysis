I have always been a fan of the Alien saga and the second movie is simply wonderful. I was captivated by the first one and simply stunned by the second. I usually despise sequels, but this movie drew me in and held me tight to the very end. Its my favorite, anyway. The traditional look of the aliens is held tightly throughout the movie and the new cast was wonderfully selected. I was also glad to know they kept the character Ripley, who single handedly gave the move a kick butt feel. Especially at the end, which I wont spoil for all who havent seen the movie. Anyway, this is most definitely a head turner that should appeal to any fan of the first movie, or to anyone who can truly appreciate a good thrill ride of a motion picture.
