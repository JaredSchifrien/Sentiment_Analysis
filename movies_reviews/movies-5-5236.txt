One of the most beloved movies of our time, and rightly so. Growing up I always anticipated an airing of The Wizard of Oz on tv. What a treat it was, to be taken to OZ, to escape from the real world, and be apart of something so fantastic and beautiful. Its sometimes hard for me to think that Shirley Temple was actually considered first and foremost for the film, as Dorthy is supposed to be just a Child. I doubt the movie would be the classic it is today, without Garlands brilliance, and amazing voice. Somewhere over the Rainbow, strikes a cord to all whom listen, and its probably the single most definitive score in Cinema history. A tale of 4 wayword souls, on a journey to become "complete" find along the way that they didnt need anything to prove their worth, it was inside them all along. And our beloved Dorothy, finds that, through all of lifes struggles, what matters in the end, are those whom we love and love us, and indeed there is no place like home'
