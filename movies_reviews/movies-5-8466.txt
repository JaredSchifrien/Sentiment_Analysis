This is probably one of the greatest comedies ever! You have to watch it more than once to catch everything, but once you get it all, it is absolutely a riot! I honestly laugh at every other scene in this movie. Mike Myers does a fantastic job playing Austin, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard. Mini-Me was a hilarious addition! And Scott Evil and Frau and Number 2 are just as funny. And Heather Graham is pretty easy on the eyes too. I guess this movie is so cool because there are so many quotable quotes in it...two thumbs way up!
