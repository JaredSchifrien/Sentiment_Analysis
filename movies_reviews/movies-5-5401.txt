When small-town denizen George Bailey (James Stewart) wishes out loud that he'd never been born, his guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers) shows him how his idyllic home town of Bedford Falls would have been without him. This perennial Christman classic works so well because it plumbs the very depths of despair before pulling out all the emotional stops for the desperately happy ending ( I never knew I had so many friends wails George). This is a beautiful and heartwarming tale that is an absolute must-see. Summary: A BRILLIANT AND BEAUTIFUL CHRISTMAS CLASSIC.
