What a very romantic and very lovely movie. The girl lead sure needed a reality check. I felt for the boy lead and he sure had a loving heart. I wish there not so many girls in the world who was like the lead girl from this movie. THe movie was happy, sad and very romantic all in one great package! I reccomend movie for anyone who is romantically in love or ever has been in love!
