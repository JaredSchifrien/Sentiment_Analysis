I am not a particular fan of Tom Hanks, but I have to say he really impressed me in this one.That giggle was brilliant,I thought I'd die laughing.I had no idea that this was a remake, but no matter how good the original was, this version certainly can match it.The Coens are great.Of course, it is not the traditional Hollywood comedy, but thats whats so great about it.Wayans was very criticised, I really dont understand why, I thought he was excellent.The scene when he remembers his childhood is even worthy of Quentin Tarantino.I enjoyed this film a lot.
