Obviously Kevin Smith had something personal to say. And this movie is a perfect thing to say. Though vulgar and sarcastic (love that stuff) it is totally real. These are just everyday people. Though not many lesbians would like Ben Affleck, I was actually in there for Holden McNeil. And lets us not forget Hooper-X. The black man IS God. And last but also the best... guess it yet Thorne? BANKY! Banky F@%#$ % Edwards! Jason Lee once again gives a dynamic performance. That's why he's my hero. And Ben Affleck is not. Oh, and the Jay and Silent Bob once again save the day with weed and wisdom is totally great. Aside from the fact that Holden screws everything up, it's still a good movie. And it WAS NOT Renee Zelweger HughJackman's mate ... it was JOEY LAUREN ADAMS. Moron. So I'll leave you with this.. A four lane road. in the canter is a crisp $100 bill. Four people are at each end of the road. A male affectionate lesbian, an angry as f@$# man hating dyke, santa, and the easter bunny... Who'll reach the $100 bill first? The dyke? Correct. And do you know why?...
