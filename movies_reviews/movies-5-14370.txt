well what to say... do i give this movie a high rating becasuse it effected me so? or do i give it a low rating because it didn't effect me in a nice way? do i give it a high rating becase it changed me --in a blunt painful way--for the better? or a low rating because i didn't feel good about the fact that the whole fcking movie was about drug addiction and the fact that drug (andother) addictions don't usually end happily? Hmmm... this is a dilemma... i'm just really not sure.. i mean, i like puppy dogs, and there were none... that's a minus.. also i enjoy chocolate sundae's with peanuts on top, and i think the best i got was a shared icecream cone during the summer segment-- also the whole summer fall winter thing was stupid, becasue who wants to be left off in the middle of the cold winter! what happened to spring huh? i like spring, and the blooming of flowers like everyone else! everyone likes flowers!!!!! and yes, todd, i also agree with your point about nudity-- it would have been more than appropriate for what's her name to have gotten naked-- and ENJOYED it for god's sakes-- i mean c'mon, i agree, she's a really hot girl, so what's the problem? hot girl should = sexy nudity scenes right? of course it should! is there some piece of the equation im missing?? seems fairly simple to me! i mean if you think about it, if she would have gotten really sexy at that part where she has to go dance for all those old drunk men and stick that petrolem jelly dildo up her but because she has nothing left but drugs in her life and knows her boyfirend is as hopelessly addicted as she is and can't come back for the same reason-- she might have gotten even more money and drugs-- i mean if she wouldn't have been so emotional about the danm thing she could have made an even nicer profit and enjoyed herself at the same time! golly, that director, and that writer man, sure are missing some common sense!!!
