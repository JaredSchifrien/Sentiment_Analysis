An emotional, moving film with a superb performance by Tom Hanks as a gay lawyer with AIDS. I loved the way that the movie brought rebuke and scorn to the ignorant homophobics and the damage they can cause to the emotional systems of homosexuals (and some heterosexuals). Throughout the entire movie, I was rooting for Tom Hanks' character to win the fight. A must-see film for everyone, especially the homophobics; a good deal of them need to realize that what they do and say to gays is a mental stab in the back. I can see why Tom Hanks won an Oscar for his performance...one of my all-time favorite movies. Take care, everyone!
