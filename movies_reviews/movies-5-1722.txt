Finally, a war movie that isn't based on vietnam and back. This has the usual flash and camera gloss that Jerry Bruckheimer brings to all his films. However, the movie appears to have credable acting by the cast thanks to the vision of acclaimed director Ridely Scott. This movie is not for the weak at heart. No gory detail was left out. Then again, whoever said war was supposed to be all glamorous and pretty. If anyone still holds that opinion, this movie will make them change their minds.
