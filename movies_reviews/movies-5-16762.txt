Taliesin Jones movie was a pleasant surprise! I was totally engrossed in the story line and the acting was convincing and sincere! Taliesin Jones movie deserves better publicity so that more people experience this journey of life from the perspective of the heart of a child, real, true, full of joy, heartache,compasion,adventure, and surprises. Like life is, but with also showing us a path to hope. Great movie!!!
