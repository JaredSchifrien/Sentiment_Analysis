Don't even bother with the inferior (and unecessary) 1998 Psycho remake with Anne Heche and Vince Vaughan. The 1960 original shot in black and white remains a testament to the cinematic genius of director Alfred Hitchcock. That shot of Janet Leigh's staring dead eye after the shower scene still gives me jitters! Just don't expect a visit by Freddy Kruger if you haven't seen Psycho already. The only startling scene her is where Janet Leigh's character is murdered by Norman Bates. The rest of the movie is entirely predictable but is well-written and acted.
