this movie is great. They mix honor, heroism, action, drama, and suspense together and get a full dose of what is known a gladiator. IT also gives you a good look at how fast someone back then can be so great, then so bad, then defy and emporer. That day when a gladiator could become more powerful than he emporer of rome. Some of them came for pride, some came for glory, he came for revenge. it also uses great quotes, A man once told me, death smiles at us all, and the only thing we can do is smile back. Crowe smiles
