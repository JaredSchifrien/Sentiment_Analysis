One of the best movies I ve ever seen! I cried twice, I doesn t often cry when I see a movie (OK, when I was little yes, but not in an age of 17)! I also liked the future design, all thought I thought some things was a little unrealistic (like flying cars...what I liked was the clothes, the arcitecture, the human realations... Ojal las proximas generaciones tienen tan bueno gusto! Really fantastic playing from a lot of actors actrisses, not only Robin Williams! :-)) (from a person that usually hates sci-fi)
