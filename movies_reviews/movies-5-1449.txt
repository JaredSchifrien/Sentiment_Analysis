Better than Vol. 2 (which, by the way was outstanding), Kill Bill: Volume 1 has the following superlatives -- 1) Best Martial Arts Flick ever; 2) Best homage to the 1970s ever. More obscure references [to that decade] than a 5-hour Dennis Miller rant; 3) Best Musical Soundtrack ever; 4) Best Girlpower Flick ever (My, my, how Uma has evolved since playing the helpless femme in Dangerous Liaisons); 5) While I think Tarantino is an outright jackass ( particularly by giving fathead turncoat Moore the Palm D'Or), you must marvel at his masterful directorial skills and cinematography; 6) Most violent film I ever saw (though most of the bloodshed is in the Roadrunner vs. Wile E. Coyote variety).
