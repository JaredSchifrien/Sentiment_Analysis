This movie made my mother feel motion sickness! It was awesome, as the Space Shuttle journeyed through space the stars seemed to pass right by us. It felt like we were moving through space, especially when we were in the Space Station and we turned about like the cameras. But the most awesome thing was looking at the Earth from space. It was just so huge, that was the closest I would ever get to seeing the whole world from that point of view. It was breathtaking. Plus the music that is played or not; even the silence in that movie made a powerful impression.
