I thought the first episode was bad, but this one is so much worse. The one good thing about this one is that we see very little of Jar Jar. Anakin is a whole lot older now and start becoming a bit rebellious. I'm sorry but Hayden Christiansen just doesn't seem like the right person to do the job. I thought his acting was horrible - he seemed to be about as competent as a 7th grader putting on a middle school play. The storyline was pathetic if you ask me. Everything happens way too fast, it's as if nothing develops. Jango Fett's involvement in this movie seems unecessary to me as well. There's a lot of action but aside from Yoda's lightsaber scene, none of it was nearly as good as it could've been. The Clone Wars is a really cool concept that could've made a great movie, but as with the Phantom Menace, Lucas really mucked it up.
