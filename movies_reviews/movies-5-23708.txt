Nemesis epitomizes how a Trek movie should be! Starting off with the classic Star Trek The Next Generation theme against a background of moving stars, you know you are in for a great motion picture! The special effects are awesome and even beat the ones found in First Contact and Insurrection. The awesome cast of actors could show Tom Cruise, Vin Diesel and other overrated dramatic actors a good lesson in how to act. The plot is great and has a lot of mind games, just as a Trek plot should. There are some AWESOME touches of continuity: from previous events, characters from Deep Space Nine and Voyager (!!!!), old friends dropping by, other alien races from past adventures and more. The action sequences are so much better than James Bond, XXX, Mission Impossible and others that its not even funny. Rivaling Wrath of Khan and First Contact for best Trek movie ever, I gladly give Nemesis five out of five stars!!
