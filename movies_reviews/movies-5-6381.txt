One of my favorite movies because it's set in Bella Otalia. Also, the two main characters being, Hepburn and Peck perfectly fit the stereotype of Americans in Europe in the fifties. The movie shows several famous Roman buildings and monuments and gives a little insight into the life of Europe after the war.
