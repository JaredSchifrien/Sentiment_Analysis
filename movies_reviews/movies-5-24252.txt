Absolutly breathtakingly brilliant. A strange and dark science fiction nightmare Cronenberg style. Utterly confusing and down right creepy as hell, this movie will intrigue, stun, disgust and leave you wondering What the hell is th new flesh? Along the lines of David Lynch, who leaves you to answer the questions, Videodrome is an honest to God modern masterpiece of contemporary science fiction. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!
