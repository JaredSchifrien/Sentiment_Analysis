An outstanding movie with some of the best acting performances I have seen in years. Russell Crowe is the best actor of his generation. Whenever I see a Russell Crowe movie, I am always drawn into the movie and soon forget I'm watching an actor portraying a role in a movie. (As a comparison, if I watch a Tom Cruise movie, I never forget for a second that it's Tom Cruise on the screen. A huge difference in talent). This will go down as one of the best boxing movie of all time and I think it's Russell Crowe's greatest performance.
