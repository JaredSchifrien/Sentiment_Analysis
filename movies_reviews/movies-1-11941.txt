Third-rate remake of a truly great original movie. Tom Hanks put in his usual unconvincing performance, and in this case, that bogus Southern accent he tortured the audience with was really annoying. Crass, broad, vulgar attempt at humor. Peter Sellers and Alec Guinness must be thrashing about wildly in their tombs.
