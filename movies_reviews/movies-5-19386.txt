I really enjoyed this movie. The casting of Willem Dafoe as the hungry Max Shrek was absolutely inspired. I though he was perfect in every movement, every word. Shadow of the Vampire had it's share of horror and comedy (yet another inspired casting choice in giving Eddie Izzard a supporting role) and balanced them together very complimentarily(is that a word? oh well. is now.) John Malkovich, too, a very often annoying actor was devoid of that overly enunicated type of acting he seems to favor, which made him all the more entertaining to watch. Catherine McCormack was almost unrecognizable as the doomed heroine from her 'Dangerous Beauty' days. All in all, this film was entertaining and informative, not to mention clever and intelligent. A must see.
