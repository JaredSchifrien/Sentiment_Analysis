I am a BIG sci-fi lover so Alien immediately drew me in. With an awesome cast and a VERY memorable main character (the alien that is) this movie a veritable thrill ride. The action seldom takes a stop as Ripley, the main human character, is forced to save herself, her crew, and her cat. The wonderfully done alien in the movie is undoubtedly the most notable feature in this picture, as it tries to kill off each of the crewmembers. The thing I probable like the most about this movie is what I like about most movies like JAWS and Predator. That would be the fact that you dont see much of the monster till near the end. To me, constantly seeing the thing your running from just makes the sense of wonder leave the movie entirely. I have always loved the Alien saga, and the fist of the bunch is most defiantly a great one. I highly recommend this movie to all sci-fi lovers.
