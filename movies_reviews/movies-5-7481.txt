One of the best comedies I've seen in a long time. Pesci is great, but my hat is really off to Marisa Tomei. The New York/Brooklyn accents are superb, and just what is called for in this movie. It is great to watch Fred Gwynne doing something other than Herman Munster - and he does it very well indeed. Grits? What is a grit? is only one of the tremendous lines in this movie. I agree with LanceR abut the porch scene being hilarious. Another favorite of mine is Marisa Tomei talking about the poor little dee-uh. If you have not yet seen this movie, rent the video or DVD and watch it. Guaranteed to brighten your day if you're feeling down.
