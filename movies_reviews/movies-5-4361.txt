This is a very good movie with very meaningful morals I am glad they covered. It covers the meaning of freindship and what true beauty is. It also gets the point across that Disney movies are lame. Shrek has enough crassness to be concedered modern, but also has enough wonderful messages to convey and original ways to convey them that it is ahead of its time. Remember Beauty and the Beast? How the Beast turned into a handsome (By most peoples standards) at the end? Expect none of that in this film. Love can come from inside from your heart and it doesn't matter what the other person looks like. This film actually made me tear up in a couple spots. I also laughed my arse off in some parts.Alot of parts come to think of it. This movie is great for all ages. And I mean that. I think some jokes could be over some kids heads. But you know youth today. They have all that crap on T.V. and porn on the internet, I am sure they'll get most of them. A great film about the power of love and friendship. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Good date movie.
