What happened to character development? I found this film to be an empty waste of my time. Walberg was OK, Bonham-Carter was great considering her beauty was smothered by the silly monkey costume. I just didn't buy it. It seemed to me that the assumption was made that the apes would follow the path of human development but would just retain some of their more hostile animal traits. I felt like the apes got ripped off here but I guess I was the one that got ripped off for shelling out 5.75 for this pitiful excuse for a film.
