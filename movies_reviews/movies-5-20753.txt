Dammit but I love this movie. This classic stage-to screen flick starting the casted-to-perfection Tim Curry as Dr. Frank N. Furter is absolutely fabulous. Being as odd and eccentric as it is, it may not be for everyone, but those with a taste for dark comedy and the macabre will delight in this story of two innocent young lovebirds (again, inspired casting of Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick as Janet and Brad, respectively) who, on a dark rainy night, break down and stumble upon a castle out in the middle of nowhere. As they go in to use the phone, they find themselves in the middle of a celebration for the aformention Dr. and his unveiling of Rocky, the 'perfect' man that he created. The movie just gets weirder and weirder as we find the doctor is a (sweet) transvestite with a bit of a temper. All the while, the cast sings a variety of classic songs such as sweet transvestite , dammit, Janet time warp , etc. I would recommend this cult classic as highly as one can. Watch and enjoy. I know you shiver with antici.....pation.
