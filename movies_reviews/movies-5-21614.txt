Wow, what a cinematic triumph and what an artistic marvel ! Such great footage, close-ups and the make-up, unbelievable ! Especially Frodo with his cute nose ! No wonder this masterpiece of the big screen claimed all those prestigious awards at the Oscars. The customs and dialogue were so inspiring to me that, even though I've read the book dozens of times already, I've had to go back and read some passages all over again (even if I can't take magic mushrooms at the same time anymore). I think my all-time favorite part of the story is when the cave troll chases Frodo around the rock. I only wish we could see that magnificient creature in Two Towers (maybe if he turns into Treebeard, after first being crazed by the supernatural whispers of the ring ?). Another truly classic episode is when the bridge of Khazad-dum collapses over and over again. There, the movie really captured the essence of Tolkien's epic text. I will admit that one thing which did bug me a bit about the book was all the poetry. Just too long-winded and confusing, especially the poems about kings being recrowned and broken blades renewed. They were unnecessary to the plot of the story, and Peter Jackson really showed his genius in editing them out.
