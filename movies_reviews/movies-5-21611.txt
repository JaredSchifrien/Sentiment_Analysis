Probably the greatest fantasy movie ever filmed. Tolkein's magical world is re-created with amazing accuracy, suitable for those who have read his trilogy, as well as for those who have no knowlege of this master writer at all.Its themes and ideas embrace the best of mankind while simultaneosly showing the corrosive effect of evil on the story's antagnonists.I envy those who have't already seen this film: what a wonderful treat awaits them.
