Well, since I suggested this film, I suppose I'd better write a comment. Strange Days (if you haven't heard of it) stars Ralph Feinnes, Juliette Lewis and Angela Bassett. It is set in LA during the final days of 1999. It centers around Lenny (Fiennes) who sells 'clips' (people put an electrical device on their head called a SQUID and it records images and emotions). He's still in love with his ex Faith (Lewis) who is in a nasty situation with her record company owner boyfriend Milo. Then the plot gets thicker.... I won't tell you the rest because it'll ruin it. This film is quite dark and has a superb soundtrack with Skunk Anansie, Juliette Lewis (yes the girl can really sing) and others. It has very moving scenes and concepts that will leave you gobsmacked. The ending is so wonderful, it warms your heart - and the end credits have great b/w stills from the film. If you haven't seen it I suggest you do, you won't regret it. (I hope)
