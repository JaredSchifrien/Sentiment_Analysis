Suffer..Suffer...! God it got to the point where I was literally squirming in my seat...! Enough is enough...! It showed much intelligence in a city boy turned primal man on a deserted island however. Tom Hanks surprized me on this a bunch...! Didn't even begin to think a dude like he could handle it. The relationship he had going was so good in the movie. And even tho it required tremendous strength on Tom's part to do as he did towards the end....that really pissed me off to see her where she ended up and in doing so put Tom after all he'd been through. The ending really bozzled me......a bunch!
