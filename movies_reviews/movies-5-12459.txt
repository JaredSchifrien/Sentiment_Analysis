Concur with Seraph. This is one of the better suspense movies I've seen in a while. I'll cite a few reasons why I liked this movie: 1) A very good plot. It's got all that New Orleans' Hoodoo/Voodoo interacial gobbledygook which is always good for a scare (Much more effective than the Lamo "Haunted Mansion" Disney offering). They do a great job in tricking the viewer into thinking who the "whodunit" is; but no one suspects what really transpires in the very creative ending. 2) Great locales. Pre-Katrina New Orleans and neighboring Terrebonne Parish are depicted. Even before the hurricanes hit, you get the idea that this is a part of the country where you are better off having gills and an umbrella strapped to your head. I recall on a Charleston SC Ghost Walk, the tour guide commenting Charleston ranks a distant second to New Orleans in ghost sightings. One look at this movie and I'm reminded of Dan Aykroyd's comment, "We're in Ghost Central Station." It is one of the more effective uses of location to create a haunting mood since Philadelphia and "The Sixth Sense." 3) Kate Hudson is hot and a pretty good actress to boot(y). You'll get to see her in a few panty-clad scenes, tight-jeans scenes, and a Damsel-in-Distress scene.
