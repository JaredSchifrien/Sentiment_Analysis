Engaging, funny, sad, dealing well in both fantasy and reality, 'Forest Gump' is movie entertainment at its very best. I would even go as far as to say that it's the best film produced since the golden age of Hollywood. Tom Hanks is one of the best actors of our time who has given us one of the most memorable characters on film. I'm glad I wasn't the only one able to see his talent since way back in the 'Bosom Buddies' days and hope he goes on to make more great movies with great heart like 'Forest'.
