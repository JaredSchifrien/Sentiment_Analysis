One of the best movies I've seen in theatres in a long time. As I tell everyone who asks me, it's the best movie I've seen in theatres all year. You don't need to see the first to like this one, though I'd seen X-Men 1 in theatres too and liked it quite a bit, and this one is actually better than the first, at least in my opinion.
