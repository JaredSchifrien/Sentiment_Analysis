I had to be dragged into the theater to see this one. I wasn't expecting a cinematic masterpiece or anything, but did it HAVE to be that painfully bad? The first one was better (and that's not saying much, obviously). The jokes were lame (again, not that I was expecting much), the storyline was terrible, it was just BAD. The movie lives up to its title all right, so I guess it's not false advertising, at least.
