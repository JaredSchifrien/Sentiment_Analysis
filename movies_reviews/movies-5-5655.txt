Bogart and Hepburn battle for survival against the sweep of a broader, encompassing world war. Hepburn's character is perfectly in-tune with the situation, which may be unappreciated by younger viewers who do not understand that people were often that way in reality. Bogart is crusty to perfection, only learning reluctantly that Hepburn can make a real contribution to his chances of survival and his life.
