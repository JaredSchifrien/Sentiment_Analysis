I would've been really depressed after seeing this movie if I actually cared. Probably someone born after 1985 might think this is high art, since crappy movies were the norm by then, but thinking it don't make it so. Lucas should give the money back for this one.Did noone see the stark resemblance in plot to the first movie? I'm supposed to believe a 6-year old can fight in a space battle? You mean Darth Vader grown up and chasing Luke down the Death Star trench doesn't have a flash of deja vu and say, hmm.. maybe I'm not gonna win this after all...this reminds me of when I was a kid... Darth Maul came and went, but Jar Jar wouldn't go away. I couldn't make heads or tails out of the murky political subplot. It sucked even more than Howard the Duck
