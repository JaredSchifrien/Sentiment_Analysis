Yes, I give it a five. It is one of those movies for all time. Does it stand the test of time? I believe so simply because of it's message. Michael Knight, probably best known from the tv show Houston Knights, takes the lead role and does an adequate job. I really enjoyed the way the movie showed each of the characters struggles with not only the rival gangs but their own emotions. It relays a good sting together to survive kind of message.
