Ben Hur was a revolutionary movie with respect to special effects featured in it. Most notably, the sea battle, and the warrior cart scenes are outstanding. Of course, considered from our turn of the century point of view, those effects may seem 'primative' (bad word) but the movie as a whole counts as one of the most significant in movie history. Also by depicting Biblical events and the historical surroundings in a very attractive way.
