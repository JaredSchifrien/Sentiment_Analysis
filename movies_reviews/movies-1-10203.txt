My husband and best friend dragged me out to this movie, thinking that this was all about T&A, but it was something WORSE--it was a thinly-veiled chick flick! (Though, it was kinda amusing to see their reactions after the movie, it made it almost worth sitting through it). It's one of those little girl in a big town trying to make it on her own kind of movies, and if you like that kind of thing, then go for it. I'll pass, though.
