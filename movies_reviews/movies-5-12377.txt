Definitely worth seeing. Finally, a "Family" flick that doesn't put me to sleep. Like LOTR, it took a long time before film technology could do justice to it. It's a very imaginative story tht allows people to choose how much symbolism is involved. Supposedly, author C. S. Lewis based the hero (a lion) on a certain figure prominently featured in the New Testament. The acting was decent. I loved Tilda Swinton in "The Deep End." She plays a very BEYOTCHEE Witch with perpetual Bad Hair Days, which seems to put her in a murderous rage all the time. She does a decent job with her swordplay -- even with her skinny little arms. As I always say, the mark of a great actress is her ability to wield swords or to launch kicks. Take Julia Roberts or Jennifer Aniston, overated damsels; the only thing tough they can do is pout while smoking a cigarette.
