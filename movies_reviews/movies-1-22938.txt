Terrible Terrible, o se habla Espa ol, Terrible. What kind of a name for a movie is that, Clockwork Orange. If I went to a movie theater watching this movie, I'd have to wear a paper bag over my head. Nothing about this movie was interesting. I fell asleep, even though the theater was playing in surround sound.
