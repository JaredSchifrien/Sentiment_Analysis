at first i wasn't even sure why i liked this movie. it didn't have any moral journey that i could see, except for maybe maxine's. but for such a weird movie it was refreshingly unique and it got my mental wheels spinning. and the characters were so well written - they all had endearing qualities as well as tragic flaws. i thought the lack of an explanation for the portal would deter my opinion, but it didn't. it was a fun and imaginitve ride without being too dark or too cheesey. it did seem to give a sympathy-provoking light to same-sex intimacy, though. but then, the only scene that never fails to make me laugh is when that fan approaches malkovich and ironically says how much he appreciates retards being portrayed so compassionately on the big screen .
