I liked both versions, although I found the 90s version to be much darker. Judas goes to Heaven in the original, but goes to Hell in the newer version. All of the older version was filmed outdoors, and all of the newer version was filmed indoors. They Godly chorus was altered in the newer version to be more of Satan's chorus ("Good old Judas, poor old Judas" carries different meaning for instance). It's based on the book of John, which ironically is the most anti-Jewish of the Gospels (refers to the bad guys as "the Jews" while the synoptic gospels all refer merely to "the scribes, pharisees, and sadducees." So it's ironic that one of the most liberal interpretations of Christ is based on the least liberal Gospel.
