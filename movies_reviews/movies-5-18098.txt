Misery is a well-written, well-acted, psychological thriller. It is a horror movie in the sense that if you found yourself in this kind of situation, it would be a horror. Kathy Bates won an Oscar for this movie, so you know she does a convincing job as a mentally disturbed fan. There's not much blood or gore, but it is very entertaining because of the reality of the situation.
