I'm loving this bulshit. Its troops like the ones in Iraq and overseas that make it possible for a fat lard like Moore to make a flick like this. Just disgrace. It is unbelieveable how people can go along with liberal propaganda and believe that Bush is in Iraq for HIS PERSONAL REASONS. Get a clue and realize that we did not elect a president who is so foolish. As Fheit as a movie, poor insight with one sided views. Whomever made this movie needs to kill yourself. We love you Michael Moore. Keep putting out bad movies because the republican party loves to bash your liberal propaganda. Just remember who controls the senate. Bill Frist.
