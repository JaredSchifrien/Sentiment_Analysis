The only movie involving sports that ever interested me because it was so much more than that. A wonderful tale of the underdog all the way around on an off the basketball court. Gene Hackman does his usual stellar job of acting and giving us a very memorable character. Barbara Hershey also does a very believable job as his love interest. But the best performance of all was Dennis Hopper cast as the pathetic, washed up alcoholic father of one of the players. Absolutely excellent job - the best I ve ever seen from Hopper. The story, the music and the era are definitely compelling. I misted up from the start since, on a personal level, it really reminded me of my father. That was in great part due to the fact that they filmed the championship game at Hinkle Field House on the Butler University Campus (Indianapolis, Indiana) where my father attended college in the early 1950 s. So, of course, when the call went out for extras one of my cousins and I naturally answered it. Oh, yes, I m in Hoosiers even though you couldn t find me with a microscope! LOL!
