ever wonder why the exorcist is always at the top of every horror movie list? thats not an accident. this movie is well, argumentivly the best horror movie ever made. William Peter Blatty really did his homework on this movie and William Friedkin did an unbelievably amazing job taking it off paper and on the screen. my hats off to both of you. an amazing story of an ordinary, innocent child, possesed, and the trials and tribulations of driving the evil out. this movie is one of the creepest movies i have ever seen. as thorne said, it shows us how completely vulnerable we really are. if you haven't seen this movie, don't see the re-released version, the ending sucks. see the original. the ending that leaves you wondering, did good triumph over evil, or was it the other way around. astonishing performances by Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blair and, well the whole cast blew me away with their terrific performances. this movie is god of all the religious horror movies ever made(i can't believe lost souls even tried to pretend they werein the same league as the exorcist), and will definately keep your eyes glued yo the screen. a movie for all genarations that i guaruntee will never die.this movie is THE horror movie classic.
