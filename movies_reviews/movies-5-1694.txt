Don't think that you won't enjoy this because it is one, a foreign film or two, a martial arts film. Ang Lee is the director of Ice Storm and Ride With the Devil both high profile American movies. He is also the director of Wedding Banquet/Eat Drink Man Woman/and Pushing Hands. He knows character, action, story and cinematography. Crouching Tiger is a Chinese fairy tale come to life. I loved it. You will believe that man can fly.
