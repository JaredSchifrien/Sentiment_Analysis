Dark, intense, gritty, these are just a few of the adjectives I'd used to describe this little-known, 1965 classic, The Hill. The film - shot in black and white - depicts the corruption and sadistic abuse of prisoners who are treated as barbaric animals held captive inside a slaughterhouse/British Military prison, in the region of northern Africa. Sean Connory plays the protagonist in perhaps the finest acting effort of his entire career - his opinion as well! The title of the film refers to a huge, steep mound of compacted dirt on which the subjects are forced to tread up and down continuously, carrying heavy sandbags beneath the hot, blistering desert sun.
