An excellent update, which has a few additions,and is quite entertaining. Lindsay Lohan does an exceptional job playing 2 people, and the rest of the cast are great. The musical score adds to the whinsical movie, and was used in the following year's academy awards for costume design. An excellent remake from the people who did 'father of the bride'.
