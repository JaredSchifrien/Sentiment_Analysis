This is a fun flick to watch Bruce is great and the effects are not bad at all. This has to be a cult classic and it sounds great in surround sound. Casting is wonderful and the story is an oldie but goodie. Fight scenes are good and there is a lot of humor through out the movies which keeps it moving. A must see DVD !
