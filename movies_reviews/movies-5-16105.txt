I was frozen dead in my tracks by this film. Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick have great on screen chemistry in this film about a newly released pedophile who battles with his inner demons and desires. Man...I've never come across a film that showed such humanity in what everyone can safely agree is the scum of the earth. I actually felt compassion for Kevin Bacon-that's got to be the highest praise I can give this film. Some tense and hard to watch moments in the film as well as great performances by Mos Def, Eve and Benjamin Bratt.
