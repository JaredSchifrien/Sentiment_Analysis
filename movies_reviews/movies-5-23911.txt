I have to give this a five just because I'm in love with the story. But where did the makers go wrong (other than hiring the screenplay writer!)? I think it is with the audience. The people who go to see movies today are not the type who can handle a gritty literary/historical saga such as this one. They want their heroes to be clean-cut good guys, and it goes against Achilles' nature to be put in such a non-ambiguous role. He is supposed to be the hero you have to admire for his sheer worth as a warrior and his grief at Patroclus' death, but at the same time hate him for being so pig-headed, and for killing Hector, his honorable foil. But I think that audiences who would prefer to be dazzled rather than made to think could not handle a hero as complex as Achilles. Which was too bad. My other complaint was Paris. By the end of the movie I was desperate to see him get his come-upance---but it never came! Instead, he becomes Legolas to Achilles' Boromir, only this time they're on opposing sides. And Menelaus? He's supposed to survive, and totally unexplicably forgive Helen for everything she's done him! My explanation for this not turning out---the audience would once again not be able to handle a softening, if that is what causes this unusual conclusion to Helen's bit of the epic, of the bad guy's heart.
