This is why they are called classics . Double Indemnity is white hot. It is noir at its best and rest assured this film will make a lasting impression on you. At a minimum it will make you a lifelong Barbara Stanwyck fan. Talk about a Femme Fatale! McMurray and Stanwyck play off each other in a way that seems much more contemporary considering how long ago this film was made. Double Indemnity stands the test of time and is a true noir classic.
