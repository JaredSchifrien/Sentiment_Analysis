This is an awesome movie. Nothing happens? Actually a lot happens. This is a realistic movie, not Charlie's Angels. Plot: a struggling alcholic writer and his soon to be married friend go an a bachelor party trip through the California wine country. This movie explores two middle age failures. It is very funny.
