When someone told me this was the best gangster film ever written I laughed in their face. Once I watched it, my mouth literally hit the floor as I heard my laughter come back to haunt me in what I can only describe as a resounding I told you so. This film is near genius accompanied with perfect casting, clear settings and a now very familiar famous soundtrack this all aids a very detailed account of the Corleone family, especially the Don who serves as the main patriarch of the family he loves whilst trying to balance the criminal instinct inside. We don't get to see the real Don Corleone until The Godfather Part 2 - played brilliantly by Robert Deniro. Definitely worth watching.
