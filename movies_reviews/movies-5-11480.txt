A REAL romantic comedy...that's why I liked it so much. It's sweet, adorable and light. Afterwards, I didn't regret taking along my 6 year old. My husband liked it, too, except for the little white lies that the main characters tell. One more thing bothered him: the fact that I very easily convinced him to see this chick-flick not only once, but twice. And he liked it better the second time! Same as I did.
