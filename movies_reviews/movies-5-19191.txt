This is probably one of the greatest horror movies ever, and this is not an exaggeration. Not only does it have an intelligent story and some of the most gruesome horror effects, but well worked-out characters on both sides, which makes it superior to mere splatter movies like Friday the 13th series or films like Dawn of the Dead. That's what makes this film very recommendable to watch even more than once.
