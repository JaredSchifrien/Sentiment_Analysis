I'm not sure how I lasted so long without seeing this movie, but it just turned out that way. After hearing friends of mine rave about it, quote from it ( Did you get the digits? ), and compare themselves to characters in the movie, I was kind of expecting the worst. Swingers is in fact an amazing movie - and oddly touching. It's a guys' movie through and through, and does a very believable job of portraying how single guys act and act towards each other - without falling into the trap of beer commercial stereotypes. Definitely a movie to rent for your buddy who is coming off of a rough break up. Five stars.
