One of the best war genre movies of all time. It has big name stars like Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, James Garner and many more. It also has great action, dialogue, and suspense. It;s over 2 hours long, but never boring. You get caught up in the characters and there personal lives as well as the general plot. Definitely a must see for the whole family.
