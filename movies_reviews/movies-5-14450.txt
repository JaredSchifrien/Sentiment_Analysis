I have two favorite sports movies that stand out from the rest...Remember the Titans and Hoosiers. Both coaches came into hostile territory and proved how they could help shape the lives of high schoolers. High School sports can make or break young people but these two coaches in these two movies helped make responsible adults out of their athletes. What made Hoosiers even better was Dennis Hoppers performance. Hackman's character not only made men out of boys, but inspired a man to be a man too!
