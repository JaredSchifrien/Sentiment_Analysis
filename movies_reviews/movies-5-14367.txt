As a person with some retired habits of a highly questionable nature, I feel comfortable informing you that this film does justice to the desperation and hopelessness of heroin addiction. The movie comes from the book by Hubert Selby, Jr. Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn give exceptional performances. This was as uncomfortable as I have been while watching a movie since seeing A Panic In Needle Park. It was so powerful that I didn't realize I had seen a great motion picture until much later in the evening. One of those films that makes you feel like you need a shower immediately after viewing.
