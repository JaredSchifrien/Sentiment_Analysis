I couldn't agree more with the comment of Eb.b5644om . This is a very manupulative film with laughable scripts and false emotions, worst of all Julie Robert is most annoying ever! Obviously, this is the usual Robert's ugling duckling comedy sugar coated in dramatic form since it claimed itself adapted from the true story. Many people thus thought they have seen a great dramatic film. I cannot believe its popularity and critical acclaims except from Roger Ebert (check out his comment). The bad langauge is unbelievable. I doubt the real Erin could get a job in a law firm with this degree of foul mouth, rude attitude and prostitute-worn wardrobes, let alone insult the lawyers made completely idiots in the film. Remember films based on true story do not always have the right details or even story lines!
