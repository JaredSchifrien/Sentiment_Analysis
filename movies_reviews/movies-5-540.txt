In my opinion this movie excedes, by far, The Godfather when it comes to portraying the mafia in a realistic way. There is no sugar-coating found here. Joe Pesci is perfect as a half crazy risk taking murderer who can still make you laugh. Lorraine Bracco, Robert De Niro, and Ray Liota are all in top form as well.
