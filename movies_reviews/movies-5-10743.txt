i like how varied the cast is in this film. Rowan atkinson is hilarious as a narcaleptic, Cuba Gooding Jr. is funny with his 'Lucy' counterparts, and of course, who can forget the John Lovitz hitler scene that made me laugh for twenty minutes. The entire cast works great together! A great movie from beginning to end!
