The most entertaining of all of Martin Scorsese's film and a candidate for the best film of the nineties. It's just so fun to watch Paukie, Jimmy, Henry and especially Tommy do their thing! In every single shot, you can clearly see Scorsese recalling his childhood days, sitting in front of a movie screen and watching gangster movies. Goodfellas is a masterpiece.
