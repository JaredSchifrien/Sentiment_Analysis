Although this movie had a lot of language and people may not agree with that I feel overall the movie was just LIFE. I know of many people that have similar life experiences. I feel the movie portrayed how we really act in our true lives. I felt the actors made you feel as if you were in the situations with them. I felt they made you feel as if they werent acting at all! I recommend this movie 100% to anyone that wants to see a movie that you can relate to. Beware there is a lot of adult talk and scenes. But overall the movie is just truth of how we all are!
