Four young boys out on an adventure before they're to old to be ruined by adulthood. The relationship between these boys, their interactions and behaviors are all believable. The boys parts are acted very well-River Phoenix was great, so were the other 3 who I can't remember their names right now. I've probably seen this movie 5 times, it's on my top 20.
