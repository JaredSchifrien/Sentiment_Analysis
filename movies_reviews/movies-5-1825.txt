Obviously A Real Clint Fan would not bang this Movie or knows how to play a good hand of Faro ? or the Kid has NO IDEA of AMERICAN HISTORY with the rivalry with the Earps and the Clantons...Hummmm !! This is all real Stuff and the Director has done an INCREDIBLE JOB to recreate these events .ALL STAR CAST INCLUDING .. Kurt Douglas , Jason Priestly , Powers Boothe , Charleston Heston , Val Kilmore , Dana Delaney , Michael Beiyn and Michael Zaine !! WAY TOO MANY TOO LIST BUT WE KNOW WHO YOU ALL ARE AND THIS WAS THE BEST MOVIE THAT IS OUT THERE and WORTH EVERY CENT. THE VERY BEST ACTING I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME ! I Feel like I'm right in there while the whole movie is coming down . Colors and Camera movement is Incredible and the actors worked extremely hard to make this movie come alive . Moustaches and Beards on all OUR favourite actors are real and is Directed by the BEST Director out there ...Mr.George Cosmatos ! ITS ALL GOOD AND IF ANYONE DOES NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE , THEY MUST BE FROM ANOTHER PLANET !! INCREDIBLE CAST AND CREW , I LOVE THE WHOLE THING from start to finish ! Cheers PS..If You Have'nt seen TOMBSTONE , Perhaps we won't be friends ! (c; hahahaha
