As a thriller, The Silence of the Lambs certainly serves its purpose. A fine script with a solid cast. Hopkins gave an especially chilling performance as the evil but brilliant Dr. Hannibal Lector. Overall, the film managed to keep my attention and never seemed to slow down. A solid five-star thriller.
