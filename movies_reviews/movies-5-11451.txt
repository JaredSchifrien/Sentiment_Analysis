With a dearth of family movies out this summer, we took a gamble and took our kids (ages 8 and 10) to it. Though it was PG, there was nothing really objectionable other than they said the word Crap now and then. The movie, kind of a dead-panned Revenge of the Nerds meets Judy Blume set in an Idaho High School, it was surprisingly funny (my wife was in extreme stitiches). Napoleon (played brilliantly by Jon Heder) was hilarious. In fact, each character is delightfully absurd in their own way. I got a kick out of Dietrich Bader (Otto from the Drew Carey Show); he was my favorite as the wacko Sensei, Rex, who taught the lost martial art of Rex Kwon DO. Though I find most Indie films pretentious and way overhyped, not so with Napoleon Dynamite. It's an excellent film.
