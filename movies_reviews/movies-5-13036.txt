The movie that started it all. What can be said that has not been said already about this movie? It is undeniably the best modern mafia movie ever made, and is briliantly adapted from Mario Puzo's book. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando play their parts exquisitely. If you haven't seen this already, you should.
