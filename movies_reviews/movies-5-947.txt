From the distance of twenty-five years, it still holds up as one of the greats. Only minor caveat is Robert Shaw's hammy performance, which clearly shows he thought he was acting in a piece of crap. Otherwise everything, particularly the direction is brilliant. Spielberg's best movie, along with the television movie Duel. (Not ET, not Schindler's Laundry List)
