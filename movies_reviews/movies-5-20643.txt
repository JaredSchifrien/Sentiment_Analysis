I'am proud to say that Grease is the greastest musical ever made, and is definatly considered to be a classic today. Danny and Sandy fell in love at the beach, but were split up when she had to move back to Sydney with her parents. But, her schedule changes, and they end up at the same high school together. She is now part of the pink ladies, a small little gallop of girls that smoke, drink, and date. Danny is part of the t-birds; a mix between Saturday Night Fever and Fonzie. Great soundtrack, in fact the best one out there.
