Lucky enough to see it the night before it opened. I loved it. It is amazing how some of the things in the movie looked exactly as I imagined them to. Diagon Alley for example was almost a perfect match, as was Gringott's. Hogwarts itself was very different from what I imagined, but it was very cool. I loved the moving staircases! The actors all perfectly conveyed their characters, and I especially liked Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint as Harry, Hermione and Ron. Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid was wonderful and they could not have picked a better Dumbledore or Snape! I do have only one concern though. The book was about 150 pages, the movie was about 2.5 hours... What happens when we get to Goblet of Fire at 750 pages? In all, I highly recommend this movie!
