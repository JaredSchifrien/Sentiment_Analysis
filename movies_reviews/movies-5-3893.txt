 The Lion King is an all-around classic that I fully plan on showing my children, and hopefully, 100 years from now, will still be appreciated for what it is: a great movie for the family. Rarely have I seen Walt Disney produce a film such as this- I still watch it every now and then even at the age of 15. It just never seems to bore me, espescially with the hilarious antics of Tummone and Pumba. I concur with Castlebee that Jeremy Irons played the voice of Scar perfectly- what a perfect villian! this movie is so dramatic that I actually used to cry when Mufasa died. A great mixture of drama, comedy, romance and music!
