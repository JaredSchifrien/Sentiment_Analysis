If you have trouble falling asleep then I prefer Gone With the Wind. Someone pretty much made me watch this... and every time I think of this film I start to get a little sleepy!!! Why people rate this high is beyond me... that is obviously their own opinion, but WOW... snooze fest if I ever seen one!!!
