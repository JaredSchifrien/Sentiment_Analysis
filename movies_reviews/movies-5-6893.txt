Stupid, but that't the point. One of the funniest movies ever made. Amazing how 25 years later one person quoting one line will start a flurry of quotes. Much like Caddyshack or The Blues Brothers in that sense. Be careful what line you quote and where you quote it. Have you ever seen a grown man naked? can get you in trouble.
