If you see Gene Wilder's name on a movie, you can bet you are about to be entertained. While not a great actor, he is good at delivering a laugh, and this movie is no exception. One would think that a movie with a song called SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER wpould be unwatchable, but Mostel and Wilder make it worthwhile. IJR says check it oout!
