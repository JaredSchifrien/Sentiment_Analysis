What really bugs me are people (especially Christians!) who put down Hollywood movies and other entertainment as being morally wrong aand violent, yet hold Disney up as a moral guidepost for the rest of the industry. Yet, here we have a movie about one jelous brother killing his sibling and chasing away his competition, who eventually comes back and extracts revenge. Really sweet, feel good movie, isn't it?
