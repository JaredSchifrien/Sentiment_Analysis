the best part of this movie, i think, was morgan freeman's character. it's nice to see such a 'serious' actor take on such an amusing role. the three main characters (carrey, aniston, freeman) all work well together. this movie is sappy at times, but the funny parts balance that stuff. for dvd owners, the outtakes are by far the funniest i've seen.
