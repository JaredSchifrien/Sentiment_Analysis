This was such a great movie and one of my alltime favorite movies. James Stewart always blows me away and this is chareceter is absoultely amazing. I would never be able to stand on my feet for a whole 48 hours was it? Just to stand up to something he believe in, he was incredible. I wish we had more politicians like Mr. Smith in our days today!
