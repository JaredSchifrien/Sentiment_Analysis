Forget the (quite typical)plot contrivances:here's another glorious winner for Astaire-Rogers fans to revel in.Peerless Jerome Kern score- The Way you look tonight,Pick yourself up,A Fine Romance..-and a stream of breathtaking dance routines,with Fred dazzling as ever and Ginger at her most radiant.The Never gonna dance sequence is for me the peak of their legendary partnership;not only sparkling,graceful and romantic,but also tremendously touching.Sublime moments that always leave me gulping.
