This movie freaked me out. Linda Blair did an amazing job, no wonder she had to go into therapy after that. The effects are very good considering that movie is from the 70's. I was disgusted at times, but I think this movies is one of the best movies of that decade. If you don't like horror movies, you might want to skip this one cause this one will freak your freak
