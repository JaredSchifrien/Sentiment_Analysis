This is one of my top 5 all time favorite movies. I love anything and everything regarding the mob and this movie gives me a big dose of mobsters. I don't know if it is love as much as fascination. The acting is great. It has a lot of big names like Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Leota. It goes through a long period of time and the characters really develop throughout the film.
