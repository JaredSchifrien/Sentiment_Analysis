The opening scene to this film is fantastic - great combination of the helicopter blades and the air conditioning fan in the room. The film was loosely based on the book 'Heart Of Darkness' in respect to the journey down the river and descending more into hell. I wasn't too sure about the French plantation sccene, but otherwise I love this film. Martin Sheen, Laurence Fishburne, Marlon Brando and Harrison Ford are fantastic. This is a very important film and a must see.
