Im a big fan of Jason, he's da man!! I love the thrill and of course the chi chi chi ha ha ha in the movies. I have his mask on my bedroom wall and dissguised as Jason for halloween since I was like 13 years old.The first 3 movies sucked but the rest we're kool.I have all his movies and will love him forever. JASON RULES!!!!
