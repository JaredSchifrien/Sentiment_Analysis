One of the best family films of all time. I laughed. I cried, and if you didn't, you really aren't human. This film goes far beyond the realm of science fiction, and touches the heart of any individual. Even today, I am impressed to see such a lasting film. No other film has ever come close to what this film attempted and succeeded at.
