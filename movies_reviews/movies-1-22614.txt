I could only give this movie one star because of the entertainment. As a movie itself it was one of the worst movies i have ever seen i seriously could not even sit through it. There were many actors and actresses that took part in this movie but how good could they act if they had a screenplay that was pathetic. Don't get me wrong I love comics and love marvel heroes but this was the worst portrayl of the marvel heroes ever. Rogue and sabertooth saved the movie but where the heck is Gambit?
