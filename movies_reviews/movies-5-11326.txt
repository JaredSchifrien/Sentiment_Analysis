This movie may be rated PG, but the humor is definitely not geared toward children. Of course, neither was Pee Wee s Playhouse for the most part. One of the most creative, quirky and unique films ever made, Pee Wee s Big Adventure remains hilarious after 16 years. Many of the lines are burned in my memory not only from having watched this film many times but also because Pee Wee and this movie were so widely imitated at the time and well into the early 90 s. It s strange how some people seemed to forget how funny this movie was and how much they enjoyed it after Ruebens was caught attempting to cause himself to go blind in that Florida theater. Hugh Grant wasn t really doing much better than that himself once upon a time and it seemed to only boost his popularity. Hmmmmm. Well, I have no plans to marry either one of them, so I guess I m still free to enjoy their work.
