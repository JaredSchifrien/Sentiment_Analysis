A excellently produced closer to possibly the greatest movie trilogy to ever exist. Just like the first two, The Return of the King has all around great acting, beautiful scenery, one of the best adaptation screenplays ever written, and A+ editing. This is one movie, just like the entire trilogy, that was meant to be seen on the big screen.
