A wonderful movie, exchanges between the Darko family are well orchestrated and funny. The plot was very thought provoking and the characters are well developed. For those who say it lacks in entertainment, it requires more than a seventh grade education and a white picket fence with a beautifully manicured lawn to appreciate.
