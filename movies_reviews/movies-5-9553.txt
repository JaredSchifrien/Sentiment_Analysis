Swingers is one of my favorites of all-time and the first movie I actually purchased. It is brilliantly written by Jon Favreau who originally wrote it so that he and his friends would have a movie to star in. As another reviewer, Ruby, said, this isn't laugh out loud funny. Instead, any guy who watches the movie will see that just about every scene hits home in some way. Vince Vaughn steals the movie as Trent, a guy who women want to sleep with and guys want to be friends with. Fellas, if you haven't seen this film, check it out. Your girlfriend won't like it as much as you do, but it will make up for all of the times she made you sit through all of those chick-flicks.
