Just happened to be on tv this evening. Always knew it was considered a powerful movie, but never actually watched it before. Watching it, I have to say it's the most touching piece of cinema I've seen since Schindler's List. My first impression was: You KNOW s**t like that's happening in Iraq right now. The second was: This should be required viewing for any soldier setting foot there.
