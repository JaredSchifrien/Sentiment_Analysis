You know, where do I begin with the pile of trash? First of all, I refuse to believe a tornado is powerful enough to whip a cow around 700 times, but isn't powerful enough to throw the truck they drive off the road. Oh, and Id swear the plot of this movie simply revolved around knocking over tornado tracking devices! Hellooooo, is there any intelligence left in Hollywood??? And I love the fact that the tornado comes, clouds are black...YET NOT ONE DROP OF FREAKIN RAIN! And if I see a tornado, I don't know about you, but I'm running the opposite direction, I sure as hell aint going to chase it down like these retarded idiots! The movie sucked!
