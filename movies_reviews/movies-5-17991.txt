If a horror film is supposed to scare the be jesus (sp?) out of people then this is one helluva horror film. I hate horror movies, hate 'em. Partly because I think they're usually kinda cheesey and partly because,..well 'cause they're scary but this one is really scary. I must've seen this when I was about 10 or so and it totally freaked me out.
