The first Nightmare on Elm St. is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Freddy is great because he scares the hell out of me and makes me laugh at the same time. All of the Nightmare movies have their scary moments. The one where Alison's brother got tore up by Freddy in the school restroom made me afraid to go in public restrooms for along time.
