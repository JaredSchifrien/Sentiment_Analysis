what can i say, this is at the top of my worst sequels list, right next to urban legends, final cut, i still know what you did last summer, and halloween 3. ok, its jason takes manhattan, yet the entire movie takes place on a cruise ship exept at the end when they drift ashore on manhatton. the last 20 min. of the movie is in manhattan. it was cute when the black guy got his head blocked off, but honestly, if a couple of punks were giving jason sh*t, would jason really just show them his face? this movie was a travesty to the friday the 13th series. besides, jason looks so decayed in this movie that a stiff breeze would take him out. this movie sucks!
