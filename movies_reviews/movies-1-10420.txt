Finally a movie that shows Mel Gibson's arrogance in complete clarity. His ego maniac persona shined thruout this whole movie without ever taking a break. He has no talent, is very unattractive, and couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. If you can actually look around Mel's inflated head at the movie itself, it will just make you fall asleep, as it lacks all forms of entertainment needed in any type of movie...a movie that should be missed and I would never recommend it...don't waste your money...
