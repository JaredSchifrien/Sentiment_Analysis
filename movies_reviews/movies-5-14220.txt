This movie hits home. I have an uncle who has schizophrenia. ClassicTVFan, How could you not be moved by this movie? It's a true story of a man's real suffering. Do you not feel sorry for him? He didn't ask to be that way. Sometimes, I hope you do not have a bias against the mentally ill, which would hurt my feelings very much because I have severe clinical depression. This movie raises awareness about a disease. It's inspiring and beautiful.
