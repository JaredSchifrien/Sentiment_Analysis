OH MY GOD! This movie was so hilarious I could not stop laughing the first time I watched it and I still can't help myself even after over two hundred times of watching it! Dr. Evil is so funny, and Scott Evil is drop-dead gorgeous. Austin Powers and Austin Powers 2 are my favorite movies of all time!
