I recently saw this again on TV and I had forgotten how great this film was. Even though a lot of it was cut out due to profanity, it reminded me that I need to rent it again and soon. In terms of mob movies, this one ranks just a hair below Godfather and Godfather II. Joe Pesci was at his psychotic and comedic best and his performance provides enough of reason by itself to see this film. The movie's climactic scene is shot superbly. I've never done cocaine, but after watching that scene, I have a pretty good idea of how I would feel.
