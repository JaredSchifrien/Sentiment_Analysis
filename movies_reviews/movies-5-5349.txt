This is one of the best movies ever made. It's so hard to pick a favorite scene, but if I just had to...it would be the scene on the steps of the jailhouse when Scout brought that lynch mob back to reality as only a child could have done. The kids roles (Scout, Jem and Dill) were outstanding. They took me back to a simpler time when all you needed was an old mop, and suddenly you had the fastest horse in the neighborhood. This was Gregory Peck's finest work. No one else could have brought Atticus to life the way that Gregory Peck did. Brock Peters portrayal of Tom Robinson was astounding to say the least (can't just go busting up any ole body's chifferobe). And who could forget the eeriness with which Robert Duvall portrayed Boo Radley. This movie makes you feel as though you were there. They just don't make em like that anymore.
