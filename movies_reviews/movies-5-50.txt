Unquestionably the greatest action/adventure film of all time. Spielberg and Lucas together make an unbeatable combination. With great performances, solid directing and story-telling and a wonderful score, Raiders of the Lost Ark is the epitome of what good ole' fashioned entertainment is all about.
