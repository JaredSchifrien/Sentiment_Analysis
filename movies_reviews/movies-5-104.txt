This movie was thrilling from beginning to end. Very few dull spots, and Jodie Foster is so believable in her character that it gave me goose bumps. While I normally do not care for movies that involve serial killers, this movie is a MUST-SEE for those seeking a good Jodie Foster movie. It can be kinda scary at times as well. Not a recommended movie for children however.
