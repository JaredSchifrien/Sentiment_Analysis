I thought this was one of the best movies I've ever seen. I HATED the ending though. The movie made you think and see things from a different slant. There is some profanity and a few areas that are a little on the sleezy side, if it weren't for that I'd show it to students in school every where. Even with all that I think all kids in 10th grade up should see and discuss this movie-it really makes you think.
