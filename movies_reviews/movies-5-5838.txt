THE best American motion picture of them all! Not GONE WITH THE WIND, not CASABLANACA, not THE WIZARD OF OZ. This film takes the cake! Orson Welles can only be described as a genius, not only of the technical aspect, but of showmanship as well. I advise everyone to go out and rent of buy the DVD of this film. It has to be one of the best DVDs out there.
