I found 'Lost in Translation to be pretty much damn near perfect. Subtle, delicate, touching, tragic - it's one of those movies in which nothing really happens, but for some reason or another, just gets it.... just manages to capture something about the human condition, and relationships and loneliness and foreignness and timing and lots of other uncomfotable things. Bill Murray is masterful - as much for his expressions and the things he doesn't say, as for his lines. Scarlett Johansson was absolutely captivating. Can't wait to see more of Sofia Coppola and Scarlett Johansson.
