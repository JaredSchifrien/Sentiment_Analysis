Ok, I wouldn't give it five stars, except that I'm comparing it to a lot of new comedy releases. Anyway, this movie was hilarious. To actually think about a sweet old lady driving a seemingly normal couple to such extremes, even makes me laugh now. I haven't had so many laugh out loud moments watching a comedic movie in years. It's a must see.
