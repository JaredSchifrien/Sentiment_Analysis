I have seen some of this movie but it is just a rip-off of Halloween they tried to take the juicy eerie scary feeling of Halloween and add in a horrible story women nudity and blood and gore. So in other words do not waste youre time on this movie you are way way way way way way way way way more better of watching the extremley classic John Carpentetrs extremley scary movieHalloween.
