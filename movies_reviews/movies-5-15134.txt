This is one of my favourite Meryl Streep films and boasted a stellar cast. Although the movies subject matter of divorce is depressing Robert Benton and Avery Corman manage to find a balance with the screenplay and novel as to why the mother walked out on her son and how the father manages to cope as a single parent. What I loved about Meryl's performance as Joanna Kramer is that she un-doubtedly did something wrong, but funnily enough I sympathised with her character succumbing to her role as a young mother and wife. Dustin Hoffman was brilliant as Ted Kramer and a very young Justin Henry as Billy Kramer was a complete natural. This film managed to encompass a complicated and somewhat delicate issue of its time.
