This movie made my A list when I first saw it. It is one of the best protrayals of actual American history I have ever seen, and it really brings out some of the work necessary to bring about the greatest technological achievement of all time, and the amount of danger in which the astronauts could easily find themselves. When Tom Hanks made his series on the Apollo missions, his Apollo thirteen episode concentrates on aspects separate from those portrayed in this movie, which allows this movie to become a working part of the series. The work of Kevin Bacon and Gary Sinise brings out some of the greatness of this film, while Tom Hanks easily portrays the pain of aborting a lunar landing. If you haven't seen it, you should. Anyone even vaguely interested in space will be impressed.
