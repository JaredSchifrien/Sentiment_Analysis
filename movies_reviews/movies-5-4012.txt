This film can be liked by people of all ages. The animation is superb. I'd say it's Pixar's best animated film. The story is sweet and very funny, especially Ellen Degeneres as Dory. Each character's personality is warm, humerous and an important part of the story. This is a movie you'll want to watch many times over. It's a very delightful and funny film.
