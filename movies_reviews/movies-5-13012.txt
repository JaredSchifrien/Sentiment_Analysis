This is a movie that any true and dedicated movie fan should watch. It is one of the finest movies in terms of character and story ever put on screen. Superb performances by Al Pacino, James Caan, Marlon Brando, Robert Duval, John Cazale and more. The movie is dark, gritty and violent the way it should be. It just isn't about the mafia, it's about a family. The Godfather and The Godfather Part II is recommended to anyone who likes to watch great art.
