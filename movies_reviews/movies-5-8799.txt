Unless you're a Waiting for Guffman fan or a Spinal Tap fan (both is even better), or at least seen these two films, I honestly don't believe you should see Best in Show. The incredible Christopher Guest is amazing in all three, and the fact that for Guffman and this they only had about 10 pages of script is phenomenal. The improvisational skills of this cast is unbelieveable.
