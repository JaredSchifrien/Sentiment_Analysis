Whoes idea was it to put this film under comedies? This is no comedy. It is one of the most original and beautiful love stories I have ever seen put on film. The performances from every member of the cast (and i mean every member!) are stellar and beyond expectation for such an eighties film starring John Cusack ( remember, One Crazy Summer and countless other shlock crap eighties comedies) this was definatley a change of pass for John Cusack who used this film as a vehicle to establish himself as the talented actor that he is.Ione Skye, yea, this was one of those films she was in and gave a believable performance in before she vanished into obscurity. A light hearted yet moving romantic film about a high school graduate who finally gets up the nerves to ask out the girl of his dreams who hppens to be an over acheiving rich girl who has a very attached father. We'll of course sparks happen and they fall in love and conflict arrise and are resolved by the end of the film. Rest assured it is more entertaining than that. Like Glorybox mentioned, Say Anything contains one of the most classic moments in cinema history. The In Your Eyes Stero scene. This film is about a thousand times better than Cameron Crowes other three films and after watching it once, is addictive. Like heroin. See Trainspotting if you don't know what i am talking about. Say Anything is HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for anyone with a heart and a taste for good romance.
