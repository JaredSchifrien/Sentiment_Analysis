Sorry, but I found it long and boring. Maybe it's because I expected too much. As long as I can remember, I've heard and read about what a great picture this is. (Rated #1 by the National Film Institute). When I compare Citizen Kane (1941) and Casablanca (1942) its like night and day. The storyline, acting and cinematography in Casablanca are vastly superb to Kane.
