My best friend told me that Quills was an amazing movie, but I only thought he said that because it was about sex. However, my boyfriend and I saw it together and were both in tears at the end. A masterful piece, it takes somewhat vulgar bubject matter and transforms it into a powerful story of love, sanity, and censorship. The squeamish should not attend, but others should. The movie speaks for itself.
