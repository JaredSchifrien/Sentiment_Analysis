So bad it is good? I don't see the attraction to this movie. The acting was terrible, the story is barely a story. I heard people describe the dialog as brilliant, personally it felt like a teenager wrote the script, hopping from topic to disjoint topic that keeps the overall story moving, wading knee-deep in circles and ultimately going absolutely nowhere.
