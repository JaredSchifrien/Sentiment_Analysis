This is definitely one of the best movies, uhhhhh..... ever. Entertaining and thought-provoking. I saw the movie, then read the short little story that created the three hours. Maybe because I already knew the story, but the movie was better than the book. Not many movies do that. It actually made me want to become a penologist improving America's prison system.
