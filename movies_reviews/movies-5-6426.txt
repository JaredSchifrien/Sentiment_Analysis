There is a lot in this movie than you might think. After they failed at the box office w/ Duck Soup, the Marx Bros revamped their plots and scripts and put everything but the kitchen sink into them. Apparently, average Depression-era Americans couldn't handle social farces - only fizzy musical/romance/comedy/adventures. Night At The Opera has all of that. It also has some great social commentary - in this case, about the plight of immigrants. You may not notice it, but when Chico and Harpo are loading up with food and playing music w/ the immigrants on the ship, it's very apparent, particularly with how they stare breathless at the loads of food on the buffet table. That always gets me, and it's a testament to the genius of Harpo Marx. Their musical wizardry is also fascinating to me, esp. Harpo's harp playing. It's really beautifully done. You just don't get talent like that anymore. Finally, Groucho is a comic genius. The whole stateroom scene is amazing. If you don't laugh at that, again, you just don;t know what comedy is. This is also one of my all-time great films. I honestly can't fathom how people can not be fans of the Marx Bros. All of the Warner Bros cartoons are based on them! Bugs Bunny IS Groucho Marx!
