This is a great movie, especially the first few minutes. You don't expect a movie to start right there, where other movies wait one hour. It is brutal and harsh, but it was good. Tom Hanks and pretty much everyone else did a good job. I just did not care for Matt Damon's part. I was so looking forward to see Private Ryan and then it was that unthankful guy.
