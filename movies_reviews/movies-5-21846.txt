The Back to the Future series would have to be amongst my favourate movies. They are relatively clean yet funny and have a very interesting story line. Biff would have to be the funniest character, not that I condone bullies! You want to know something interesting about the character who plays Biff. Well he became a dedicated Christian and his ambition is to spread the Love of God around!
