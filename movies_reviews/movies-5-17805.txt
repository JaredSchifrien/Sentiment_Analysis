GREAT FLICK ON SO MANY LEVELS. THE WRITING PRODUCED SOME OF THE GREAT LINES IN MOVIE HISTORY, JACK NICHOLSON WAS PHENOMENAL AS THE FATHER STRUGGLING TO KEEP A GRIP ON REALITY AND HIS SANITY, AND THE MOVIE IS JUST SCARY AS HELL WITH SO MANY MEMORABLE VISUALS I WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN. HORROR FAN OR NOT THIS IS A MUST SEE.
