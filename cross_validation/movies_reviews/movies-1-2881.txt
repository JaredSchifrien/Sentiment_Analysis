Good God this movie is bad. Everything about it is so convoluted, the actions, characters, motives, emotions and the overall screenplay seemed oversimplified and really forced and unnatural. I don't know why Travolta keeps getting cast as the villain, he makes a good effort but honestly he's not that good at it. There are plenty of more convincing villains like keifer sutherland or gary sinise.
