In my top 10 of greatest all time movies, and now one of the best-produced DVDs out there. One of the great ensemble casts of all time. Excellent, original set designs, from the cramped, lived-in Nostromo ship sets to the gloomy alien caverns, bio-ship interiors, and dark planetscapes. The Alien itself is the best designed Alien creature in SF ever, complete with a biological history from egg to adult. Better than Aliens. Alien3 is the worst of the series, but still not that bad. And Alien (4): Resurrection is a good companion piece to Aliens. But this first one is truly the best, complete with a healthy dose of anti-government, anti-corporate paranoia which was expanded on in the sequels. Jones is the best -- and most troublesome-- cat in space. And Jerry Goldsmith's beautiful score is his best. The DVD has TWO isolated scores so you can hear all of his music -- the way he meant to have it in the movie. If you like the movie at all, you'll love the DVD, packed with lots of extras.
