I admit I didn't get this remarkably dark humor at first but I warmed up to it every viewing. Now I think it's absolutely hilarious with the sexual symbolism, metaphors and what-not. Those who didn't like it should try watching it again because people are sure to miss something with only one viewing. Heil Kubrick!
