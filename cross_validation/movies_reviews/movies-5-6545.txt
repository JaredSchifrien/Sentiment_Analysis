This is the good Cape Fear edition as opposed to the goofy Cape Fear done by Scorsese in 1991. I guess the only thing wrong with the 1962 Cape Fear is that it doesn't splatter blood everywhere. Robert Mitchum is a real fearsome villain as opposed to the over the top De Niro villain in the more recent version.
