2 children from a Swedish acting family have to live with a cruel stepfather,a religious minister, when their father dies.If this plot outline sounds like the great director Ingmar Bergman's trademark Nordic gloom,think again;his masterful final(multi-Oscar winning)film is a real heart warmer,full of joyful spirit,much of it centring on Christmas celebrations.A grand,fitting monument to a celebrated career;glowingly photographed,shot through with humanity and even sprinkled with a little magic!
