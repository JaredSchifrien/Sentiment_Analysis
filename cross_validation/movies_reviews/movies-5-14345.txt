5 stars, but a reserved 5 stars. An excellent movie that was also incredibly offensive and revolting at the same time. Why, you ask? The depictions of the lows of human nature which the characters enter are 100% revolting and disgusting. If you have a weak stomach, are opposed to depictions of sex, violence, drug abuse, etc., by all means DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. For those who can appreciate the extremely strong anti-drug message in this movie and stomach watching it, you will not want to watch it again. Once is enough. However, one of the primary reasons I give 5 stars is its possible service to those considering/experimenting with/involved in drug use. If you catch your teenager using or experimenting with drugs, preview this movie and STRONGLY consider making them watch it. It is offensive, but it can serve a purpose. For that, and the fact that it is generally well made, I find I must give it a great rating, despite the fact that I wanted to vomit.
