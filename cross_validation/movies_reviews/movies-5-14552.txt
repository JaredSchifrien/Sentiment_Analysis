I thought the movie was wonderful. It didnt really leave me hanging as everyone said it would. Certain signs that he had while on the island made him realize his paths, and the same when he returned to civilization. It wasnt really that confusing to figure out that he went back to know and fall in love with that women at the cross roads. I thought the movie said alot about life in general. that he was so worried about time and rushing that he would forget what was really important, was the people in his life, and when he was on the island he had nothing BUT time. It made me laugh it made me cry. as of any movie that Robert Zameckis and Tom Hanks are involved in. I give it two thumbs up!!!!!
