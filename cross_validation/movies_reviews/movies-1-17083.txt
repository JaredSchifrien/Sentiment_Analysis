I cannot believe this movie made the Top 100 list. It should not be in the Top 1,000! It is a self-indulgent, vague, badly-acted piece of tripe that in no way deserved the preamble and hype that it got. Casting Cruise and Kidman together was perhaps it's biggest downfall... the two of them seem to spend most of the time trying to out-act each other, and Cruise is patently uncomfortable throughout. It's almost as though the team who put it together sat down and thought of the most likely ingredients for a big audience hey - Kubrick, Cruise, Kidman, 3 hours long, artfully vague plot - Let's do it! (No thank YOU!) Eyes Wide Shut has the dubious honour of being the ONLY movie I have ever walked out of. Oh I tried. God knows I tried. But 90 minutes was more than enough to convince me I had come across one of the most boring movies in motion picture history.
