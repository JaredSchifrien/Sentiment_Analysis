THE cult film of the 1960's. Aside from being amazingly funny it was also a well deserved jab at right wing hawks and the military stupidity of the times. Peter Sellers was beyond excellent and nothing said over zealous droid like Slim Pickins' character as he happily rides the bomb to his death. Yeeeehawwwwww! Gotta love it!
