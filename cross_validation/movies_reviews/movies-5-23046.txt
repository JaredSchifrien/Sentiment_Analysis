I absolutely LOVED Spider-Man! To me, it is the best of ALL of the comic book movies ever made. (Yes, even better than Superman!) Tobey Maguire was a bold choice on director Sam Raimi's part, but he nailed it! Kirsten Dunst was very good as Mary Jane Watson, however the only critique was that she always seemed much more self-assurred than in the movie. That, and she ALWAYS called Pete Tiger . The guy playing Triple-J was AWESOME! He nailed him perfectly! Willem Dafor was a great choice for Gobby! Highly recommended! (For a more indepth review by me, please go to www.overtime.blogspot.com).
