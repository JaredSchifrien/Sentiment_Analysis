This was a spectactular movie and the cast was amazing. Even though it is over three hours long, I couldn't stop watching it. It has such a magical tone to it. And the music is almost eerie. The cast gave an unbelievable performance. Doug Hutchinson was amazing as Percy, the little a**hole, and by the end of the movie you just had the urge to strangle him. Tom Hanks, as always, gives an astounding performance as Paul Edgecombe. Bonnie Hunt was very good, too, as Paul's wife. David Morse was great and I give him two thumbs up for pushing Percy around and nearly beating the crap out of him. Sam Rockwell was so hilarious as Wild Bill. Barry Pepper as the young gaurd on E block. Michael Jeter as the inmate who befriends a mouse. And, of course, Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey, accused of murder, but can give life with the touch of his hands. I loved this movie. The good and the evil in these men of E Block was brought out in a marvelous way. If you loved the movie, read the book.
