The first of 4 movies andthe scariest.Shot in black and white on a shoestring budget.The tension inside the house gets thick enuff to cut with a knife.The dead come back to feed on the living and a group of strangers try to lock themselves into a farmhouse.This was remade in color several years later and the remake isn't bad.The second of the series is a must see .
