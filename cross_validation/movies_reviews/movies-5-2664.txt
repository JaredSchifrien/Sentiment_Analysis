This movie, Gone in 60 seconds...Kicks Ass..! Nicholas Cage did some awesome high speed driving in this flick to the point of leaving me wondering...Did he study under Steve McQueen??? Is that it? Cause that's really saying something when it comes to driving a car as skillfully as that. Now then, if you really want to sit on the tip of your chair in a cold sweat, watching this flick...simply go out and buy or rent a copy of it on DVD ...Do the hometheater and the works. It will blow you out of your seat...promise.
