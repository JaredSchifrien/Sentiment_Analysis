This movie SUCKED. I laughed (at the stupid acting, storyline, casting, and action scenes.), I cried (because the damn movie just would never end.) I fell asleep (for obvious and aformentioned reasons.) I saw this movie on prom night with all of my friends and maybe because we were all too busy making fun of it I really missed the whole point..but I doubt it.
