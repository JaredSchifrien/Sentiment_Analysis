Another misunderstood Kubrick film that will soon be considered a masterwork. The same thing happened to 2001, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon and The Shining--those viewers who didn't get it, watch it again. It took me two viewings to understand what this film is saying. Kubrick simply was unable to make a bad or dull film.
