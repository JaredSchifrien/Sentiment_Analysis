This is my favorite Romantic Comedy of all time-no one of my favorite movies of all time. It's defiently Cameron Crowe's best. It's about a guy named Lloyd (John Cusack, who is absolutely wonderful in everyway.) who falls for rich daddy's girl Ione Skye (who's name in the movie seems to escape me at the moment, which is rather embarrasing considering I was just sprouting it's praises. Oh well..Diane? Is that it? Dammit!) Anyway, It's a beautiful story about first love, heartbreak, loss of innocense, trust,-so many different elements. And it has one of the most romantic scenes ever to be put in a movie ever. If you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about-when Lloyd holds up the radio playing 'In Your Eyes'(My favorite song.) to girl--who's-name-I-can't-remember-dammit!-. I have this big poster on my ceiling of that scene, with the lyrics of that song..I like to look up at it before I go to sleep(corny, i know. shut up.) It gives me hope that my john cusack is out there somewhere, boom box in hand, ready to sweep me away. Too, the emotion shown when they broke up was, well, empathistic (which isn't a word,I know.) and heartbreaking at the same time. I very highly recommend this movie. See it with someone you care about. And because Rateitall refuses to put up it's soundrack, I will say that it too is very good, and, again, highly recommended (look for a live version of Depeche Mode's 'Stripped'.)
