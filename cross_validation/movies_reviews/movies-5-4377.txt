I felt like giving this movie a four or three star rating until I really thought about it. What was wrong with The Goonies? It has to be one of the most entertaining family films ever made. I watched this movie a couple days ago at Glorybox's house and I remember how great this movie actually is. Even if this movie is kind of dark and sinister it has an overall fun and good humored vibe to it. I remember watching it when I was really young and not really getting alot of it. It might confuse or scare some younger viewers. I wouldn't consider this a childrens movie. More of a comedy with its heart in the right place. What I found refreshing about this movie when I watched it the other day was the rather pleasent lack of ass jokes. No farts,no rectal cavity mishaps, it was great! Something the whole family can watch without haveing to see something take a sh*t! Anyway, anyone who has or hasn't seen this see it again...for the first time. (Wow. My hokeyness amazes even me sometimes.) HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
