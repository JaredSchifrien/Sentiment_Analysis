Right down there as one of my least favourite films alongside Gosford Park, Crouching Tiger.. and Mulholland Drive and like those, a pretentious load of cack with a wafer thin storyline and even thinner characters. Tom Cruise's worst film to date and that's saying something. At least films like Godzilla make no pretence to being anything intellectually stimulating. In a word..it's b*llocks.
