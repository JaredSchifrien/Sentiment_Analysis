Well, I caught the 4:00 pm showing of this movie at the theater, and returned for the 9:30 pm showing tonight. While the movie got off to a slow start, and during the first 15 minutes was left to wonder what exactly the hype was all about, when the movie actually got started and my question was answered. It's friggin' hillarious. Vince Vaughn is a hero of mine (I'll forgive him the misfortune that was Be Cool) and this movie made him even more so in my eyes. His facial expressions were nothing short of priceless, and he delivers his lines with such vigor that it looks as though this is the most fun he's had on a set in a long time. Owen Wilson was wonderful as well, playing his typical player-but-nice-guy-at-the-same-time role which was perfect for the movie. It is rude, unappologetic, and had both the audiences I was in today in an uproar of laughter. This movie will be promptly added to my movie collection once out on DVD. It's Wedding Season!
