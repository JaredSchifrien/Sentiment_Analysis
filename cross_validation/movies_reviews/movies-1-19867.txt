Yea, this is after Freddy became a cartoon of his former scarier self. This sequel though, introduces the new way Freddy takes kids out! Unlike part one - 3 where if you kill someone in a dream they die that same way in real life (Tina in part one getting her stomach torn open and thrown all over the room) part four now introduces this way of killing people where if you do in dream land they either have an asthma attack or pass out into a coma! Really slack movie. All the characters left from part three die in this one. Gofigure.
