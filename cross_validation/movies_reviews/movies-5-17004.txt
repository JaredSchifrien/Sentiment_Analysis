This movie is based on a simply delightful, complex book and considering the difficult story it had it did very well. Kate Hudson and Naomi Watts shine as sisters Roxy and Isabel. Their presence on the screen is fantastic. A Fox Searchlight film, it is essentially a foreign film which threw off audiences who hadn't read the book. Dealing with plenty of mini-plots, it's smart and enjoyable.
