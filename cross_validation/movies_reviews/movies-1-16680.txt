I've always been told by my girlfriends how great this film is. After I watched it I decided that the only reason why they had come to that conclusion was because Brad Pitt was in it. A great cast, but a very slow, boring script and plot which lacked any depth of character and resulted in wooden, shallow performances from everyone.
