By far the sickest and most twisted featurw film ever made. No act of nastiness is untouched in this horrifyingly revolting and hilarious shock a minute horror comedy from Troma. Terror Firmer takes place during the filming of The Toxic Avenger 4 and there is a sadistic psycho killer stalking the set and killing those who are demoralizing family values. There a bong stabbings, exploding breasts, escalator mutilation,double leg amputation with semis, naked fat men with frightningly tiny penises running the street, even mangina impalments(You'll know what I'm talking about when you see the climax,yikes!)! One of the most disgusting yet brilliant films ever made. LONG LIVE TROMA!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!! NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART.
