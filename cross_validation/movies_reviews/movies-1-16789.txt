Jack Nicholson always plays a crazy person well, but this film is bad. The movie starts low, and goes lower. The darkness never lets up. While this is the point of the movie, the pledge that drives a man insane, The audience is left completely unfulfilled by the end, and I felt as though my time would have been better spent watching paint dry. Do not see this film, unless of course you already watched the paint dry.
