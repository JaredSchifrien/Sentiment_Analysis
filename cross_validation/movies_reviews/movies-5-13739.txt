One of my favorite movies. Glory is the story of Robert Gould Shaw - the white commander of one of the first battallions of black soldiers in the Civil War. The book which the movie was based upon was written by piecing together letters which Shaw sent back to his New England family - and which are still on display in a Boston museum. The acting is superb - Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington, Matthew Broderick, the story is compelling (and true), and the drama is intense. If you have not seen this movie, brace yourself - it is sad and powerful and deep and historical.
