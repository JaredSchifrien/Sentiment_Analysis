I hate saying it, but not even Snoop Dogg and is great personality could save this sad, sorry, tired piece of trash. So fast paced it's rushed, so poorly written it reads like a Dick and Jane book. Characters so thin they are translucent. Blood so orange it looks like buffalo wing sauce. You cannot help but not feel for any character in this film they are so run of the cheese mill. Snoop is fun to watch but gave a much better performance in the recent film, Training Day, which showcased a more talented side. This is just Snoop having fun with the little he is givin. Jimmy Bones comes back seeking vengence against those who betrayed him years past. He comes back and kills them all in fifteen, maybe twenty minutes. No build up. No suspence. No one cares. He then wants to continue lovin his girl played by Pam Grier and start a relationship with his daughter of which he never had a chance to meet because he got killed. Lame as hell and just plain bad, Bones should crawl up and be put back in it's grave. Poor ol, Snoop.
