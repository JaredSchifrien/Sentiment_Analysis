Blazing Saddles is the last spoof you'd want to have on your wish list. It is never, ever funny, and is an embarrassment to Mel Brooks, who really tried his best to spoof westerns, but this movie is totally dull and boring. The characters are introduced to the film, and then dropped from the script and not heard from again.
