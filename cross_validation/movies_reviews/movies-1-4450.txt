Horrible remake of a kids cartoon that needed no such treatment. It expanded the 'Grinch' universe. It just speaks to the arrogance of Hollywood. The notion that they could do something like this is appaulling That did not need doing either. Jim Carrey plays him ok, but not what it should have been. They should learn from their mistakes and not do things like this. Twenty-two minutes is just right for the Dr. Seuss classic.
