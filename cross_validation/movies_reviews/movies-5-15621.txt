I really loved this movie. I had heard some criticism that the supporting characters were more dynamic than Ada and Inman, but to be fair, Ada and Inman are reserved and introverted people. I had also heard that the Southern accents were not that good, but I did not think they were really that bad. Jude Law portrayed Inman as a strong but silent type, who will stop at nothing to be reunited with his sweetheart. What woman wouldn't want a lover as devoted and romantic as Inman? Nicole Kidman did not stretch herself as she did in The Hours. Ada came off as a bit too delicate and ephemeral, but perhaps we were seeing her through Inman's eyes, whose perception of his ladylove was very idealized. Renee Zellweger chewed the scenery as the capable Ruby, who helped Ada revitalize her farm and avoid starvation. Philip Seymour Hoffman was masterful as the lecherous preacher, and I believe if he had had a few more scenes he would have been nominated for a well-deserved Best Supporting Actor award. I imagine we are going to see a lot more of this gifted character actor. I agree with previous reviewers that the cinematography was gorgeous;although Cold Mountain was filmed in Romania, that pristine, mountainous country looks like North Carolina. Finally, I am glad I chose Cold Mountain as a birthday present for myself; it makes an excellent addition to my growing DVD collection.
