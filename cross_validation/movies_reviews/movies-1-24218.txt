Awful movie! By far the worst blockbuster of the year. What clumsy, pompous, lackluster boring directing this was. The only part of the movie that was true to the spirit of the comic was HULK battling the tanks. The dogs were dumb. Letting Banner's father, the person he hates most, talk to him, knowing he'll most likely piss him off and make em change into the HULK and escape was dumb. Making the HULK change in the water tank, without having a way to contain him was dumb. The ending was dumb. The script was so dadpan. The split screens and the soundtrack was oppressive and out of place. How can you make the HULK boring??? I felt nothing for Banner, unlike Bill Bixby's character, who I really sympathized with. Thanks Ang Kee for destroying what should have been a great and excited Marvel movie.
