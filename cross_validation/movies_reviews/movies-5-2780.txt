I thought that this movie was the best. I love Drew Barrymore, and Cameron Diaz wasn't too bad. My mom surprised me by taking me, and I would have goen to see it anyday then going bowling with my friends. It was so cool, and Natalie (Cameron Diaz) just loved to shake her butt in her spiderman underwear.
