This movie was one of my all time favorites. I was only about 12 when I first saw this movie. But the fantasy of just thinking about this plot gives you a good feeling. I actually wish all aliens were like that. Instead of fighting the aliens they approach the aliens to befriend them. And in return they were granted the fountain of youth. That just goes to show how much you can accomplish when you're an alien.
