The truth about attending IU in the movie is great. I was there and coached 3 Little 500 teams in which Steve Tesich rode! I saw the friction and fights between townies and students and knew a lot of stone-cutters. Paul Dooley is a gem of a father; and the guys have it just right. Life is Bloomington is just as depicted. By the way, I'm in the opening of the race scenes, but not as an actor.
