The perennial runner-up to Citizen Kane (and occasional #1) in major international polls,and greatest masterpiece of Jean Renoir,surpassing the work of his father the painter.An aviator hero in love with a countess is invited to her lavish weekend party at a country chateau- cue for a wonderful blend of comedy,drama and tragedy.Initially banned when released on the eve of World War 2(for its unpopular but insightful observations on French society),it overflows with the director's trademark humanity,wisdom,intelligent dialogue and cinematic expertise.The camerawork and coordination of movement are quietly astounding.Renoir was undoubtedly one of the handful of finest international directors,revered by peers and critics alike.His La Grande Illusion is an established anti-war classic, Boudu Saved from Drowning an exceptionally witty and lyrical social study,but my favourite is his miniature gem, Partie de Campagne / A Day in the Country .
