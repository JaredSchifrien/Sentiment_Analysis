I rented this movie a year or so ago and had completely forgotten how compelling the story was and how incredibly well made the movie was. The acting, the production numbers, the cinematography, the historical context were all amazing. It hasn't lost an ounce of the impact it made 30-plus years ago when it was thought to be a shocking movie.
