One of the most well acted movies to ever be produced. Joan Crawford is fantastic in her role as the persecuted wheel chair ridden sister. Victor Buono is magnificent in his role of piano playing lover. But one of the best roles in all of screen hostiry is portrayed by Bette Davis as the psychopathic fiend who is slowly going insane and returning to her childhood. You won't turn it off once it is on. Definitely see this chiller classic.
