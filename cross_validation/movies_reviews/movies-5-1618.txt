Se7en is one of those rare films that not only astounds the viewer while it is playing before their eyes, but burns an imprint in their mind long after the final credits have rolled. And for a serial killer film to be memorable at all is a great feat in itself. Not only has this movie got an impeccable cast, script, direction,etc., but the only thing UNoriginal about it is that it involves a serial killer. Everything else about it is innovative and thought provoking. A city drowned by a monsoon may not be an original film idea, but a city in sunny California being pelted by an endless downpour is! The cinematography was in color, but the only colors vivid in the film were greys, dingy browns, and black! The serial killer involving the cops in his scheme of things to be the final victim is something that is astonishing! With Spacey's monologue the viewer may find himself/herself making sense of murders that were so senseless and inhuman and with that the serial killer brings the average, normal person to his level of reason. What is so ironic about this film is that John Doe seems to be the one trying to find God in a place where God just doesn't exist- the relentless rain and muted colors are a sign of that and, in the final scene, the roles of victim and killer are reversed. Every time I see this film, (15x and counting) I can't help but to be left in bewilderment and in awe!
