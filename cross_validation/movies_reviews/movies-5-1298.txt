What a great movie. It resurrected John Travolta's career and includes some of the most well written and original material in recent memory. You got to love the conversations between Travolta and Samual Jackson. However, this movie is definitely not for everyone. It includes some pretty graphic violence, but none of it is gratuitous. It is also incredibly funny with some of the funniest moments coming as a result of the violence. The soundtrack is one of the best ever.
