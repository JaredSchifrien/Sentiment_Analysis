Arguably one of Stanley Kubrick's most exciting movies, a Clockwork Orange violently takes on the ideas of morality and sensitivity. While the obscene scenes (which helped to ban the movie for a couple of decades) show how the main character becomes too sensitive to like crime and rape, the viewer becomes desensitized, and vice versa. This movie also shows how evil impulses transcends who people seem to be.
