Unlike my predecesors on this post, I know that this is the second in the series of mariachi movies, thus it is not as original as it may seem. I do love the movie though. Intense action as the mariachi hunts down the man who took away his livelyhood by shooting his woman and shooting him through his hand so that he could no longer play guitar. I will always be grateful to Robert Rodriquez for introducing America to Salma Hayek. ( Loved her here, but loved her more in Frida)
