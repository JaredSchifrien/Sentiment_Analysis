This movie was sooo cute. I'm definitely getting it when it comes out on DVD. It had a few funny moments, and I think it was sweet how Adam Sandler kept trying and trying because he loved her so much. Sandler was great, as usual, and Drew Barrymore is rather beautiful in this flic. All in all, it was a sweet, romantic comedy.
