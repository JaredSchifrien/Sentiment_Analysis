This is my all-time favourite movie, along with The Mummy Returns. Great special effects and lots of laughs coming out of this one. I havent seen a better movie, and the best thing is there is no gory bits and pieces for me to puke on.I hope this movie becomes a classic, you cant get a better thriller than this. And my love for this movie may have been caused by an equal interest in Egypt. A great movie for the whole family!
