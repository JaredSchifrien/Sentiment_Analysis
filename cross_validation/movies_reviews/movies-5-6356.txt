Arguably the best acting performance in the history of American cinema Marlon Brando plays Terry Malloy with such vigor it's impossible to stop watching. His intensity is equalled only by the delicacy in his performance, particulary in the classic scene with his brother Charlie. This film about guilt and redemption is up there with the greatest films of all time.
