This is one of the best low-budget films i have ever seen. not only does the movie keep right on going in this bizzare yet pefect blend of horror and comedy that keeps your eyes glued to the t.v. screen, this movie has great dialouge and surprisingly good acting. I neglected to mention its incredible ending, the perfect ending for the perfect movie. highly recomended. a definate classic.
