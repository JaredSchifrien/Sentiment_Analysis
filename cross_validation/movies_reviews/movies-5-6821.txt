One of the funniest movies ever made. It has that marvelous quality of having jokes and gags that by all rights shouldn't be funny, but for some reason make you laugh so hard you fear to foul your pants. Not many people realize that a lot of the film is a parody of Ingmar Bergman's _The Seventh Seal_. For some extra laughs, watch the Bergman first: then when you watch the Grail, pay special attention to bring out your dead, the flagellants, and the witch scene. Absolute masterpiece.
