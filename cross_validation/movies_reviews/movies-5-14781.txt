I loved this movie. I recently rented it and it was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The setting of this movie is wonderful. It takes place in a small french village and it is absolutely beautiful; it made me wish I was there. This movie had a great message to it, and the differences in the characters was enlightening.
