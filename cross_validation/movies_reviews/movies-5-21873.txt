Back to the Future is one of my favorite movies and has become an American classic. The obvious problems and conflicts that arise with traveling back in time from 1985 to 1955 become obvious in Back to the Future. That whole idea of time travel is captured well. This is probably Michael J. Fox's best performance. Marty McFly, what a character. Him singing Johnny B. Goode back in the '50s is awesome.
