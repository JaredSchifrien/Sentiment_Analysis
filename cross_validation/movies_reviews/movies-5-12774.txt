I don't have to watch a Michael Moore film or any major news network to confirm what I already think of George Bush. All I have to do is look at my own country and see that a convicted serial rapist (Iorworth Hoare) won 7million in a lottery win, students in serious debt, messed up travel and ask where my prime minister Tony Blair is to address these problems and realise hes too busy supporting a man who uses his power as an excuse to exploit and invade other countries that didn't pose a single threat to his in the first place. I don't have to ask myself if the war in Iraq was justified all I have to do is look at the death toll and the anger of many soldiers and their families who now question the mis-leading information they were given to invade a country. Whoever makes the choice not to see this film is obviously scared of certain facts that are being presented to them. Whilst I make it a habit to apologise for certain posts in the event of not offending anyone I won't be apologising for this one as its about time we faced reality that the incomptent and social inept who is now present in the oval office has single-handedly assisted himself in making not only fantastic viewing in a documentary that he starred in, but also some of the biggest blunders in political history.
