Have given this movie a five because it gives you what you want - a funny, engaging, film that leaves you satisfied that you paid your money to watch. With some movies you are waiting for the laughs to materialise but this film has a high quota, both visual and in the dialogue and some clever editing/storytelling to keep the plot moving apace. In this film you start off liking the characters and by the end you are rooting for them in all their travails in life, be it retrieving the sex video or getting laid. There are some funny subplots too such as Tom Green's attempt to feed the snake and the girl's trip to Boston instead of Austin. The writers have used the premise of If we could do anything we wanted and get away with it what would we do? and so we see the theft of a Blind School's bus, an all-black fraternity house, masturbation, and car jumping. It's all good fun and so I would recommend to watch this film....although not with your parents!
