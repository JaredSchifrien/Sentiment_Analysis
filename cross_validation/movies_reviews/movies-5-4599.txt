Somewhat different from the book, yet the main points were there. It has a different director than the first two movies in the series, so of course the pacing is going to be different. I enjoyed it. It was entertaining, and fun to watch. I would have liked to see them do more with Harry's new broom, and the aniesty he felt while waiting for it to be approved by the school. Hermione's time traveling to attend two classes at the same time could have been better shown. But overall, it was a pretty good flick.
