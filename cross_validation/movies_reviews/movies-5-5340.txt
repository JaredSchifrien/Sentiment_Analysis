This is one of my favorite movies. The portrayal of innocence by Scout and her coming to terms with the ways of the world is well done. Gregory Peck is perfect as her father, Atticus Finch, a lawyer who stands up for what's right even though the whole town is against him. It is a highly inspiring story!
