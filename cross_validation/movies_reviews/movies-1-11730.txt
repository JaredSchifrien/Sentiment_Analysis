After seeing Bring it On, I couldn't imagine a teen movie being any worse. I was proven wrong by this dreck. I honestly don't think I laughed a single time in this horrible movie. Too much profanity, disrespectful attitudes, sterotypes, illegal acts being glorfied and in the end, well, it shouldn't have ended that way. This is why I tape high-quality TV (Frasier, Cosby Show, Happy Days) more than modern comedy movies. For a movie called Sugar Spice, there isn't much sweet about this movie.
