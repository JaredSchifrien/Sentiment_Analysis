A supremely tragic love story. One of the greatest of all time. Wonderful score. Surreal winter scenes. All classic movies get their distinction by the fact that the casting is so superb. So it is with Dr. Zhivago , an epic tale of love, hate, betrayal, et al, during the Russian Revolution. Julie Christie absolutely lights up the screen, and Rod Stieger, Omar Shariff, and Geraldine Chaplin turn in admirable performances. Have seen this about a dozen times.
