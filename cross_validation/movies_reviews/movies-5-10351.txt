A fantastic movie about a recent retiree (Nicholson) who is looking back on his life while facing his final years. Parts of the story are told through letters Nicholson writes to a child in Africa that he is sponsoring, which adds a nice touch to the movie. Kathy Bates steals every scene where she appears in her supporting role.
