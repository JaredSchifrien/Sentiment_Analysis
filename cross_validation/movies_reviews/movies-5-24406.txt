I just saw this movie with my friends and we laughed histerically throughout the whole thing! I am not too good w/ names...so I dont remeber the casts names but I know the stars of the movie...there was David Duchovny (howeva u spell it), from X-Files and there is the cute new star Sean William Scott. he is very SeXy!...hehe and then there is Orlando Jones...now he is histerical! Now this movie is like a ghostbusters..its a comedy adventure! Even Dan Ackroyd had a part in it! All of the monsters are very interesting! Its really well done!! Oh goodness there was this 1 part where Orlando Jones got a alien bug in his body (u may hav seen the previews) And he had to have it pulled out and he had this funi walk 4 a lil while...hahaha It was sooo funni!!!! +Neway I dont wanna give away ne more of this movie.....Just go c I recommend it! : o )
