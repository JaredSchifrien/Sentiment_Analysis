I love Roberto Benigni! I think he is so funny. I am sure some people find him too hyperactive but I do not mind. It might take a few minutes to get use to his style. The plot: A Jewish man falls for a beautiful woman Nicoletta Braschi using his humour he captures her heart, the heart of his son, and the movie viewer. You truly see how the power of love and hope exists during the most trying of conditions in Nazi concentration camps. It is a movie that will stay with you. If you like Roberto Benigni.. I also liked the movie Johnny Stecchino.
