My parents always made it a point to buy my brother, sister and I many of the older Disney movies on tape so we could experience Disney as they did. Sleeping Beauty will always be my favorite. The villain in this movie is like none else, and the characters are amazing too. What most impressed me, and continues to now that I'm not a child, is the quality of the animation and how you just don't get that in todays animated movies. Many of the backgrounds were painted by hand. Not only that, but the songs still stand the test of time as well. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
