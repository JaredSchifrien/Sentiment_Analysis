This is my favorite movie of all time, because it's the ONLY movie that ever scared me! For the time period it was made it's still a great horror flick today! My favorite scene is when the girl is possesed and sleeping and her mom comes in to see her and on her stomach is scratched Help Me . The most disgusting parts are the throw-up scene, and the scene where she stabs her private with the upside down cross and rubs her mom's face in it, but I loved it still.
