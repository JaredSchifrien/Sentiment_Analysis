I rented this on DVD recently. It had been years since I'd seen it. We roared through most of it... Paul Newman gave a great tongue-in-cheek performance. One of the great benefits of the DVD format is the special features. One cool thing that I learned was that the film was based on the real-life Carlson Brothers...hockey maniacs. Two of the three "Hanson Brothers" in the film WERE Jeff and Steve Carlson...the guys who inspired the film. Want a great laugh? "Slap Shot" is one of the great sleeper comedies of all time.
