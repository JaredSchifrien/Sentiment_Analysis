Normally a fan of action movies, I was skeptical about watching Dead Poets Society. After I did, however, I found it to be an amazing movie with a great plot and many lessons to be learned. It hits close to home with alot of people on points of opression, peer pressure, and just plain being yourself. Robin Williams did a stellar job of portraying the very enthusiastic and very individual Mr. Keating, who's teachings lead a group of restless and discontented teens to reinstate the Dead Poets Society, where they read literature from the past few centuries. The lessons taught in this film are based upon the Transcendentalist views of famous writers such as Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. It urges viewers to be free from the constraints of society and from the opression of worrying what others think. This movie is perhaps the best-written and acted movie I have ever seen. If you have not yet seen this movie, I strongly urge you to do so.
