Sandra Bullock should be a teacher..! I really didn't think she had it in her. Simply due to the fact that she's such a pretty a lady. I hate to say it but I was impressed with Sandra's fighting abilities in this one. She could certainly well instruct the girls in the latest rendition of Charlie's Angels . Credibility ...! The producers of this motion picture aren't treating the audience like a bunch of stupid - gullable nerds...in other words. But the producers of Charlie's Angels seems to think we, as an audience will buy anthing they throw at us. Thanks to the producers of Miss Congenialtiy . And umm Sandra ....will you be a bit more careful from now on ......cause you're a really kewl lookin girl. Get my drift?
