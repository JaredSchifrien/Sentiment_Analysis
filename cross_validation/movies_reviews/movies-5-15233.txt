One of Pacino's all time classic permormances. A simple film set largley on location, ie the bank, the film which could have ended up turgid and monotonous due to its long periods of inactivity and its very simplicity ends up vibrant and gripping due soley to an all time great performance by pacino. The phone call sceans act as a kinda microcosm of the film. The camera zooms in on Pacino, escaping the madness of the crowd outside and the media hoopla as Sonny talks to his two wives . Again, had we been watching a lesser actor the sceane would have dragged and been extruciatingly dull. As it turns out Pacino makes the sceans among the greatest moments in cinama history, IMO. Acting masterclass.
