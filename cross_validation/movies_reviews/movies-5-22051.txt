WEEEEE-HEEE HE HEEE!! Cameron at his best and havin' a ball! Well acted, brilliantly directed, and very, very tense. Great fun watching all the marines getting creamed by what has to be the MEANEST creatures to feature in any sci-fi film. What I like about Cameron's sci-fi is that all the characters settings are believable hang together well, so that you feel this really is taking place somewhere - you really get immersed in it all. Loud, fast, eye-popping, terrifying, exhilarating - one of the best.
