James and The Giant Peach is an extremly well done movie based on the hit children's novel written by Roald Dahl. It's about a young boy named James, whose parents are eaten by a hippo in the sky, and his 2 evil aunts are left to take care of him. He finds a giant peach, that he goes into, and he makes friends with a group of giant bugs. It may sound, weird but this movie is great.
