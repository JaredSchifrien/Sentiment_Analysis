Not only is this a film with all the trappings of a good romantic comedy (there's a little suspense, there's a few unexpected twists and turns, but best of all there's the certainty that it will all work out in the end), but it has the added value of being set in the 80s - Rubix cubes? New Coca-cola? Sweat bands? Bring 'em on! A really sweet film to cuddle up to, and some fun music along the way.
