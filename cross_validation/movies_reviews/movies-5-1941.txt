This movie was utterly terrifying!!! It's not like the slasher movies that we normally think of when someone suggests a thriller, but it preys on the viewer psychologically. Sometimes that's even more frightening than the blood and gore. This movie was powerful and so scary I can't even look at a river and a forest now without getting a chill.
