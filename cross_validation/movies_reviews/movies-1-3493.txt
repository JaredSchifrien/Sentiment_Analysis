I tire of these exercises in trying to look as cool as possible. This movie has no backbone and seems like it was just throw together in order to get some cool poster shots and gratuitous nudity. Not that there's anything wrong with gratutious nudity but nothing about this film is done with any hint of style. Rob Coen needs to direct porn films, I'm sure his style would make more sense in that field. Best Scene: the gratutious nudity
