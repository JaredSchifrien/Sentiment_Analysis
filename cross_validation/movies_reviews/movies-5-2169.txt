I saw this when it first came out and I didn't really appreciate it - but I was 16. I then decided to buy it on video and god am I glad that I did. This has a tremendous cast - as told by antondatree (he forgot Natalie Portman though) You really do have to sit down and concentrate on this film otherwise you won't really get whats happening. I loved the music running in the background and then I found out that it was Moby 'God Moving Over Waters' This is a very powerful fim and the two main actors are the best in the industry. Its fabulous.
