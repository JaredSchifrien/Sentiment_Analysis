Taking the risk of making someone angry, i have to say that i prefer the movie to the book - maybe because i saw the movie first- but i thought that the book was a bit boring. i have finally read all 3 books and have to say that my favourite is the last one. As for the the fellowship of the ring - movie, i really liked it. the cast, the location ( new zealand is amazing!), the adaptation of the story - it s very good, pure magic and entertainment.
