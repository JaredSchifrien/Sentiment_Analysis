What a neat movie. Tom Hanks did a terrific job as Forrest Gump a man who does not have a lot of smarts but a huge heart. I loved how events of his life tied in with meeting about four presidents. Forrest has always loved Jenny since childhood they grew up best friends. Their lives take different paths.Forrest succeeds in everything he does, he is the best runner on the football team, He was a hero during the vietnam war, He ran a shrimping busy in honor of his friend Bubba and ending up being a millionaire.etc. He met presidents and was awarded by them for different reasons many times. The movie has a lot of great special effects. putting Tom Hanks in films with real presidents, Making it appear That Dan had no legs. I like the fact that a a person like Forrest who is not very smart but a very kind caring person.falls upon success in everything he does yet money and fame mean little to him just finding Jenny[who had fallen on bad times} and being with her is what is important,I loved how he was a devoted friend, to Jenny, his mom. Bubba, and DAn.A little bit too long but a great movie.
