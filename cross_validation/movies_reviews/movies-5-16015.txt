Wow no one has reviewed this great movie yet. And I wasn't planning on writing one, but I guess I will anyway. It has great style, a great story, great characters, and good acting. This movie managed to be very funny thoughout all the seriousness. Some of the story eliments though are already a little runned down (i.e. a scene depicting what it's like to be on a drug, and an obligatory leaving on an airplane scene), but it manages to do them well. And the rest of the movie definitely makes up for it... and last but not least, I love the music in this movie.
