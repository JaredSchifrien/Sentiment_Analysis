I am not a huge Star Wars fan, but when I went to go see Revenge Of the Sith I was amazed by all it had to offer. The special effects along with the scenery was excellent. I enjoyed the acting very much. This movie really dishes out all emotions. I love the part where Obi Wan and Anakin are battling it out and at the same time Yoda and the evil chancellor are fighting as well. This movie has a ton of action and gets really sad as Anakin destroys everything so great with just one poor decision. Hes that character you love to hate. Go see this movie.
