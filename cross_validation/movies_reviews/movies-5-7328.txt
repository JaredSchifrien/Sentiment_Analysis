Released in 1999 and directed by Mike Judge (of Beavis and Butthead and King of the Hill fame), Office Space is a somewhat dark, comical, spot-on satire of the modern white-collar business environment. Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) is a computer programmer who goes through a change in philosophy and starts to act out his true apathy towards his job, which spills over to some of his co-workers (David Herman and Ajay Naidu). His bland job is also reflected in his bland social life, namely an average apartment and eating at average restaurants. Oddly enough, this new outlook gives him the courage to ask out an attractive waitress (Jennifer Aniston) who is suffering from work apathy as well and to speak his mind to a pair of efficiency experts who have been hired to downsize the company resulting in an unexpected promotion. Besides the absurdity of the everyday, what makes this film work is Livingston's intentionally flat performance which suggests the inertia and hopelessness of his situation, Stephen Root's portrayal of Milton the invisible and ignored employee, Gary Cole as the robotic boss, and the soundtrack which features rap and other music that seemingly runs contrary to the sterile environment that the film examines. The bottom line is that Office Space is an extremely funny yet poignant film examining contemporary office politics.
