Aside for the nostalgia for the timeless Disney characters and the stunning animation, there was some great humor present as well. I loved the Fantasia reference Mickey cracked when he said, It would take a sorceror to clean up this mess! Wise-cracking reindeer are always funny, as are Donald's destructive rampages. Oh, and the Santa Claus line, Let's see the Tooth Fairy do that! after landing on the roof of a house reminded me of my stories where Santa and the Tooth Fairy are teamed up. Of course, there were good messages as well and no objectionable content.
