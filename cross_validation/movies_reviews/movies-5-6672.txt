OK, THIS IS IT! The new Cheaper by the Dozen was not a remake of the original. They are nothing alike and the Steve Martin movie IMO was a total flop. The original Cheaper by the Dozen is my number one favorite comedy movie. It is a true story about a family with 12 children. Clifton Webb, a very fine old actor, plays Frank Gilbreth, the father (who was a well know efficiency expert). If you haven't seen this movie, please give yourself a couple of hours of sheer quality entertainment and get it. I promise you will not be disappointed.
