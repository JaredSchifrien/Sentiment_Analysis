The two stars in this classic story of unrequited love are terrific...never were they better than in this film. Joan Fontaine is the hopelessly in love woman with Louis Jourdan, a true cad and ladies' man. The film has its intensely romantic moments but the end result is one of great sacrifice and tragedy. Max Ophuls direction is excellent.
