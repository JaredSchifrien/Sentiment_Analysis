I think this is one of the bravest films to be released in a long time. Done quite lovingly, the artistry is fantastic and the acting shines even though done in Latin and Aramiac. However to say this film is not for everyone would be a huge understatement. The graphic violence and gore is truly shocking but I certainly don't think it was gratuitous. Mel Gibson set out to make Passion accurately and not gloss over Christ's suffering. The accusations of anti-semitism is ridiculous-anyone who has researched that time period knows who ordered Christ to die. I applaud Gibson for not straying from his vision to please certain groups of people. I myself am not a religious person and I was moved intensely by this film. You feel every aspect of Christ's agony along with him. It is a film I will remember for the rest of my life and I highly recommend it but only for those with an iron-clad stomach.
