No other music movie of the last twenty-five years has had such an enduring impact. With my older sister playing the record over and over when I was a kid, I learned the lyrics to the entire soundtrack and can still sing along to every song. The acting is strong and the singing excellent, particularly considering that it was actors who did the singing. If you get a chance to check out a stage production of Grease, do yourself a favor and do so. You'll recognize most of the songs, but there will be a couple which will be new.
