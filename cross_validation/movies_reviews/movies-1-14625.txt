How did this movie garner so much critical acclaim? Furthermore, how could this movie be so bad when it had so many fine actors? The plot moved way too slowly for my taste. I found myself not caring about any of the characters, (they weren't very likable) which caused me not to care about what happened in the movie. One of the worst films I've ever seen.
