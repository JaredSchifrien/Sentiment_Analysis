There may be other versions that are more true to the book, use more realistic or hideous makeup, special effects, have better sets, and locations. But I still respect this one as the first successful attempt to bring Shelley s very original and imaginative morality play to the screen. Boris Karloff was also very adept at showing us the confused anger as well as the sympathetic side of the monster using only facial expressions and body language. And who doesn t think of this classic makeup artistry when you hear the word Frankenstein? In the 70+ years since this movie was produced the familiar square head, stitches, bolts, tacky suit and big shoes have become more than a costume in an old movie they have entered the realm of American film folklore. I m sure there will be more productions of this story in the future, and some will no doubt be very well done - but I don t think any will ever totally eclipse the first.
