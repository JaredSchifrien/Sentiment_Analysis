I never tire of this film. Excellent cast, although a little over the top in some scenes. Good plot and uplifting ending, which I really liked. And, oh, if ya love cats you'll love this flick! The naming of cats is really a big job for one of the characters in this film! If you'd like to hear T.S. Elliot being recited in a motion pic, gotta see this one!
