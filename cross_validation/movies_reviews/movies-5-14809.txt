I was amazed at how funny and disturbing this movie was. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen, for the message it sends. For those that believe it glorifies drug use, you are CRAZY. I showed this movie to my kids in the effort to give them the best anti-drug message (apart from Requiem for a Dream) they will ever see. Yes, drugs feel good and we shouldn't shy away from telling our kids this or they will not trust what we tell them. The message is that the costs of those good feelings are not worth it, not at all. I was also amazed at what we in America consider to be impovershed, our standards are quite high compared to Scotland! HUD housing in America would be considered luxurious there.
