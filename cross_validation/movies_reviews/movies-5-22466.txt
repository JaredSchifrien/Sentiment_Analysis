The best Star Trek movie ever made. This film re-introduces Kirk to an enemy from his past (and the original series as well). Ricardo Montalban plays his role as the insane Khan excellently. William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy are in surprisingly good form, and supported by the usual cast. If you are not a trekie, this is the movie you want to see. If you are a trekie, this should be your favorite. Unlike most Star Trek films, and episodes, this film actually has battle scenes, and is rather entertaining.
