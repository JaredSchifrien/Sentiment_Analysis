 King Kong is the film from which the action/adventure epic was born. From it's dazzling special effects, (for there time, although they do hold up quite well today) to the ambitious-ness of it's story, Kong was (and is) entertainment at its best, particularly in a time when the world was in dire need of it. DEFINATELY one of my all-time favorites!
