Star Wars gets a 5 star rating from me. I can remember my dad packing my family up in the car to drive an extra 40 minutes into downtown San Diego so that we could see Star Wars on what was then the biggest screen in the area and boy was it worth it. At 10 and 8 years old my brother and I went insane for Star Wars, it was by far the greatest thing we'd ever seen on the big screen or anywhere else for that matter. Empire was good too, but Star Wars was so new and so different from anything we'd seen before. It is so basic, the fight between good and evil, a really basic story that has been explored and explored in film and was rejuvinated in the new setting of a galaxy far, far away. I think the film was wonderfully cast with each of the lead characters being spunky and powerful but just vulnerable enough to keep us rooting for them. I really can't say a bad thing about it, it was genius for its time.
