I love this movie! It's one of my favorites. It's a very haunting and disturbing film in some ways, but overall it is an excellent human drama. The performances are awesome- I think it includes some of Winona Ryder's best work and of course Angelina Jolie was simply amazing and disturbingly natural as sociopath Lisa. The story has a timeless quality- it could've easily taken place today because the world is just as crazy and screwed up as it was back in the late 1960s. The supporting actors were great too, from Whoopi Goldberg to Brittney Murphy (Daisy is a hoot, of course until she does the obvious later on in the film) to Jared Leto and Vanessa Redgrave, in addition to the various young actresses who played the other patients in the ward. It has some very funny scenes, yet I get tears in my eyes watching other parts, like when the burned girl Polly looks at a picture of herself when she was younger and before she burned herself. I don't think it's just a chick flick - it's an awesome movie and story everyone can somehow relate to! See this movie ASAP!
