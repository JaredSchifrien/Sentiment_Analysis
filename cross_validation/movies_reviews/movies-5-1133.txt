 Say hello to my little friend. If you don't know where that came from you are not from this planet. Whether you hated the movie or loved it you know that came from Tony Montana(Al Pacino). This movie made everybody want to be Scarface. It has it all; action, drama, and the American dream. A true movie masterpiece.
