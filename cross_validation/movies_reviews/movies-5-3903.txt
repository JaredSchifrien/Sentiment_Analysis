Well before I donned my first pair of Mouse Club ears, I considered myself a life-long fan of Empire Disney. That sincere devotion included everything from Disneyland to my Mickey Mouse watch. Yet, for a very long span of years, I had all but given up on ever being truly entertained by one of their feature length cartoons. While I felt the Disney creative geniuses never really lost their edge or ability to produce high quality, state of the art animated films, for awhile that was all they really had - the form without the substance. Then came The Lion King and I had to completely re-evaluate my position. I know there were some critically acclaimed films preceding this one by a few years, but not since the days before the death of Walt Disney (1966) had I seen it all come together in such a winning combination of beautiful music, classic compelling story, drama and humor. The selection of voices for the animal characters was also excellent and Jeremy Irons in particular was a standout as the embittered, evil Scar. I still crack up when I think of his droll delivery of the line You have nooo idea! I was not in the least surprised when I heard it had been turned into a successful live musical as well. The Lion King is an excellent addition to either adult or children's video collection.
