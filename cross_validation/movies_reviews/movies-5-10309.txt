I think this is a great movie . I have seen this so many times I know it word for word through the whole movie and I can do the fast-talking sequence ( what you wouldn't read about is how ray finkle lost his mind was committed to a mental hospital only to escape and join the police force under the assumed identity of a missing hiker manipulating his way to the top in a diabolical scheme to get even with Dan Marino who he blamed for the entire thing ) faster than Jim Carrey in the movie and yet I still laugh at the jokes. My favourite part is when Ace turns up at Ray Finkles house and says hi, I'm looking for Ray Finkle then a shotgun is pointed to is head. He replies and a clean pair of shorts . And when asked over the phone by Courtney Cox where he is , he says I'm in Phsychoville and Finkle's the Mayor . All in all one of Carreys best performances. The sequel was crap.
