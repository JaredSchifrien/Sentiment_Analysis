This is indeed Peter's crowning accomplishment, JRR would be proud! The cinematography is superb, cast is outstanding, scenery is marvelous, special effects are awesome, and gathering of three different paths in the story line is perfect. Following the lineage of the Kings/Stewards line was accurate and poignant. The other two lines of the Hobbiton folk and filled with anxiety, drama and of course warmth. Going into the theater I was concerned that a 3:20 movie might take its toll. I was quite pleased that I didnt even notice the time. I cant wait for the 5 hour box set.
