The movie is rather bland, with sparse moments of weak laughter to break the drawn out moments of predictable and dull events. I was all hyped up by the commercials that looked so promising, and then utterly disappointed when I left the theater (which I shouldnt have even entered) after 115 minutes of infantilizing (and somewhat sleazy) humor and awkward, repetitious dialogue (ok, I get it 8 out of 10 women think that the first kiss is important. Let it go already). Youd think a movie with Will Smith and Kevin James would be hilarious, but not even the best of actors can make this clich√© laden script work on the screen. Best see another movie instead.
