Incredible movie. Works best for fans of the 'Firefly' series, but the movie should be thoroughly enjoyable for almost any fan of sci-fi. The character development and writing is miles ahead of what George Lucas has done with the Star Wars series since 'The Empire Strikes Back'. Deserves a shot @ becoming a franchise...
