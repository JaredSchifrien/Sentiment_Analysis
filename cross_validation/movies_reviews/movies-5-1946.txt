A classic. What could be scarier than being pursued in the wilderness by a group of bloodthirsty, rapist rednecks? The soundtrack of this movie had such a profound effect on me that every time I see a confederate flag, one of those long in the back / short on the side haircuts, or other symbols of a redneck, I hear Dueling Banjos in my mind... Squeal like a piggy, boy - now that is terror.
