This film is only for Jim Carrey. Who could play this role Charlie/Hank except Jim? The hard words were just cute...Renee Zellweger was cute too. Irene P. Waters was the very different image prepared to that role in Jerry Maguire. She showed she could even keep up with Jim Carrey. Her charm in this film was enough to attract his instinct...
