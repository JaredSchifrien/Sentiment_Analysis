It's a shame comedies like this are so rarely made anymore - clever, warm-hearted, and funny throughout. I still think, Over? Over? Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell, no! is one of the funniest lines in cinema, delivered as it was by a guy who really should not have been in college to start with.
