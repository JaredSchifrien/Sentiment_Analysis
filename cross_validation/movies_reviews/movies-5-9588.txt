Enjoyed book. Thought film would be disappointment. Wrong. Enough twists to keep even most adamant fans of novel surprised. A Bridget who seemed unlikely at first, but came to be real Bridget by end of film. Laughed my way through it. Renee's accent a little bizarre, but adds comedy itself. Her Bridget really is v. good character, full of humour and truth. Hugh surprised all with character seemed made for him, without any of usual nervous twittering that is so famous for. Colin Firth looked v. shaggable in suit. See film if want v. English rom com.
