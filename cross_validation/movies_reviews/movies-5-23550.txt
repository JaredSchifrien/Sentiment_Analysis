There were three main versions of this movie: the original 1956 classic; the equally great and extra-creepy 1978 version; and the disgusting and bad '93 version, simply called The Body Snatchers. I highly recommend the first two versions; prime cut and very effective and thought-provoking SF. The '78 version has some really great and creepy sound design, too, a wild who's who cast, and the best ending of the three.
