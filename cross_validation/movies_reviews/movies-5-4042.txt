This movie is a true Disney classic. It has all the aspects; cute and lovable characters, an evil character (aunt sarah), the love story and of course, the happy ending. The art work is excellent, all the characters are drawn in true Disney fashion, making sure that the bodies of the dogs and people are proportioned. The love scene between Lady and the Tramp is very cute and sweet too. This is by far my favorite disney movie, as it has been for 18 years!
