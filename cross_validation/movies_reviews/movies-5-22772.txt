What a wonderful family movie. I saw this for the first time almost 20 years ago in one of those huge theaters they used to have. A moving, funny, story about a boy and his friedship with an extra terrestrial. who is named E.T. the three children in the family try to keep E.T.a secret. After a short while E.T. wants to go home.so the kids try to find a way for him to communicate with his planet. Of course when they find that way the public finds out about E.T. and tries to take him so they can experiment on him.the kids and friends have to find a way to rescue E.T. and get him to the ship. this is just a real feel good movie about the friendship between E.T. and Elliot. All the kid actors are good. Drew Barrymore was adorable. this movie had me laughing.and crying.A well done movie.
