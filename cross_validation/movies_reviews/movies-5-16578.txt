This movie made me go awwwwww!!!! I love those sweetheart movies! It was so beautifully done, and the NYC/SF setting was so romantic, and both Cusak and Beckinsale were incredible! I laughed so hard at that guy who worked at Bloomingdales, and at Molly Shannon's character....oh yeah and at that little kid in the devil costume in the elevator trying to disrupt fate! Oh, you've gotta see it for yourself! WHAT A SWEET MOVIE!!!! :)
