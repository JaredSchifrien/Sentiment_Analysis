Absolutely hysterical. It stars Ron Livingston, Gary Cole Jennifer Aniston. Ron plays a guy who just doesn't like going to work....so he decides simply not to go anymore. One of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's written by Mike Judge (Beavis Butthead) and based on the comic strip Milton. Highly reccomended.
