This movie was actually more retarded than I had expected. The scene with the coconuts and Hurleys tits was like HUH, are you fugging serious! SOUTH PARK is 1000 times more stupid and crude and funny than this piece of dumbsh*t. In fact, Mike Myers is only funny in SNL. HyperHypo, Man. Now thats funny,harharharhar.....youpatheticfools.
