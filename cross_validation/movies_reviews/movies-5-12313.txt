This was an excellent movie. Okay, Travolta calls up the same corny southern accent he used in Primary Colors. But it's refreshing to watch a film that assumes that you're literate, and promotes learning as a virtue. The colors and the emotions of the cinematography is overwhelming. Later, when Katrina hit, I found myself wondering what happened to that house. Great performances by all.
