This movie was incredible. I saw it in the theater when it first came out, and was amazed, not only at the special effects, but also at the acting. I strongly disagree with those that say this movie had a weak storyline and weak acting. Every actor and actress in The Mummy was talented, gifted, and played their parts well. They also brought comedy into the movie with jokes when the tension was high. The sexy bander between Brendan and Rachel kept the movie in perspective when things were getting over the top. I suppose you would have to have a genuine interest in Egypt and the ancient cultures to appreciate this film. It was not only worth the $7.00 to see it in the theater, but also the $15.00 to buy it on VHS.
