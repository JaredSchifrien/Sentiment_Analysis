This movie just about has everything I do not like in a movie. The characters are anything but upbeat and optimistic. The world that the movie set in has no creative flair--not even a stylized chair can be seen. Dramatic movies should be good vs. evil, with the lines clearly drawn, but this one certaintly isn't. There's gory violence, gobs of coarse language, and sexual material as well. The topic of the movie is also highly disturbing and anything but friendly. Finally, the ending is anything but happy, with a blissful ignorance of justice or the law.
