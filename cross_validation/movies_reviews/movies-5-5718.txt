Only those north of the Mason-Dixon line fail to understand why we Southerner's love this movie. Despite a generation of dispargers, this movie remains one of the greatest of all time. The casting is excellent, the actors are probably the most excellently cast of any movie. The storyline is a little weak, as only the stereotyped southern ninny in Scarlett would fail to see that Rhett has qualities far beyond the wimpy Ashley. I want to give her a good shaking every time I see this movie.The sets and lighting are excellent. A throughly good movie.
