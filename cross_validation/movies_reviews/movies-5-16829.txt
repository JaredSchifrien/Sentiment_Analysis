i think that the movie is really romantic. and i think that it carries the idea. sometimes person can only achieve happiness when he stops caring about the routine and pay attention to more important things, like love. the idea of the movie is that sara deaver has a mission. every month she starts a new relationship trying to make a person better and after one month she dumps him and lives her own life. keanu tries to hold her forever but he doesnt know her secret. the secret is that she is very sick(cancer) he still wants to be with her and take care of her, cuz he loves her deeply. and she doesnt want him to suffer because of her, she wants him to remember her strong and beautiful. cuz she also loves him madly. so its the story of two people who are so in love with each other that can sacrifice their own happiness for the sake of other. at times the movie is very funny, especially in the beginning when he didnt like her and she was bothering him, so he finally fell. thats how you hit on guys, i told myself. the really strong point is that she made him fall for her without being a whore and seducing him. it happened naturally, and by the end of november sara became nelsons world and he couldnt live without her. i think keanu reeves and charlize theron match together( remember the devils advocate).ok if you are still awake, i would like to say that if you read to this point you are definitely dying of boredom so i just say that i give my strongest recommendations for sweet november. its worthy of watching and writing about.
