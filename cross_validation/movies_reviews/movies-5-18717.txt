One of my favorites. Although I think Keanu sux in just about everything he does and I also think the same about Wynona Ryder, the movie had such a great script and Gary Oldman is an incredible actor, that it was worth seeing at the theatre. Copola did an excellent job of direction (look what he had to struggle w/ though).
