What a good horror movie. This along with the much better and scarier Halloween, started the teen horror revolution. This is by far one of the best classic 80's teen slash films of the decade. Shot well at an actual summer camp and consisting of a lightly talented cast(Kevin Bacon being the only one to go anywhere.He also has a startling scene in a speedo. )and an original idea for the time a kind of switch on the psycho idea and at a summer camp rather than a motel. Gruesome effects by the master Tom Savini also give this movie an extra boost. You cannot deny how cool that girl looks with that axe freshly buried into her youthful face or the realism of the the early on throat slitting if the counsler who never makes it to camp. Cool idea, cool deaths,led to a funny and entertaining franchise, led to Jason(who is only second to MichaelMyers of Halloween.)and helped Kevin Bacon start a career!Recommended. See it before camp counsling or camping. hehe. Has Callmetootie even seen this movie? There is like one boob in the whole movie! Far from spending alot of time on female nudity. But tootie got the Gorefest part right! Brains and guts? I must have missed that in the several trillion times I've seen this movie. I still love ya. HOORAY!
