THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME! I can't believe people on this website criticized it! It is my most Fave movie and has been for years. It's one you can never get sick of and if you've never seen it I'll personally make you(literally, i bought it for my friend for Christmas cuz she hadn't seen it) Anyway, Its a movie you'll quote constantly, for intance, just today I said to my friend I expected the Rocky Mountains to be a little Rockier than this! So, I have seen this movie so many times that I have seriously memorized it...word for word! Me n my bf love! Pappy and Frappy 4 life!
