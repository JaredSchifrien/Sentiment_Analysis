Two comedy giants at the height of their powers sharing a magical chemistry between themselves. The scene where Steve Martin's character lets loose an obscenity laced tirade at a smiling rental car agent (played by Edie McClurg) and her response to him is hysterical. This oddly matched pair is forced to share the same space for a period of long days leaving Martin's character frustrated and edgy. Their quest to get home in time for Thanksgiving is finally resolved following an outrageous series of misadventures. The precurser to the Chris Farley-David Spade pairings but on a more adult level. A must see film.
