A virtually underrated film. Perhaps it wasn't well recieved in it's day because of it's dark tone that is not often associated with musicals. But Roy Schieder is amazing and Jessica Lange haunting. Schieder's main supporting characters, Leland Smith and Anne Reinking literally steal the show. The two faboulous dancers are just outstanding from dance number to dance number. And the final number......gosh, that final sequence still gives me the chills and makes me teary eyed everytime.
