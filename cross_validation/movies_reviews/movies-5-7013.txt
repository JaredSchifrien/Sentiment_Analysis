Ferris Bueller is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is a bona fide American classic. Amazingly, that is the way all teenagers feel: how can I get out of going to school today? It is indescribable how funny it is when Ben Stein playing the teacher is standing in front of the class repeating Bueller, Bueller, Bueller, in his monotonous voice. Another great part of the movie is when the principal thinks that Ferris is calling the school and insults the person on the other line. Ferris tries to mellow out his uptight friend, Cameron. The bulk of the movie IS his day off: seeing his father getting into a taxi, going to the Cubs game, singing Twist and Shout with the voice of John Lennon in the middle of a parade float, hurrying home in time so that no one would find out he was feigning illness. When the principal rings the doorbell and it has that recording, you go nuts laughing. A really wonderful movie.
