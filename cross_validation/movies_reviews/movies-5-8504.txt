It seems to me that any one who has ever worked at a crap job at some point in their lives, loves this film. Kevin Smith is by far my favorite writer director. He has a unique and realistic aproach to his films. He keeps it simple and always manages to make a point while making fun of life at the same time. Clerks is in my opinion the best, but the again it is the first film of his I saw which can make a person biased.
