a failed attempt at the antagonist as a protaganist genre. Worse than such cinematic bowel movements as Hannibal or Interview With a Vampire. How can we identify with the main character? Alex was a euro-trash fruitcake in bad '70s threads, and despite the inherent fruity factor, he still managed to be a rapist prick. I personally think he should have been caned on public television until he stopped screaming than brokered to a Russian porn ring and forced to serve fat russian men for the rest of his brief, AIDS-infected existence.
