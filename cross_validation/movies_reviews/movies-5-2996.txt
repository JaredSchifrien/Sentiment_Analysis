Let me start off by saying no action thrillers are realistic. I think people up in here criticizing its lack of realism don't see many movies. As far as action/thriller movies go, I'd have to say this one was pretty damn realistic. And it was a good story. So I will rate this movie a five because it is one of the very few screenplays that truly impresses me. The characters are so dynamic and have so much depth. Especially Redford's character. I've watched it several times now, and finally have begun to pick up some of the fascinating and provacative details (or themes, perhaps). I found it very compelling when I thought about how they made an issue out of Muir having never had much of a meaningful relationship with a woman. Or for that matter getting close to anyone at all. The two things he said to Bishop: 1) put away some money so you can retire someplace warm and don't touch it for anyone, ever ; and 2) if you go off the reservation I will not come after you. As Redford's character ended up doing both for Bishop (giving up his life savings and helping Bishop after he went rogue), it makes you realize Bishop was the only person in the world Muir had ever really cared about. Kinda made me wonder if the reason Redfor's character sold out the girl was really safety because before she came along Bishop just worshipped Muir. Anyway, I found that very compelling; a beautiful theme well disguised as a fast-paced and exciting spy thriller. Random thought: my friends and I occasionally comment on how Redford and Pitt really do look related. Same height, build, hair and eye color and general face-structure. Makes you wonder if they really are related, since Redford seems to like picking Pitt to star in his movies.
