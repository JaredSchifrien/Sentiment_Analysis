 Shawshank is my favorite drama movie of all time. A bit on the long side, but the awesome conclusion makes it all worth it. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver top-notch performances in this feel-good movie. But it's not so feel-good that it's sappy, but just a great good prevailing over evil experience.
