I am so happy to see this film listed! This has to be one of my favorite comedies of all time. Gable and Colbert are absolutely hilarious in this tenderhearted story of a couple meeting by "chance" on a bus, whom soon go through a measure of comedic circumstances, ultimately ending on a wonderful high note. Having been most familiar with Gables later films, its been a delight to have recently been able to see his earlier, comedic films. I thoroughly enjoy his pairing with Crawford, both whom had a natural zest for comedy, and in this movie Colbert and him make a wonderfully witty and delightful pair. If your in the mood to have a great laugh, take a chance on this, one of the best comedies to ever grace the silvers screen!
