Yet another spin on the whole origin of the vampire, yet a new history and a new take on the werewolf origin as well, but at least this one gives the werewolf story abetter beginning than the old and tired wolf bites human makes him a werewolf story. However, the new breed of werevamp is not my fav. I thought they pulled it off well, but surely they could have made him look better than that!! Altogether, I think this movie was great. We can't wait for Evolution!!!
