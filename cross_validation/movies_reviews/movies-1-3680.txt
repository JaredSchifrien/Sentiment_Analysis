Vin Disel makes an effort in this awful action thriller, that looks almost like a TV film. A Man Apart tells the story of a man who loses his wife during a shootout, and then decides to take revenge on the killers. The film drags on for about one hour too long, and the action scenes are overdone. Disel is good, but his action skills are hardly anything special.
