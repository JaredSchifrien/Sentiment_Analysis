I don't care who or why, abortion is murder of a life God created. I am sure there are people who think they are doing good but when it involves the destruction of a human life, the end never justifies the means nor the reason. I have been researching the lives of women who had abortions and you never hear how their lives progress after they decide to kill their babies. Many have lifelong struggles with all sorts of emotional issues. Some can't stand to be around babies because it makes them think of the child they destroyed. Some have relationship problems that last their lifetime. Many become drug or alcohol abusers. No one ever tells them that these things may become a permanent part of their lives after an abortion. Many women have committed suicide from the guilt of killing their baby. Hollywood can glamorize just about anything and people will get that warm fuzzy feeling and say what a wonderful person. She was playing God!
