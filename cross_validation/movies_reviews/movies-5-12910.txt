Truly one of the best movies ever made. I was one of the few who saw it in theatres and feel better for having seen this cinematic masterpiece on the big screen. I've viewed the movie countless times since it was released and i'm still moved beyond words with each screening. Everything else out there is just a movie, this my friends is art.
