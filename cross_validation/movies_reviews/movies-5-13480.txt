This is one of the most amazing movies of our (some of our) childhoods! It show a beautiful portrayal of four innocent boys. The acting is outstanding for these children. They were all around the age of twelve. They all had the lines memorized. This is a feel good movie that sure will get to you in that good way. You feel good for watching it. I just wish movies these days could have such substance. oh well.
