I have never been sodimized with a broomstick and thanks to Dark City, there was no messy clean up. This movie is some 18 years old bathroom fantasy where the reality of life is changed by creepy aliens wearing dead bodies. The only scary thing about this movie is the realization that you are now 1 hour closer to death because you wasted your time.
