And, thus, my streak of picking superb movies to see at the theatre continues. Fantastic Four, The Incredibles, Shrek 2, Sky Captain and the World of Tommorow, Spider-Man 2, Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith and now Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit! Based on the three very amusing (especially "The Wrong Trousers") shorts from Aardman Animation, this british-originated claymation feature hits all the right notes. As many others have said, Gromit steals the show--without saying a word. His expressions say it all. The plot is quite humorous, and although menacing, not excessivly dark. The sense of humor that the movie has is great with awesome puns, great sight gags, some moments that nearly break the fourth wall, and even some mild double entendres. The animation is good, and some of the character designs are exteremely appealing. Overall, this was a throughly enjoyable film!
