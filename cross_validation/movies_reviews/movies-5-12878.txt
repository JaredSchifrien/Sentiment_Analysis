An amazing and life-affirming film. What's more amazing is that it did not win Best Picture the year it was released. It apparently didn't do amazing box office business when it came out but made an incredible comeback when released on video. The title put some people off but word of mouth spread and it became a bonafide blockbuster. Well-deserved. Great ending too.
