A very good remake of a very good series, Scooby-Doo has a talented cast with a variable script. Some of the jokes, including references to the television series, are great, while the fart jokes can be left at the door. Also, cameos from other characters and a great surprise ending make it a five-star. The deleted scenes on the DVD, however, were great and should have been left in!
