I absolutely loved this movie. Plot - mmm, not much. Basically Prince Humpardink is after Princess Buttercup ( great names ). And there is a lot of fantasy from there on. Like the ROUS ( rodents of unusual size ) etc. Acting??? - Decent but that is as far as you can go with that. However we do get to see 1 1/2 hours of Robin Wright Penn, and that makes it all worth it. ;-), actually this is a fantastic movie, definitely recommended.
