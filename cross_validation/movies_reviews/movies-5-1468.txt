I do love Tarintino's work and after watching this I feel he has excelled himself. The direction in this film is just simply beautiful. This doesn't been much meaningful spoken dialogue as the action, movement and reaction of the characers is enough for you to know what is going on. There is an interesting mix of film and animation which gels wonderfully. The fighting scenes are choreographered to perfection. Well worth seeing and I am definately going to see the second one.
