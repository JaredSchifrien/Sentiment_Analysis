I went to a free advanced screening of this film, and I was still tempted to walk out after the first 10 minutes and demand a refund. A movie ad-libbed by a class of 3rd graders would have been more entertaining, and one would at least have been able to understand where the writers were coming from. The whole plot of this movie revolves around two moronic stoners trying to figure out what happened to them the previous night; they can't remember because they were incredibly high and wasted and stupid. I can only assume the film makers went through this exact process after they woke up and found out they had produced this abomination. Even people (including myself) who enjoy movies that are So Stupid, They're Funny will find themselves nauseated and insulted after even brief exposure to this comedic black hole. I hope that those responsible for inflicting the world with Dude, Where's My Car? are very, very sorry. And poor. And covered with honey and fire ants.
