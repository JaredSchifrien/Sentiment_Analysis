A View From The Top is possibly the biggest waste of a cast in the history of the film industry. Gwenyth Paltrow, Christina Applegate, Rob Lowe, Mike Myers, and Candice Bergen form out possibly the best, yet somehow the worst cast in film history. It just doesn't work. Paltrow and Applegate occasionally have chemistry, but that isn't enough to make up for the fact that the characters are one-dimensional cartoons living in another world. Mike Myers and Rob Lowe give cameo performances, while Candice Bergen shouldn't have anything to do with this.
