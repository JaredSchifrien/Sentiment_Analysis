I really liked this movie. In a time when our idea of war is the video game-type air raid on Iraq broadcast live on CNN, it was amazing to see the face to face, musket to musket battles. Displaying his action prowess and tremendous acting ability, Mel Gibson was great. While there were parts that were cheesy and hokey, the action and raw emotion of the characters made it easy for me to overlook those parts. I also liked that even though there is a happy ending (I'm not giving anything away here...if you don't know that the U.S. won the Revolutionary War, you have no business using a computer), there were moments of true loss which is inevitable in times of war. I highly recommend this film and be sure to check it out in the theaters.
