Wow! What an entertaining movie. I simply don't understand the people who don't like this movie, but I'll bet to a person they voted for Clinton. It is a roughly accurate historical portrayal of oppressive English colonialism, and the heroic efforts that were undertaken by the oppressed (Scots). The violence was graphic, but certainly in line with the reality of that time. Gibson did a great job on both sides of the camera. Good mix of comedy (Irish character, Stephen) and romance. I can understand those who say that this movie isn't their cup of tea, but anyone who calls it a bad movie has other motives.
