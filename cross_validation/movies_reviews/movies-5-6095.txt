Actually, this was better than the first one, with elements of humor thrown in with the scares. The director and stars manage to convincingly portray the monster as something to be pitied, and that's not easy to do. It's really sad in a way to watch the final scene where his bride rejects him, because all he really wanted was to be loved.
