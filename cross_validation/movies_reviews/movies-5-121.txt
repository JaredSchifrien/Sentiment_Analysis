Wow. I was blown away by this film. It's one of the greatest crime/thriller films ever made: the performances from Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter and Foster as Clarice Starling make it more the more haunting experience. Hopkins Lecter with his wide eyes and soft voice is chilling and frightening, the way it's directed, the absolutely BRILLIANT Oscar-winning script from Ted Tally, I bought this movie on VHS because it was so good. I highly recommend it, to everybody (over 16). Even if they get scared easy. Summary: A WELL-CRAFTED, FRIGHTENING, BUT GREAT EXPERIENCE. A BRILLIANT FILM.
