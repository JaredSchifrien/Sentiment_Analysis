The only thing scary about this movie is the fact that it EXISTS. It seems that you either love or hate Q. Tarantino's work, and I guess I fall in the latter camp. The gratuitous violence and T A don't really do much, and it seems like the script originated from a role-playing game gone terribly awry. The movie doesn't just switch gears halfway through, it mutates into a really really bad vampire movie (not that I've seen many good ones, but man, this one is probably one of the worst). If you like Tarantino's stuff, this might be alright. Otherwise, I'd suggest a new movie.
