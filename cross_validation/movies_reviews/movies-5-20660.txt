Grease is such a fun musical! I don't know a person who can watch a bit of it and not be singing or humming the tunes along with Sandy and Zuko and the rest of the Pink Ladies and T Birds. It didn't set out to be a deeply moving emotional experience..It is what is was meant to be..fun, goofy High School story full of the dramas of teenage love, along with some great dancing and sappy songs.
