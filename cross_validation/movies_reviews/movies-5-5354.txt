One of America's classic film offerings. This film is delightful. You need to watch this film because: 1) It is a classic. 2) Hollywood, et.al. do not make films like this anymore. 3) One of the greatest actors, Gregory Peck, stars in this film. 4) Who could forget a kid named Scout? 5) Learn a little about the racist South and how contact with Blacks created controversy.
