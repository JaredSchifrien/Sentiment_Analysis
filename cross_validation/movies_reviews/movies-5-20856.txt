One of the best rockumentaries ever done. Great music throughout (excepting fat old Hawkins, but I guess he had to be in there, and that pukey and untalented N. Diamond), well edited and paced. The on-screen interviews of Robertson, Helm, Danko, Manuel and Hudson were pretty unenlightening (not the most talkative or extroverted crew, and perhaps they were laced with something powerful at the time), but this film is a time capsule of the mid-1970s, in terms of the fashions and style of that era. This was sorta the Twilight of the Counterculture, the truly last great gathering of the rockers of the 1960s captured on film. Less than a year after this film was released, the Punk/New Wave era was ushered in and a new pop culture dominant was on top. It's sad to watch this film today and realize that Danko and Manuel are dead and Helm has been silenced by throat cancer.
