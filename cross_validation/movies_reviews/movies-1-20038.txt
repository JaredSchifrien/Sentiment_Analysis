Everyone thinks this movie was based on a true story. Trouble is, It wasn't. There was no real blair witch legend in Burkittsville, Maryland. There was no local witch named Elly Kedward either. She was actually just a young Irish immigrant who wasn't even from that area! Eileen Treacle did not drown in Tappy East Creek. Her mother murdered her in 1864. Tappy East Creek does not exist. There is no Black Hills Forest in Maryland. There's no 'Coffin Rock' either. Sadly, Blair Witch is fake as they come.
