 Far From Heaven uses superb craftmanship to make this film look and feel like a film from the 1950s. It plays like a powerful 1957 drama we've somehow never seen before. One detail is particularly true to the time: interracial love and homosexual love are treated as being on different moral planes. Contemporary movies take so many subjects for granted that they never really look at them. Director Todd Haynes, by stepping back in time is able to bring these issues into focus. Cinematographer, Ed Lachman faithfully reproduces the lush 1950s studio style and every shot has the studied artiface of 1950s set decoration . The musical score, by Elmer Bernstein, is true to the time, with its underlining points and its punching-up emotions.I don't wish to give a synopsis of the movie's scenes except to say it is packed with power, incredible acting, and images that hit home. I had to find it showing in an art theatre as it never made major marquees. Catch if you can!!
