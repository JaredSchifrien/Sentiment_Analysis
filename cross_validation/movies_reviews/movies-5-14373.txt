This film could quit possibly one of the most brilliant motion pictures ever made. No movie has ever made me feel the way this one did. I read the book over a year ago and this is one of the best book adaptions ever. Director Aronofsky is the next Stanley Kubrik. I cannot get over the performances ,the visuals,the score out of my head since I saw it. This film will stick with me forever. Beautiful,dark,scary,depressing and brilliant.Can you smell the Oscars? Mmmmmm...Oh and buy the way if you are seeing this movie just because you might have a chance to see T and A DO NOT GO SEE IT. Not only is there none but this movie is not about sex. It is about love, more specifically love gone wrong. NC-17 does not nesacarily mean nudity. Requien is a highly disturbing beauty of a film and if you are the T and A type who goes to a movie just so they can go home later and masturbate over the pair of breasts you saw instead of seeing it for the brilliant film it is Do NOT GO! You can still love someone and make the wrong choices. We love ourselves as much as we love others. And when an addiction becomes so strong it destroys the emotions and the caring you have toward the ones you love that is love gone wrong.Yes it is about addiction and the depths of depravity people go to get their fix. Sex is in no way a key subject in this film.Yes sex is within the film,yes there is a little nudity, yes there is a graphic sex scene but this is just a means for getting the point of the film accros.Sex as a part in this film is just a side note. If such a deep and thought provoking film disapointed you for the lack of sex and nudity you need to step out of the SHALLOW kiddie pool and step into the BIG KIDS POOL.Sometimes there is more to life than sex. Like meaning. Just a thought.
