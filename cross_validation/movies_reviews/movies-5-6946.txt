This movie is, to my knowledge, the first movie to prioritize jokes and gags over the storyline. Unlike Mel Brooks movies, it's easy to miss most of the jokes the first time through- I highly recommend repeat viewing. The backdrop for this film is an airplane that needs to be landed and a former pilot trying to find the confidence to save the day. The movie stays funny all the way through, though. I loved it!
