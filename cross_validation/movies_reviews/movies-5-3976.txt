Looking back it amazes me that there were so many great films released for children when I was at just the perfect age to appreciate them and file them in my best loved stuff memory archive. This was no exception. Regardless of the fact that I wasn t much into musicals even back then (I have always much preferred hearing straight dialog) - I really loved Mary Poppins . It was wonderful on so many other levels for me. First of all, I adored the turn of the century London setting as well as the great old house, the costumes and the wacky adventures Mary took the children on. Running around on the rooftops of London was probably my favorite what a radically magnificent thing to do! I was also fascinated with the way Mary traveled via umbrella. And, of course, I still mist up when I think of the sweet old lady sitting on the steps of St. Paul s feeding the birds. Mary Poppins is definitely a classic children s flick.
