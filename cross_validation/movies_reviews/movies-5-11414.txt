I loved this book as a child and so I was thrilled when I found out they were remaking this film. It didn't disappoint at all. Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt are at their best, hilarious and loving in a toned down sort of way. The child actors were all surprisingly good and distinct so that you felt like you knew all twelve. This is one of the best family films I've seen in a while. Wholesome and heart-warming, it does suffer a few slapstick, messy jokes but that just makes the kids happy. I definitely recommend it for the whole family.
