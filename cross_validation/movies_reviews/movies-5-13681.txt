It may be a movie with a mostly African-American cast, but the women in this story exist in all races and face the same choices. Whoopi Goldberg shows pain and strength. As she grows, so does the viewer. Oprah Winfrey seems strong, but shows defeat very well. The strength and importance of sisterhood is a message women need to learn and remember, but men need to see this too. You'll enjoy the film, but the book by Alice Walker is even better.
