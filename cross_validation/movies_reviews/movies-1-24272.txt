I'm so very disappointed! I mean I was a major Matix Fan. Both of the first two movies were so good what was the chances they would totally bomb on the last one. I'm sorry but the movie was terrible! What director kills the hero and the main character! Maybe a director from foregin films but nobody else is that stupid.
