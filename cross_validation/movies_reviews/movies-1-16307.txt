I really can't see what all the hype is about -- this movie was no different than any Sunday school class or biblical epic from years gone by; it just had more blood and gore. There was violence for violence's sake, and all Gibson did was tell us a story we already know; yet, it's a story that is uncontested. The subtitles were distracting and took a lot away from the performances given by the actors. The saddest part is Gibson's statement (along with his father) that the Holocaust was a mainly fictionalized event -- but unlike the death of Christ, we actually have documented evidence of the Holocaust. It sickens me that Gibson is making so much fortune off a film about a religious figure. Kind of ironic, is it not?
