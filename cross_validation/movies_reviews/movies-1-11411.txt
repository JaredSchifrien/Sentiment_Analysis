I waited for the funny parts that never came. There is another 'Cheaper by the Dozen' movie that is one of the old classics that was based on the life of the Frank Gilbreth family. It cannot be duplicated and is absolutely nothing like the new one. I promise if you want to see one of the best and funniest of the old classics this is a must see. Clifton Webb starred as the father.
