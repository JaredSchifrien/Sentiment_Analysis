No matter how many times you watch it, you will never stop laughing. The all star cast is great and the plot is so unbelievable that you just keep coming back for more. The characters have many weak, pathetic attempts at finding the money. Some scenes in the film will never die, and whenever you need a good laugh I can guarentee that you will always remember this film.
