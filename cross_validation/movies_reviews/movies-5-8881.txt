Back in what I now call my stoner days 'Up in Smoke' was a favorite. I have seen this movie so many times but for some odd reason I have a hard time remembering it. What I remember of it, is that it is a really funny movie about the wonders of pot. Cheech and Chong protray the stereotypical stoner perfectly. It is even better if you are on their level when you watch the movie.
