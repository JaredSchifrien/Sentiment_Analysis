Great lines: Pox upon me for the oaf that I am , Hee-Haw, Hee-Haw Great theme: An opportunity to examine the impact one's life makes on others. Great cast: Quintessential Jimmy Stewart (made me a life-long fan). Demure and tantalizing (naked in the bushes scene) Donna Reed. Great introspection: When young George has the loving maturity to understand Mr. Gower's grief over the loss of his son. Withstanding his verbal and physical barrage to prevent what could have been a fatally errant prescription. And Mr. Gower's belated awareness and subsequent thankfulness to George. Great scenes: The rush on the bank and Mary sacrificing their honeymoon nestegg to save it. Clarnece ordering that long past due drink at Martini's. And on and on and on. Great impact: Bert and Ernie...alive and well in the hearts of our children on Sesame Street... well of course you get it This is easily an all-time top 5 of my favorite movies that never ceases to choke me up and always makes me long a little for yesteryear.
