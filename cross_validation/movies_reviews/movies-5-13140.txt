This must be one of the most painful movies to watch, and yet it's painfully beautiful. Somehow it manages to be inspiring in the midst of this horrific, incomprehensible tragedy. I didn't see it in the theater, and I really hesitated to rent it, because I kept thinking I had to be in just the right mood to handle something so heavy. While that's true, it shouldn't prevent anyone from seeing this film. Spielberg controls the narrative masterfully. If you don't know much about the Holocaust, you should. And this movie is a great introduction.
