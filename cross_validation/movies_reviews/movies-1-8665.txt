From what I've heard and seen of the movie, it is one of those teenaged movies which is based on sex. That movie is a lot of garbage because it is crude, sends a signal to young people that popularity is what to live for and sex is a cheap and dirty thing, plus it tells young people that swaring is cool. I remember there used to be an old song called American Pie and it was a very good song which even glorified God. It is amazing how sin can stuff things up. Sex when used properly, is a very sweet, clean, good thing which signifies spiritual and physical bondage between husband and wife. It is not to be used out of marriage or anything other then husband or wife.
