Correct me if I am wrong, but, in most horror movies, isn't it the general consensus that we want the protagonist(s) to get away from the evil killer? I think that is the only respect in which Valentine differs from stupid horror movie fare. You actually want these horrid actors to die. Even though the deaths were really disapointing. I suppose the idea in itself is meritorus, but it just came out to be a jumbling mixture of over and under acting, at-times confusing plotline, not to mention the pathetic killer. The murderer is suppose to invoke within the viewer a sense of tense watchfulness. Who will be next? How will they die? In Valentine, one just sits there, not really caring who dies and how (except for when it's really funny like when that crazy guy dies by iron). All in all, I (big surprise) have to say that I do not recommend this movie. Well not if you want to be scared, at any rate. If you want to have a laugh at the expense of a crappy film, well then by all means.
