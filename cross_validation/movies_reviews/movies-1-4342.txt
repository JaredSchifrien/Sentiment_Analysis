For some reason I just didn't like this movie. It seems like it has too much adult humor. I mean, does a kid's movie really have to be laced with enough adult humor to require a PG rating? Just because the parents want to be entertained while taking the kids to this? If the parents want entertainment for themselves, hire a baby sitter and go out to see Bridget Jones Diary, but don't fill America's youth with foul humor even if it is 'sugarcoated'. Shrek was a dissapointment to say the least. The one good thing about it was the I'm a Believer remake, but again, that's for our own enjoyment, does a young child really care about Smashmouth or want a 'rock song' as their movie theme song? I would hope that the answer, even in our jaded world is still no.
