Z-Z-Z-Z-Z. When I saw this movie in a theater, the theater was divided into three groups of people. Group #1 was laughing hysterically from the time the static came on to the time the credits at the end ended. Group #2 was sitting there stone-faced and/or sleeping. Group #3 was occasionally giggling. I was in group #2. The music sucked, the acting was horrible, and the only time I laughed was during the religious talk they had. And throughout the whole freakin' movie, George Clooney looked like he was about to puke from being chained to John Tuturro and Tim Blake Nelson. Their presence might well have been what ruined the movie for me. Please, everyone, for the sake of your sanity and bank accounts, do not buy/rent/think about watching this movie. Take care, everyone!
