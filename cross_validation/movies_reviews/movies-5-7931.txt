One of the best time travel movies isn't a Star Trek one at all! :) Groundhog Day is a hilarious, and at the same time, heartwarming comedy starring the talented Bill Murray and the classy Andie McDowell. Murray's meterological character is trapped in a time loop, reliving Groundhog Day over and over. The results vary wildly, and that's where the fun lies. Crazy comedy of all kind ensues, including one of my favorite scenes, Grand Theft Groundhog.
