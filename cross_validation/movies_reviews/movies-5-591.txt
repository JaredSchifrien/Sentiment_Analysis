I have never seen a thriller so amazing such as the Usual Suspects. It is a brilliant, well directed and well cinematically edited film. Kevin Spacey's performance is excellent and probably even one of his best. This film also contain some unforgivable phrases that are truely amazing. But the thing that is really extraordinary in this film is its astonishing ending, which is almost certainly the best ending ever. This is clearly a must-see film; even more than twice...
