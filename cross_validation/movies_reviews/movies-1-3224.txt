I have to give this movie a terrible rating because it re-enforces sterotypes and the storyline makes no sense unless the point is that white men are more valuable than anyone else. All the South American Rebels are portrayed as trigger happy druggies, which justifies slitting their throats and setting up a battle for the gurrila group to get slaughtered by the army sponsered by corporate intrests, all so that the main charactor's husband can be rescued.
