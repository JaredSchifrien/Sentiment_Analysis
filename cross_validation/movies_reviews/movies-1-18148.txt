The worst movie ever. It is directed by some loser Pollak director, Roman Polaksky or something. No Clive Barker, and no sign of those brilliant actors, Freddy Kruger III, Sir Jason Voorhes or J.Honeyman-Pinhead from Hellraiser. I cried when the movie ended and no one was disemboweled or tortured to death. Is this what I clean toilets all day for? To be ripped off by fancy-pants foreign Polak directors??? Where is my valium?!?!?
