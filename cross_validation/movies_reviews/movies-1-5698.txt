One of the greatest and one of the worst of the 'chick' flicks. Why women romanticize these 'period' pieces (pun intended) is beyond me - you had NO RIGHTS! If you saw a legit representation of the time period, it wouldn't be pretty and it wouldn't look like this phony Hollywood schlock. If you honestly find plantations, slaves, cotton, and the Civil War to be a fantastic backdrop to romance, then you need to ratchet your sense of drama down a couple notches. Not to say the leads weren't great actors (they are to make this turkey such a favorite), just that that Selznick brand of moviemaking left me wondering what the big deal was.
