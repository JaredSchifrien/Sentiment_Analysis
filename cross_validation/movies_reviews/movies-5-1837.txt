Bruce Lee's last movie is nice and more intense. My favorite part is when he killed O'Hara for the self-sacrificing of his sister. Then, the part when he fought in a one on one and also in the room of mirrors, where he finally found a way to kill him with a single fierce kick. My favorite part is when he is showing how quick he is with nunchuks. This movie is cool.
