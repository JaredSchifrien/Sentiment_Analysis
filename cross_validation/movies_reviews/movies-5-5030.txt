Okay, the only way not to like this movie was if you don't speak english. If shark tale's directors' aim was to create a hilarious movie (which i think was the one and only aim with this movie, aside from teaching kids some valuable lessons, which is kinda obvious and u gotta be real dumb to try and hold it against it, cuz its a f***ing kids movie, what do u suppose should be in it, a bloodbath?? hint hint nudge nudge, Seraph) it definitely succeeded. but what i thought was the best about this movie, is the cast, i mean, robert deniro was a brilliant addition, so was angelina jolie. will smith was just being himself, and it turned out just fine. i laughed my ass off on this one, it was definitely worth my time, and what for the ending, it was so apparently created on purpose, with singing and everything, again, for the children. its a children's movie, for crying out loud. how can ppl hold it against the movie? okay, here's an alternative ending: lenny suddenly quits being a vegetarian and eats everyone in the movie. im sure ur kids would love that. or if oscar keeps living a lie and never gets busted, im sure ur kids would learn alot. or lino turns gay and sodomizes everyone, including lenny, im sure that would have been real original, but i doubt it would be politically correct. okay, long story short, i thought the movie was really funny and while it could have been done differently, im satisfied with the way it turned out. so thats a big yes to watching it.
