I recently bought the 3-DVD box set of this trilogy. I am *awed* and impossibly impressed to realize these movies seem to NOT HAVE AGED AT ALL. I was completely blown; because I expected it to be dated. This is especially true in two aspects: the present doesn't seem that unseemingly far away (even though it *was* 20 years ago), and most importantly the future (in BttF 2) is still futuristic--in the way that Robert Zemeckis invented a future that still seems plausible even now. I am unwaiveringly classifying these CLASSIC, MUST WATCH movies for any sci-fi fan. They can be watched and rewatched, thanks to the script of course, but to Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, who have there given the performance of a lifetime. A last, quick note; something the modern viewer will undeniably not with hindsight, is that all three movies are surprisingly continuous. It's obvious that great attention has been given to insure that these movies form a remarkably coherent trilogy. (IMHO, George Lucas sure could use the advice for Starwars)
