'Chinatown' is my personal favorite of all-time. To this day, the performances of John Huston as Noah Cross and Jack Nicholson as Detective Jake Gittes are as memorable as any ever conceived on film. However, the tragic quality of Faye Dunaway's Evelyn Mulwray is what makes this movie such a monument in filmmaking. The movie is further enduring because of how it mocks the audience's childish hopes for a happy ending. Maybe not the greatest film, but definitely the greatest film noir ever. Period.
