One of the best black comedies of the progressive director generation of the late 60's early 70's. Satirical and sometimes ironic, H M is a great example of a movie made from the 60's generation perspective without being overtly hippie. A young upper class man, Harold, living with his cold and preoccupied mother has developed an obsession with death. To elicit an emotional response from his mother (once seen years earlier when she believed him killed) he sets up mock suicide attempts of varying complexities. By the time we see his current attempts his mother has become apathetic and even a bit annoyed with his behavior. He spends his free time attending anonymous funerals at which he first meets Maude. Over the course of the movie we see how a 79 year old free spirit changes the world of this sheltered boy/man.
