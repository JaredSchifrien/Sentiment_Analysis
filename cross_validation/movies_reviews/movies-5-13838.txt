One of my favorite movies. Based on the book by Fannie Flagg, this heart-warming story tells a tale of a forbidden love, murder, compassion, caring and redempion in the South during the early part of the 20th century. Told in narrative by an elderly nursing home resident (played brillianty by Jessica Tandy (but, then again, have you ever seen her act anything but brilliantly?)), the story not only gives you hope, but you can actually see it caried out on the screen by Kathy Bates (also in a brilliant role!) as she listens and befriends the elderly lady. This movie is best watched while actually eating some of the title's namesak FRIED GREEEN TOMATOES. And remember, THE SECRET IS IN THE SAUCE!!!
