As far as I'm concerned, when the '60's/70's ended, so did the appeal of this flakey film and play. Actually having a desire to sit through it now would be like suddenly getting an urge to wear bell bottoms, tie-dyed T shirt, wrap a rag around my head and go around giving the peace sign. It just isn't going to happen.
