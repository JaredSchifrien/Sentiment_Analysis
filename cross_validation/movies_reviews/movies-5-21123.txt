The original 1970's version is trully one of the worst movies ever made, ranking down there with Peter Frampton in SGT PEPPER'S. THe reason I gave this four stars is for the 2000 remake, which I believe was released direct to video ond DVD. That is the version that deserves *****!! It is tremendous. Check it out if you have never seen it.
