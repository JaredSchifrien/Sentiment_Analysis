If bad movies were a crime, Ridley Scott would get LIFE imprisonment! I'm mad as hell that this movie has made so much money in its first week! and I wish there was a way that we could all get our money back!! sir Anthony Hopkins was an idiot for accepting the role.... He has lost the respect as a esteemed actor as far as Im concerned! Jodie Foster probably turned it down because she read the script and saw that it SUCKED!!
