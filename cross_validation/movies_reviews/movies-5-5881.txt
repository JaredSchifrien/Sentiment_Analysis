My favourite movie of all time! And I have been watching movies for 58 years. I can also relate to the film and its location as I worked in Saudi Arabia for 20 years. And travelled extensively in Arabia on and off the job.Including a visit to Acabah I personally drove along the track from Jordan to Medina on the Hejaz railway and seen the trains which Lawrence derailed.Which are still lying there to this day. I have lots of photos and video as proof.I also found in the sand lots of brass cartridge cases from his battle areas.I retired to Dorset when I left Saudi and by coincidence lived just a few miles from where Lawrence came off his motor bike and from where he is buried.Anyone who can organise Arabs the way Lawrence did.Has to be a very special person.I know, I worked in the training department of a large Arabian Oil Company!
