 This movie is an insult to men everywhere. This movie makes it seem like the only thing keeping a man from being a rapist is getting caught. This movie is about a man who goes insane after being invisible for three days in a basement. So insane he decides to start killing his friends and co-workers. Wow! great idea for a movie! Great excuse to show some boobs! Makes me want to cry...
