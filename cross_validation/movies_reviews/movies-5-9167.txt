This is a film that I had to watch more than once to take it in. Unique storyline and superb acting. John Malkovitch is fantastic as is John Cusack and Cameron Diaz. They work together extremely well and made it work. This will be a cult film and will most probably be studied by film students. I'm glad I own this film.
