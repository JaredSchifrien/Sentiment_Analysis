Another superb Pokemon motion picture, this one has it all. Great action, slick animation, good humor and even cool music. The plot involves a little girl unleashing the psychic energy of the mysterious Pokemon, Unown. She imagines the legendary Pokemon, Entei as her father. Meanwhile, our heroes are proceeding through the town where all this is happening...Team Rocket has some great lines where they break the fourth wall with style, and of course, you have Brock hitting on girls. Finally, the animation is smoother than the early episodes, especially during the battle sequences.
