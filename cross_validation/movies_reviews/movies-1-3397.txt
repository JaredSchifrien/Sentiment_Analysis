I really wanted to give an extra * for the bombing and battle scenes,but i just can't.that american flag sinking is not a metaphore for me it is just a terrible clichee.and ok,if you are a woman,the lead actors may be quite appealing,but hey,you can always use the tabloids for that.it is amazing what great actors can do for a buck (or a lot of bucks).I mean, Alec Baldwin should be ashamed for accepting such a trash.As for the dialogue:God help the German Army if there are more like you where you came from-says the British squadroom leader to Affleck's character.Jesus,what was the screenwriter thinking?!It is that kind of lame dialogue that can ruin everything in a movie.As for the story...At one time, I just wanted to scream:why dont you two just share the bimbo and get it over with!Love triangle my foot!Too bad for the actors,but I have to say that I always find something annoying about Ben Affleck, no matter what he does.
