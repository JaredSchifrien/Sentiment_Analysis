I read the name and was in love (ha ha). Charecters were developed in a very unique way, with the narration helping this development. I almost took the part where the dog is told not to Snatch personally, because I saw myself jumpin on the band wagon, and snatching it up. I took this movie very seriously. I wanted to watch it again and again. I want to be like any of the charecters, that is why I liked this movie. The charecters are unique. I associated with Bullet Tooth Tony the most, he was a bad ass and he got the job done, or so we wre made to think from the story about him taking 6 bullets. He had his way of doing things and it worked. Like Avi did, I would also hire this man. The black men added some comedy to the story. Brit Top (the nemisis) is the perfect villen. I enjoyed seent him get taken out. Brad Pitt and the Pikers, need I say more! I now need to take a trip to England. Anybody know how to get to Antwerp?
