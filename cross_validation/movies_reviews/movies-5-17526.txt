Fantastic movie! It's the story of a boy who is Jewish in Germany before and during the war who passes himself off as a pure German. Wonderfully done, one of the best foreign language films I've ever seen. It's so good that you forget that you're reading it and just get wrapped up in the drama. See it!!
