A very intense, chilling movie that exploits the racial issues that still exist far and throughout this great country of ours. As usual, Edward Norton, the charismatic actor that he is, gives us a brilliant performance as a brutal skinhead who when released from prison has finally seen the error of his ways. Talk about a brilliant character transformation. I thought that Norton and his working buddy in the prison did a wonderful job together. Also a great performance by the usually-annoying Edward Furlong. It truly is a shockingly blunt film with its language and exploitation of the brutal reality of racism. Racism offends me, but I still found this to be a very good movie, and I suggest that all Americans, whether you've been able to let go of racism or not, see this film.
