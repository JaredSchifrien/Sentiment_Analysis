Carp all you want about the man and his movies--but Moore DID try to warn America. Yet more than half voted for the sh*thead Bush even after this not-seen-broadly-enough movie. And now you see how true the film portriat was--a pompous, stupid, clueless, uncaring man is dragging us down, and we "get" three more miserable years of it... Thanks for trying, Michael...
