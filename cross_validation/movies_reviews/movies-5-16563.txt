I really liked this movie because it depicted the life of a woman who you can be angry with, but also pity. Beverly (Drew Barrymore) isn't too intelligent. She's dumb and naive and falls in love too easily. But then she gets pregnant and is forced to marry a Junkie and the crazy adventures of her life begin! Beverly starts off as a ignorant, heavily lacking in the brains department type of girl, then comes out as a woman who made her own success.
