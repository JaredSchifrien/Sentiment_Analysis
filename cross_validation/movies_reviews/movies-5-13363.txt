It's a wonderful, fairy tale story. Just a pleasent way to spend a few hours. Tom Hanks is a wonderful actor, and this is great showcase for his talent. Ithe words of the advertising department of TV LAND, this movie has REWATCHABLITY. There is always something enjoyable to see, weather it's the first or fiftieth time you have seen it.
