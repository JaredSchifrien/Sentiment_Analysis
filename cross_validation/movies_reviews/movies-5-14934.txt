I thought that the patriot was one of the best movies ive ever seen. it had all the essentials to being a great movie, too. ive tried to find it out on vhs but i can never find it. i can only find it out on dvd. well ive rented it and watched it so many times that i know every word that mel gibson is going to say. i really like the fighting scenes, also.
