This movie was a lame attempt at trying to be shocking through sex and nudity. I've had kinkier parties than that, and that's no lie. This story didn't excite me, or entertain me. It was dull. People should have orgies from time to time. It's good for the ego. I would have to say that the story could have gone in so many other directions to make the tale an interesting one, and it doesn't. More movies need to be made to tease the sexual psyche of people and this one didn't make it. I like Kubrick, just not this last movie of his.
