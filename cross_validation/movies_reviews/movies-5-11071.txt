Ok I really loved this movie saw it twice in the movie theatre...I really recommend this to EVERYONE! You know I really dont like the people that really take the jokes personally...hello their called jokes for a reason. And I really loved that they embraced everything with the gay community because I have a gay relative and I really thought that was so beautiful...go see this movie it has a wonderful message to send...
