This movie truly does what a thriller movie should and ought to do and hasn't been doing since the days of Alfred Hitchcock. It wasn't until we finished viewing the film that certain questions started to creep on our psyche and our consciences. Is there truly life after death? Are we alive and living or walking entities? Hayley Joel Osment was outstanding as Cole Sear who kept a dark secret from his unsuspecting mother - having the ability to see ghosts. Bruce Willis surprised me as he was actually quite good. This film has to be the best out of all of M Night Shymalan's films to date.
