I give this film five stars, not basing it on the entire world horror films, but the horror films of today. It's hard for a horror fan to find a good flick nowaday. The concept of survival is portrayed very well, and the originality of the zombies' behavior, as compared to George Romero's, was incredible. Finally, a new take on old material.
