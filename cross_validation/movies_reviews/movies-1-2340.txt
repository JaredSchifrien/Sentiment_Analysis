You know what? Hollywood won't stop making these movies until we stop watching them. You will continue to see terrible special effects and even worse acting until we stop wasting our money. The Mummy is one of the many perfect examples of worthlessness that are being tossed in our direction. For the love of God don't watch this movie.
