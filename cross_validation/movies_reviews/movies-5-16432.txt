I thought it was a fantastic film! I respect all the other opinions but I definitley do not agree with them whatsoever! The symbolism was incredibly indepth.. from the elm trees, to the sun being symbolic of hope. Of course Lux was concentrated on the most because she was a vital catalyst for the other girls freedom.. she was symbolic of freedom.. she was the only one who dared to step outisde of the square.. what i suggest to all of you who didn't understand it, is watch it again and note down the re-occurring images, and try to note the symbolism (they're usually portrayed quite obviously, through either static images, or just out of place images) and then begin to understand the flow to the story, because I guarantee, once you fully understand the film, you'll think it's fantastic!
