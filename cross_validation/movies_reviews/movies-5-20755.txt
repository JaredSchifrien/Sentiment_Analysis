Hoppatootie bless my soul, I really love this real strange show! One of the most wickedly hilarious movies I have ever or will ever see. You can't explain its weird appeal to someone who doesn't see the humor and you don't have to explain it to anyone else. The now classic songs alone are worth the price of a CD and in a very odd way are addictively memorable not to mention great fun to sing. I would venture to say there has never been another character on stage or screen quite like his insane strangeness the bizarre Dr. Frankenfurter. Though there have been many imitations over the years, none have managed to do a more exquisitely decadent and drop dead funny interpretation than Tim Curry. The man is a true offbeat acting genius. His character also has one of the best entrances I've ever seen in a film. One thing about the Rocky experience I should mention - the first time you see it you need to go through some kind of indoctrination to get into the proper crazy frame of mind to appreciate it. If you don't, you may soon be sitting there with multiple question marks over your head - especially if you just rent it on video. My indoctrination occurred over time by working around a guy - insanely funny in his own right - who, in a former life as an art student, had been one of the regular actors in local Saturday night screenings. Of course, he knew all the wacky lines and lyrics and probably could have done a one man show himself. It was mostly due to his hilarious office performances that I ended up renting the movie and then buying the CD. Sadly, we don't work together any more and the Rocky routines are history as well. But every now and then - when the moon is full - those great memories will cross my mind and, as I sit there rather maniacally chuckling to myself, I have such an overwhelming urge to get up wherever I am and do THE TIME WARP AGAIN!
