 Put the God Damn dog in the bucket! That creepy cross dressing naked pee pee hiding man still enters my nightmares once in a while. I think this is the most frightening psychological thriller I have ever seen. Strangely, I started to like Hannibal and the demented relationship that he was creating with Agent Starling. I may be sick. But this is a classic that you can watch over again and still be freaked out.
