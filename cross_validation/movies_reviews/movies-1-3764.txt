UUUUUUUGGGGHHHHHH! This movie was the most irresponsible, unwatchable, sorry excuse of a movie that was ever, I mean EVER, created. There was very little resemblence of a real NASCAR race or race team in this movie. It is the worst movie ever about NASCAR. Tom Cruise was wooden. The rest of the cast could barely hold their own. The script was unbelievable for any NASCAR fan. The action sequences were filmed during an actual running of the Daytona 500. That is the entire highlight. Everything else is drivel.
