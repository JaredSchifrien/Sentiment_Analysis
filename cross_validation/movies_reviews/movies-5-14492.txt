This movie was AWESOME! The movie was very well-directed, the actors did a great job, even though I expected a little less from some of the new-comers, and the writing was great. Patrick Fugit did a great job portraying a naive and caring boy who learns a life lesson, not to mention that he has a lot of talent and will be a big star. This movie gets two of my thumbs up!
