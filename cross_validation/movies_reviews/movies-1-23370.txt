It won an Oscar. It had the funny Jim Carrey and the beautiful Kate Winslet. But I frankly found it one of the most boring, stultifying, and wearisome movies I have seen in a long time. Right up there with the death-inducing Dogville in terms of boredom. We watched it one night, wifey passed out in 10 minutes and I made it to 15. She blamed me that looking at my droopy eyes made her fall asleep. We tried again a couple of nights later. She konked out in 8 minutes this time while I pretty much drifted off to sleep about the same juncture as the previous night. She had the chutzpah to say the next morning, I still want to see it. Now how good of a movie could it be if it puts 2 fairly intelligent adults asleep twice? My theory is that I just can't stand Charlie Kauffman movies, as I Found Being John Malkovich almost as boring and stupid. Kauffman looked like such a dork at the Oscars during his acceptance speech. 30 seconds, 29 seconds, I find this very unsettling, 26 seconds, I can't think of any thing to say, this is so distracting, 24 seconds...
