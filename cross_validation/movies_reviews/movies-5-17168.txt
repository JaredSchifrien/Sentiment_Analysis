People have completely disregarded the very essence of what this movie is actually trying to capture. Its looking at the SATIRICAL, indirect, negative, double-standard downfall of the industry to ethnic minorities or even minorities as a whole. People are quick to pidgeon-hole or point the finger at minorities for many negative outcomes, yet still their celebrated in sports and the media and big wig companies jump immediately to promote their products (nike, adidas, reebok, coca cola, business cards etc) to me thats just double-standards. If we look at programmes like Eastenders for instance thats not the East London I know of. East London is booming with Asians, Gays, Blacks you name it. Yet still why are these parts so badly represented, stereotyped or even portrayed or even worse not represented at all?? The black face in this movie was extremely offensive, but thats exactly what Spike Lee wanted the viewer to think about when these guys performed for a TV show. I like it that directors such as Spike Lee, Oliver Stone, Michael Moore and Mel Gibson take risks and give their audiences something to think about. If not the film industry would be a terribly boring place indeed.
