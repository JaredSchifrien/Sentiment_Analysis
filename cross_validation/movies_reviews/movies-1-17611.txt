Like the book it was based on, Left Behind: The Movie just shows how arrogant some Christians can be about their faith. For thousands of years, people have been saying that the world is going to end soon, but the world is still here. The same is true today. The world is not going to come to an end any time soon, despite what this pretentious film tries to convince its audience. Anyone who says this movie contains the truth is a liar. They could not possibly know that this movie is true, and it is dishonest to claim otherwise.
