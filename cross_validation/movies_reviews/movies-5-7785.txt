I do not like golf or hockey, and I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler. Nevertheless, I still thoroughly enjoyed this movie. There were few sexual references, although the language was a bit harsh. I think that it says a lot about the main character (Happy Gilmore), that he did something that he did not want to do to help his family. It was a comedy with character, and compoletely deserving of my five stars!
