Don't go to this film expecting anything deep. Take it for what it is and enjoy the ride. Don't get overly critical about some of the technical stuff (like some friends of mine!); that would be like complaining about the script quality of a Saturday morning cartoon. The action really gets the blood going and the humor keeps the movie fresh and fun. It's a great show to catch if your looking to go out and have a good time with friends, and those with kids probably don't have to worry about the PG-13 rating (some of the violence might be too much for those with really young ones). All in all, it's great entertainment that I'd easily recommend to my friends.
