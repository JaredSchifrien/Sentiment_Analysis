This is a great movie. Here something to do with OZ. On the third lions roar on the MGM Logo, start the album Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd. If you timed it right, When Miss Gulch is riding her bike to the Gale Farm, a bunch of clocks should be chiming, the song Money should start when it goes to color. Just listen to the words in the song while watching the movie and I think you will enjoy it.
