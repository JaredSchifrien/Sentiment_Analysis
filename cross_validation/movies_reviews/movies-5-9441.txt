I was surprised to see that Tootsie was so far down the list.Dustin Hoffman was great as an out of work actor who dresses up as a woman to audition for a part.{this was after his agent told him that no one would hire him.} He ends up getting a role on a daytime soap . being an actor who was known to be difficult, he was not much different being a woman. When he did not like the script for the show he would adlib and say it the way he thought his/her character would say it. Well the audience loved this take no guff character.and the temporary role got extended. Meanwhile he grows to really like an actress, on the show. He still has to parade as a woman so the results from all of this can be real funny, from the misunderstandings.He now back himself into a corner he must get out of. We found this movie enjoyable with a lot of laughs.
