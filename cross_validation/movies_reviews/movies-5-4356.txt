Our family saw Shrek today. We all really liked it. It was a fairy tale that all ages could enjoy. An Ogre and a donkey have to save a princess and bring her back to this want to be king. In this movie there are a lot of the fairy tale characters we have heard about for year. I t is a very clever movie and can be very funny. It has music that even the adults can enjoy. Some of the humor is for older kids and adults but the little kids will not get.Eddie Murphy is funny as the donkey.We considered it a rare treat the whole family can enjoy.
