Great movie full of beautiful cars (minus the Civic's which are crap). Anyone who says otherwise doesn't know all that much about cars. (BTW, V8's are much heavier than V4's, so even because they DO have more power, they weigh down the car, which is why a V6 is the best to have, but V4 is definately a better choice than a V8 because of the power one can get from a couple of NOS tanks) I love racing and this movie is a great representation of it. (And another comment, races are very rarely only a quarter mile. If that were the case they would only last 10-15 seconds. If people who claim the first race in the movie was supposed to be a quarter mile, then they obviously don't know what a 10 second car is- a car that can do the 1st 1/4 mile in 10 seconds or less.)
