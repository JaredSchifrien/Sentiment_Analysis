I love South Park and I love this movie yet I am a conservative. And I'm not a race-hating warmonger. I believe that in the movie it was Clinton who declared war and Kyle's ultraliberal Barbara Streisand-loving mother who spearheaded the whole thing. The main underlying theme of this movie is about how parents who don't wanna take responsibility for their own kids need to stop bitchin at all the environmental factors and take some time to talk to their kids about right and wrong in calm and sensical terms... instead of teaching them hateful intolerance toward people they disagree with. Matt and Trey have made it clear with South Park over the years that they are not anti-conservatives. In fact when you watch the show you can pick up many of their often conservative values about issues like abortion, parenting ethics, and not the least the persistance of ultraliberals who seek to force their beliefs and values on all moderates and others. They unlike some of their fans are not intolerant and hateful of conservatives.
