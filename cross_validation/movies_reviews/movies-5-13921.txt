All I have to say is two names: Tom Cruise and Aaron Sorkin. Aaron Sorkin is the best director and writer I have seen in a long time. He finally got recognized in 2000 at the Emmy's for his talent. A Few Good Men has great looking guys and a believable plot as to what might happen to a weak member of a military squadron.
