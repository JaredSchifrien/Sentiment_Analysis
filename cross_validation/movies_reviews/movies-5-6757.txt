Still the best giant monster movie even with the dubbing and cut footage from the original 1954 japanese version. Raymond Burr is quite good in this American version, it was the first movie to scare me as a kid and at the same time enthrall. I can still watch it over and over even today at 31 years old and get the same feelings it gave me back when I saw it at 8.
