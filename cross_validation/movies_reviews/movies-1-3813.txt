There were a couple of moments where I thought the film could rebound and turn out to be halfway decent, but I was certainly wrong. I really don't see how it classifies as an action flick to begin with. It would be better suited under drama (rated at the bottom of the list of course). The plot was hard to follow, and it's quite questionable as to whether there actually was one. A sappy love story with NO plot is never a good thing, and certainly never makes for a good action flick.
