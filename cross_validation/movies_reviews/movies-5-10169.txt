I don't care how lame, or stupid some people think this movie is, it still has a great story line and it is definately a feel good coming of age movie. It wasn't filled with garbage or too much sex. A perfect teen movie that if I had teenagers of my own, I would definately recommend this movie to them. Alicia Silverstone is a talented actress who will go far if she keeps her talent pointed in the right direction.
