MUNICH is a triumph. (JAWS : fish bites boat.......... ET : a fuggly alien can be cuddly....... SAVING PRIVATE RYAN : WWII was about dumb-dumb Matt Damon ? ) This movie is Speilberg's redemption song. Eric Bana is a knight on a quest to vanquish evil, but as we know, like the poor, our lord said evil will always be with us...our best friend our intimate enemy. The violence and the shock value puts other hacks to shame........ ( Scott / Scorcese / Attenborough / Coppolla / Peckinpah / Tarantino etc ) These lessons of Munich will be learned & re-learned, off screen & off -----God help us.
