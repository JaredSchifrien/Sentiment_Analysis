 Resevoir Dogs is Tarantino's preliminary film to the chronologically disjointed and colorfully violent film, Pulp Fiction . It had the same elements of Pulp.. without being as polished or grand. It's a smaller story with a rawer edge, but that doesn't detract from the fact that it is an exhilarating film full of sharp dialogue and intriguing situations. The particular thing that struck me about Resevoir Dogs was the special camraderie among the characters. It gave us a glimpse into the personifications of the oxymoron-'honorable criminals'. Keitel's 'Mr. White' is the foremost example of this: the second scene in the film where Mr. Orange was bleeding profusely from the gut and White was holding his hand and encouraging him to hang on was one of the most interesting and heartwrenching scenes of cinematic male-bonding without being too melodramatic or kitsch-y.
