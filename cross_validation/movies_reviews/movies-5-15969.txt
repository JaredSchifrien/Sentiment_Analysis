This was thought-provoking, indeed. If Van Helsing is what you're getting excited about, you probably won't like this film, I would think. Anyway, I see how there is an American critique in the film's themes, but I saw more of an allegory of the Christian faith. This is where the power comes from. Otherwise, I don't understand the ending if it's only about being anti-American. Brilliant I thought.
