Aside from the ever-gleeful sight of seeing Adam Sandler decked by a man who knows family-friendly entertainment (Go, Bob Barker, legendary host of Price is Right!) or decked by anyone for that matter, this is yet another R-rated golf comedy that does know wrong and does no right. Avoid at all costs, except the scene where the stupid Sandler decked, of course.
