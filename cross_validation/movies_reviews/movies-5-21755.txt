The final chapter of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movie trilogy is the best, taking, as it does, all the storylines that were sere set up and developed in the first two and tying them up in Tolkien-esque fashion. Some viewers may not care for the last twenty/thirty minutes, as Jackson plays out the post-war endings for each of the major characters, but his decision is fitting: we've spent too much time with these characters to end with a simple, It's over! With the exception of the gentleman who played Denethor, the acting is the best it's been in the series. As each of the major players has been given more to do, they have stepped up and met the challenge. This is the finest motion picture of 2003.
