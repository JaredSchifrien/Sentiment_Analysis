(Warning: Contains spoilers) Very fun movie. This takes place about 2 years after the first movie left off: Peter's in college, and is having a rough time balancing his normal life with his web-slinging job, and he realizes his need to set his priorties straight. Personally I think it might have been a bit too soon for Spider-Man to unmask himself to some people, but I guess it needed to be done. Either way, it was worth watching.
