What a joke!!! You guys should really get your facts straight and don't trust a puppet that's funded by Hollywood. His documentary is riddled with more holes than a slab of swiss cheese. First of all he used an excerpt from a Bush speech and claimed it was regarding the Iraq war. In reality he was talking about the Israelis and the Palistinians. He claims that Bush invited the Taliban to Texas for a visit. Wrong, a Texas oil company that had nothing to do with Bush invited him. What he failed to mention was the fact that Mr. Bill Clinton actually DID invite the Taliban to visit this country! Nice try Michael Moron... Please do yourself a favor and check the facts out before believing any of his propaganda.
