Wow! Beautifiul. Fun for the whole family. Climactic, brilliant, amazing. My favorite childs film. A real beaut. An absolute must-see. I could go on for hours about how absolutely marvellous this film is, but I won't bother. Probably could've done without the stupid fart-jokes, but it's still beautiful, sad, entertaining, see it now. Summary: A BEAUTIFUL, SAD, ENTERTAINING, INSPIRED FILM THAT HAS HARDLY ANY FLAWS.
