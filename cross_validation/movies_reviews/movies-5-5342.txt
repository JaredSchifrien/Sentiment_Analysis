This was an excellent movie. Gregory Peck in one of his finest roles as Atticus Finch. I love the characters of Scout, Jem, and Dill. They were typical kids growing up in the south during the time the movie portrayed. The movie kept you interested, scenes that left you anticipating the next moment. Loved Robert Duvall in the part of Boo Radley. This movie will always be one of the best classic. They don't make them like this anymore.
