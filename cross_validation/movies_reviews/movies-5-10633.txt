A very offbeat comedy that offends just about everybody. Taking place in the 60s or 70s (when it was filmed), it's about an advertising agency with a token black guy on the board of directors. When the head guy dies and they have to select a new CEO, everybody votes for the black guy assuming that nobody else will and therefor they won't be giving a vote likely to offer them competition. He takes over and in his first speech says, "I just want you to know, I'm not here to rock the boat. I'm here to sink the f----er!" The ads they produce thereafter are hilarious!
