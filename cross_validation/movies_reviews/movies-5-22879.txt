This movie was well done in my opinion. Had some great action sequences and other satisfying moments. I enjoyed seeing Pyro retalliate against the police. Magneto's escape from his plastic prison was also a memorable moment. It got a little cheesy towards the end. The ending promises a sequel but the bad thing is that you have to wait a couple more years to find the story's conclusion.
