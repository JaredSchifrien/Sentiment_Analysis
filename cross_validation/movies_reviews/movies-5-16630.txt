A really good family movie. I've seen it 3 times (in one day). The actors did such a wonderful job. Alexis Bledel, a newcomer to acting, was perfect for the role of Winnie. then, the ever joyful Jesse Tuck, played by Jonathan Jackson. And Sissy Spasek, William Hurt, Ben Kingsley, and Scott, it's perfect. I found it followed the book very well. Besides the romance part, that still added a lot to the movie as a whole. The story was very well written to begin with, and very well directed as well. All in all, a wonderful movie, that everyone can all enjoy again and again.
