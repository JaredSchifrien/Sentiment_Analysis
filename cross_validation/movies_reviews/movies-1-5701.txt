Gone with The Wind has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. Words can not describe my disappointment with this movie, especially after hearing so much hype as to how wonderful the movie was and etc. I guess when the movie debut in 1939- it was a great movie for the time. However, by today's standards, this movie is nothing but trash. I could not help but to laughed through most of the movie because the acting was so bad. I kind of feel sorry for the people who remember when Gone with The Wind was considered a great movie- it clearly shows how far the United States of America has come since the dark ages of the oppressive South.
