I know Garfield and this isn't it. It's just a boring, generic, anaemic kids movie. Garfield looks like c***, most of the acting is poor (especially Jennifer Love Hewitt, who acts so forced) and the plot is not true to the comic. For example, Garfield hates Odie. He doesn't become friends with him like he does here. Liz also hates Jon. Any date they went on in the comic strip was a disaster. Here, they like each other. The only acceptable performance is from Bill Murray as Garfield. The villain is generic kiddy c*** I've seen a thousand times over, and is acted out as such. The rescue is both unoriginal and unexciting. The rest of the animals are just normal animals, which looks kind of cheap and they are only related to the comic by name (for example, Arlene doesn't appear to be Garfield's girlfriend). In conclusion, if you're a Garfield fan, don't see this. Garfield: The Movie could have been interesting to watch, but it just isn't. I like the comic. I hate this movie. 1/5 stars - You've been warned
