I loved the Butterfly Effect. It's very suspenseful and it was impossible to tell what would happen next, and it also has a good plot. (it's a very complicated plot and i won't begin telling it to you here) BEWARE the movie is extremely disturbing, among the sadistic moments in this movie are child pornography, a dog being burnt alive, and plenty of fighting using blunt heavy objects. This is a hit or miss movie. You will either love or loathe it.
