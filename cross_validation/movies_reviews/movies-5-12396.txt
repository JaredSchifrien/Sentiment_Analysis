What Philip Seymour Hoffman does in the title role is less acting than it is an act of necromancy. I am always in reverent awe when I witness truly great acting, and that's what you'll see here. Hoffman is nothing less than stupendous as Truman Capote. He brings the character back to life in the same way that Jack Nicholson did with "Hoffa" and George C. Scott did with "Patton." Where the 1967 film "In Cold Blood" focused on the 2 killers, the murders they committed, their trial, and eventual execution, "Capote" focuses instead on the monumentally-talented, monumentally-egotistical and tortured man who immortalized them in his classic "non-fiction novel." The film covers the period from when Capote first read of the Clutter murders in the NY Times in November 1959 until the executions of Perry Smith and Richard Hickock in April 1965 in Kansas. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent. Particularly noteworthy are Clifton Collins Jr. as Perry Smith, Catherine Keener as Harper Lee, and Chris Cooper as Detective Alvin Dewey. It's very rare that I'm so enthusiastic about a contemporary movie, so take my heartfelt advice, and run, don't walk, to see it. You probably won't be able to catch the film at your local multiplex mall theatre (which will probably be playing "Harry Potter" in 2 theatres and the latest Adam Sandler-Tara Reid movie), but if you do revere great acting as I like to think I do, this is one you won't want to miss. Trust me. It'll be worth the effort of searching it out.
