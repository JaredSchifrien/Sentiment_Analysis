This movie was, in my point of view, the BEST in 1999! The special effects set new standards! Yet the story was awesome and most of all, the fighting scenes! The only thing one may dislike about the Matrix is that there wasn't a relationship between Neo and Trinity. I saw this movie 3X in the theaters!
