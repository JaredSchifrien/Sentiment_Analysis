We watched it in social studies class... there was a bit of an issue getting us allowed to watch it because of language or whatever but we ended up seeing it. I liked it a lot. Good movie, good plot. I think it was realistic, but they didn't go overboard on the blood and gore trying to get more viewers, or however they do that...
