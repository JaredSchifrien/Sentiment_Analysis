The minute I sat in that cinema seat, I became a child again... and I loved it! Far from saying the film is for kids, as the many political undertones and cultural references are clearly aimed at an older audience, most probably people like me who grew up with the X-Men and don't mind slipping back into our childhood for two hours and seeing our imaginations portrayed in on the big screen. Die hard comic book fans do have to realize that the screen is a very different medium to the comic, so concessions and sacrifices do have to be made, as painful as they are (Gambit). I thoroughly enjoyed reliving the easy days, so I can't wait for the next one!
