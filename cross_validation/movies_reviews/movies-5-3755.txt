This is Michael Mann at his best. Everyone talks about Silence of The Lambs as the best movie from the Thomas Harris novels, but this one is right there with it. One of my all-time favorite action scenes is at the end of the movie when Peterson's character jumps through a pane of glass to rescue a woman from the killer. It is timed in such a way that his crashing through the glass coincides with the reemergence of the guitar and drums from a long dormant period in Iron Butterfly's Inna-Godda-Da-Vida.
