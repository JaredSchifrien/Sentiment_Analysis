I just finished watching this movie for a second time and love it even more. If you want car chases, gun fights, romance, or comedy then you'll be disappointed. If you want to see a REAL movie and one with substance, then 25th hour is a good one. An awesome look at a man who had it all (great friends, love of his life, loving father, etc.) and threw it all away. Spike Lee gets the audience to feel what the characters feel. Also, 25th hour proves that Spike Lee is more than just movies about race. He made a wonderful movie about HUMAN suffering.
