"The Women" reeks of caricature and female bashing (the author of the stage play on which it is based was Clare Booth Luce) and is very funny and highly enteraining. Come to think of it, men aren't portrayed too well either. The gimmick is there are no men in the cast, just mentioned constanly by all the female characters. Joan Crawford and Paulette Goddard do real well...but Norma Shearer plays such a self sacrificing noble goody two shooes wimp per most of the film that you just want to smack her across the head.. Mary Boland IMO steals the movie as the Countess.
