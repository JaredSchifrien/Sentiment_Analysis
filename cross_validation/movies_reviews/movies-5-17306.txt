I saw this in the cinema and could not leave my seat for a while. All I could do was try to get over my sobbing, and all I could say was, Wow. That was the best movie I've seen in a long time. People say that it took the holocaust and made light of it. I disagree. I think it was a film about love--not rjust romantic love--the greater sense of the word. It was about how love can endure in even the most horrific situations.
