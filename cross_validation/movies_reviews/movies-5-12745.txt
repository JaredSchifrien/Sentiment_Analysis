My husband encouraged me to watch this movie. I think it is a GREAT movie because it opens the public's eyes to so much information that we normally don't get to see unedited. We only get to hear & see what the government wants us to unless we dig a little deeper. Kudos to Michael Moore for making it his mission to dig a little deeper and pass it on to the American public.
