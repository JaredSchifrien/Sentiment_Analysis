If I were speaking to the people who said that this movie was bad, I would do it veeeery slooooowwly so as they would be able to understaaaaand me. The thing about this movie is that you need to look deeper. There are layers, it is complicated--you can't look at it like you would look at the current Julia Roberts movie and just go home. This movie requires contemplation, and it is certainly not indicative of a dark place inside yourself. Please. If you liked this movie, you are able to appreciate individuality and the situations that arise in all walks of life. I feel like if you didn't like this movie, you need, to reuse the movie's tagline, look closer.
