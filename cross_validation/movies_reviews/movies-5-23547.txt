A great installment in the superhero series. I would even say it was better than the first movie. Fun and charming, it had better flow and held the attention better than the first Spider-man movie did. Great special effects and a good storyline, Tobey Maguire has the role of Peter Parker down to an art. I hope he continues to play the masked hero since this film left the doors wide open for a third. Definitely worth seeing.
