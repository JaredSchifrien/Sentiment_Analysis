The best French movie of 2000, it is a pleasure to see such a good movie, with such an excellent cast. Jean-Pierre Bacri is terrific and I would advise you to see the movie in French , if I dare to say, because there's a wonderful scene in which he speaks so well english it could scare you to death about French people... Enjoy that movie, it is typically French!
