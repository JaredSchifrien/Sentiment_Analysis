An instant classic. I was in a fraternity in college so I can relate to the drinking, partying, and taking advantage of girls. In this movie, guys in their early 30's are having sort of a mid-life crisis and starting a fraternity is an escape from reality for them. Old School takes you throw some aspects of starting a fraternity and pledging, and it is hysterical.
