Spy Kids was a great family movie, I would call it a James Bond junior. Most of the movies we end up taking our kids to have little or no parent entertainment value. For a family movie, it had a good mixture of effects, plot, action, suspense, and humor to keep kids and parents involved. The kids did not jump up to go to the bathroom even once, now that says a lot for a movie.
