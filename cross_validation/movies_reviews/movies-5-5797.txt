A magnificent movie that toally whole heartedly rocks. Probably the best court room drama ever. It has superb acting by screen greats; Henry Fonda, Jack Warden, Lee J. Cobb, and Martin Balsam. Though it is set in a jury room, and besides the 12 jurors has only 3 other main faces, it is one fabulous movie. The script is perfect and acting amazingly realistic to a jury room. Total 5 star fair.
