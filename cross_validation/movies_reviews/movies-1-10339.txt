 About Schmidt easily qualifies for my list of the ten worst movies I've ever seen. Its incredibly slow pace, depressing tone, and pathetic attempt to convey something deep made it extremely unpleasant and annoying to watch. The plot goes nowhere, and I couldn't find anything compelling about the characters. I'm surprised to note that this is the first time I haven't been impressed by Jack Nicholson and Kathy Bates. There's simply not a single reason to watch this movie.
