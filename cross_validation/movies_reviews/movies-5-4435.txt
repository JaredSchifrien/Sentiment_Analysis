This movie was superb! We saw it four times. The humor is exceptional. Alot of it is missed by the American audience, probably, but we love Nick Parks and Wallace and Gromit. The characters were fantastic. We enjoyed it every bit as much as our nine year old daughter, Cheyenne. Babs was one of our favorites.
