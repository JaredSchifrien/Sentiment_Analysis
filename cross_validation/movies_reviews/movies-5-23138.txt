i've been watching this movie since i was a kid. i am 22 now and it's still one of my favorites of all time. the soundtrack and costumes of the main characters are really 80's, but everything from the sets and props to the dialogue is so well executed that to me it remains timeless. as well as it's alice-in-wonderland-type theme. where a daydreaming young girl, reluctant to leave her fantasies behind and grow up (a problem i can certainly relate to), learns to accept and appreciate her life and the people in it for the way they are.
