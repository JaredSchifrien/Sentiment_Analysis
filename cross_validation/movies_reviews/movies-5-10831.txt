Kevin Smith is of course my favorite writer director. This was a great was of saying goodbye to the askewniverse. It will be greatly missed. Society need someone who is not afraid to make fun of both it and himself. Only downside to this film is for those who haven't seen all of the others and won't understand all the inside jokes.
