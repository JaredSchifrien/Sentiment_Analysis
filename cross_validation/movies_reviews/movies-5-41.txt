The first and probobly the best of the INDY Trilogy, I could watch it over and over. The whole trilogy is spectacular (Temple of Doom is my least favorite, however) and the character of Indiana Jones is a real person, portrayed perfectly by the classic Harrison Ford. The general Ideas in this movie make it wonderful, and although the special affects are not exactly up to par with the 2003 stuff, they are still very good, esspecially for the time when it was made. plus, the one-liners are great.
