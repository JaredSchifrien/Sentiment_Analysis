My favorite movie of all time! This movie was NOT ridiculous, and the soundtrack was NOT weak. Is it a crime for someone to be silly? Is it horrible that I laughed out loud? There are so many great scenes in there, and the boys get to be themselves, which is great. It shows the younger generation(like me), how Beatlemania really was. The performances are really great. I especially love the Can't Buy Me Love number out on the field. I have a question for all of you who gave this movie less than 5 stars, I'm 13, would you rather me watch a hilarious Beatles movie, or some X-rated movie?
