What a great horror film! My favorite kind of horror is the kind that isn't afraid to have a laugh. This one has many laughs that in return, magnify the horror. Two friends from America are attacked by a werewolf and you like these two guys! David and Jack seem like nice, funny guys! Two guys I wouldn't mind hanging out with. Anyway, You don't want either of them to get hurt. Not to give away too much plot, both of the men's lives change drastically after this encounter and things will never be the same again. Horror and comedy blend to make this a very enjoyable and unique film experience. For those of you who might judge this movie before seeing based on the horrid sequel, An American Werewolf in Paris, rest assured this is a completly different film. Paris is more of a fairy tale, while London is a more realistic (as far as fictional werewolf horror films go) take on the whole situation and London relise on REAL special effects, as in were actually there and not added in later by a couple of guys with computer. Amrican Werewolf in London is a classic and highly under rated for such a sharply written and original werewolf film. Never before or since have I seen such a good werewolf movie. Take a look and I garuntee zero disapointment. It is easy for me to garuntee,see, because I don't make it a money back one and anyways you don't know where I live soooo you're going to have to deal if you have no sense of humor and don't really like horror films. I must say I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOTION PICTURE!
