Alright, I'll admit it. I'm a Star Wars geek, although granted I don't have a room in my house dedicated to it and I didn't sleep on the sidewalk to get tickets to the latest three travesties. That being said, I do love Star Wars. Despite mediocre acting and special effects that are now considered laughable, I find myself still enjoying it. Its uncomparable to other sci-fi flicks because it started the genre and is still the hallmark of the genre. Its fun, entertaining and has made George Lucas a ridiculously wealthy man.
