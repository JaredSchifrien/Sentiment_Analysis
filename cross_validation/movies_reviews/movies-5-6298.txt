A great movie. Audrey Hepburn was good as Eliza Doolittle a flower girl who meets Henry Higgins a prefessor of language. Higgins boasts he could even teach a flower girl to act and speak proper. Eliza ends up staying with Higgins while he teaches her to speak and be a proper lady.Rex harrison is also good as the arrogant Higgins. Who by the end of the movie has grown to care for Eliza. Lots of good songs. Just a charming story that came from the Book Pygmalion. The scene at the horse race was especially cute.
