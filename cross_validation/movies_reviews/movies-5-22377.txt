This movie easily amazed me when I first saw it. The dark atmosphere it projected was beautiful, and the presentation of the alien was excellent. You never really saw the whole alien in a single scene, which gave for a mysterious feeling. At the alien was an original concept. The birth and life cycle or the creature seemed very original to me. And this movie had a good story. The reason I like this movie more than the others was because Sigourny Weaver wasn't the glorified heroine. She was just another equal member of the crew trying to survive.
