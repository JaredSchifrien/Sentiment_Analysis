Ok everyone gather round' while i tell u a tale a tale of the legend of John Rambo. Rambo (Stallone) was a vietnam war hero veteran, who during war saw all his friends get annahilated. He had no family and nowhere to go, the war vets were thought of as baby killers and other vile crap. Rambo went to visit his old budy that survived but wouldnt you know it, cancer ate him down to the bone, so having nowhere to go he heads for Bumtown (Portland) on his way there he gets picked up for vagrancy in a small jerkwater town by the sheriff. As u can guess Rambo didnt want a ride outta town so they booked him for resisting arrest. they take him in and "F" with the wrong guy, he escapes and heads up into the forest and hides out up there while everyone and their dogs (literally) hunt his ass down. But big John is hard to find (War experience) well i dont want to give away the ending so go see this if you havnt, before Rambo comes for you!!! "he drew first blood".
