Reading everyones comments about the Patriot. I feel some was right and wrong about the movie. All I could say about the movie, it has spoken well. To show us all what really happen durring the war. I feel that the character Col. Travington was only doing his duty and also showing his true feelings about the war. I thought that this movie was very emotional. Sure the british soldier was wrong about burning the church with innocent folks, but who was higher in rank to stop him from burning innocent folks. So I say it was the Gerneral's fault who allow him to do what he was good at a evil valiant . But this is only a movie and I feel Jason Isaacs has perform very well and I hope he got paid good, for his work.
