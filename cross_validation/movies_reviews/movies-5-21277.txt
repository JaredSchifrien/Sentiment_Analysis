Viva Las Vegas is the greatest! OK Elvis movies tend not to be great pieces of art, but the dude exudes charisma. The great thing about VIVA is that Ann Margaret is almost able to upstage The King. I didn't think it was possible -- but check her out as she duets The Lady Loves Me... But She Doesn't Know It Yet. It's just classic. Ann Margaret forever!!
