Very good original story done all with computers. I just loved this movie about toys that come to life when the humans are not around. Woody is a toy cowboy who is devoted to his Kid Andy. Woody is Andy's favorite toy until Buzz Lightyear comes and now Woody feels he has lost Andy. Woody wants to get rid of Buzz. this only backfires and both end up at Sids a boy who loves to destroy toys. Now they must work together to get away from Sid and back to Andy who will be moving away.This is a family movie all ages can enjoy. We all loved the movie and found it to be very funny and entertaining. There are some good actors providing the voices such as Tom Hanks and Tim Allen.
