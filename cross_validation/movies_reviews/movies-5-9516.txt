One of the more funny modern non-Disney comedy movies that I have recently seen, this one is great with the antics of Chris Rock and the sometimes-Deadpan, sometimes over-the-top comedic timing of Jackie Chan. Although not as good as the Jackie Chan cartoon, Jackie Chan Adventures, it is still a good movie with lots of funny dialogue and fight scenes. I wish they hadn't used bad language, however.
