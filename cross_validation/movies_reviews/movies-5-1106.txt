A great classic about an immigrant drug dealer who works his way up to the top by being aggressive and not letting anyone get in his way. But it is this attitude which leads to his downfall - he will not listen to even his closest friends. He becomes extremely self-consumed and careless, and his high coke intake doesn't help. In the end the invincible Tony Mantana falls as quickly as he had risen.
