Well written script, where all characters were fully realized. The audience got to understand each character's motivations and desires and fears. Very interesting to watch the main character, Will Hunting, because he was so complex. He was violent and vulgar on the one hand, but a genius and funny on the other. This movie had a great message underlying: everyone should find their potential, we shouldn't waste our lives because we are only alive for a short time.
