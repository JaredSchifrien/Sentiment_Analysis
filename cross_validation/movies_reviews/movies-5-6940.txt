Airplane is one movie you don't want to miss. It is so funny and fast-paced, that you have to call it a classic. Ted Striker and Elaine Dickenson are 2 former sweethearst that end up on the same plane. The plane is full of a group of eccentric characters including: a singing nun, a heart-transplant patient, 2 gay arabian men, an inflatable pilot, and a doctor who doesn't want to be called Surely.
