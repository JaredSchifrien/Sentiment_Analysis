It's a tale that is part of mankind's history as well as mankind's present. It speaks of the intolerance of man for viewpoints contrary to their beliefs. It's about closed-mindedness. And it's a real chapter out of America's history, down to nearly the exact words from the testimory of William Jennings Bryan as questioned by Clarence Darrow. And with Frederick March and Spencer Tracy as portraying Bryan and Darrow respectively, what more can you ask of a movie. From one of the great plays in American theatre written by Robert E. Lee (no relation) and Jerome Lawrence. See it...it may change your thinking...it may change your life.
