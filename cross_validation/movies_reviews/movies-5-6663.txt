Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier truly deserved their academy award nominations in their roles as The Defiant Ones (as did the brilliant screenplay and cinematography). Through their conflicting relationship and evolving friendship as two convicts on the run, Curtis and Poitier expose common prejudices against black people. The humanistic message of the story is delivered in a touching, believable and non-preachy manner. Less pretentious and obvious than many of the movies dealing with racial issues which would follow.
