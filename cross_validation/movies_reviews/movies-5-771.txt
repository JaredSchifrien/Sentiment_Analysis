I like M. Night Shymalan's films. So far, Sixth Sense has been his best. It is creepy and suspenseful. Excellent acting from Haley Joel Osment, Toni Collete (a personal favorite), and even Bruce Willis. Like Rocky, the secret star of this movie is the city of Philadelphia. Being an old and kind of foreboding town, the film works exceptionally well there as opposed to, let's say, San Diego. The ending kind of caught me by surprise (which I won't spoil for the 1% of you who have not seen it yet). I will say, when watching it a second time, it was quite obvious. Worthwhile DVD rental.
