Regardless of your religious beliefs and convictions, from an acting and visual perspective, it was amazing. Jim Caviezel (did I spell that correctly?) was amazing, and the movie is very thought provoking. It was a masterpiece in my opinion; having said that, it isn't a movie you could pop in at any given time. I'm not going to rant and rave about biblical fact or fiction, or how Mel is anti-Semitic, or that it was too Catholic as I seem to keep hearing. Look, none of us were there, but from my opinion of what happened, I thought it very accurate of what I thought it must've been like. For the people who say it was too violent...what did you expect, the masses to sing and frolic with Jesus while he walks to his death? It was savage, yes, but come on people!!! Was Jesus' crucifiction a beautiful act to watch? Hello!!! Did you think the Roman soldiers were going to kindly tap Him with a whip, while they carefully and delicately placed his hand gently against the wood of the cross? Or make a clean, surgical laceration into his side? We have heard it so often, it almost becomes like lyrics to a popular song. For me, it brought meaning back to the words of the gospel and the prayers I say. Other people say that there was no plot, just Jesus getting beaten. Let me clue you in on something...THAT IS THE PLOT! What did you think the plot was going to be about, the Healing of the Paralytic? Some people want to turn the crucifiction into some kind of beautiful and humane act...well, it wasn't...Sorry. It's not a movie for everyone, and I know this, but this website is about your opinion. I thought it was amazing. The Aramaic and Latin added to it for me. I don't know if anyone else has read other reviews and polls, but some of these clowns who claim to have been laughing while Christ was being tortured, I WISH you would've been in the theater with me.
