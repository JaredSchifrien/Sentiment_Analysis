Chris Farley at his best. I swear that Farley and Spade's chemistry equates that of Steve Martin and John Candy in Planes, Trains and Automobiles . This movie really was hilarious and has some scenes that I will never forget (i.e. when he's giving the demonstration with the businessman's model cars). Th deer scene was also hilarious, not to mention the cow-tipping scene. A very funny movie! RIP Chris Farley!
