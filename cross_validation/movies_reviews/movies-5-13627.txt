What appealed to me about this movie is that the focus of racism is from the other side of the fence, which is very rare in film. We see a young white racist thug and the hate he emulates from his father's view on life and eventually anger over his father's death. This hate and anger spirals as a contributing factor to his downfall and passes onto his brother. What I also liked about this film is that Ed Norton's character can see that his brother Danny is a mirror image of himself before he went into prison and he knows in order for Danny to get through life he needs to change it as hate will not conquer all.
