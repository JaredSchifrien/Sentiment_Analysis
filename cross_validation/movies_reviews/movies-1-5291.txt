Doesnt make the grade. This move is unsuitable for little children yet too childish for adults. The troupe is knocked out by poppies. An educated person can tell that poppies are the producers of opium. So it implies that these heroes are really druggies. These loveable charecters whom children want to be like influence them to do things the majority of them might not have done if this movie was not shown to them.
