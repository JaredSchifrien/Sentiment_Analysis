I had wanted to see this movie but I had heard that it was in subtitles and whenever I was in the video store, I couldn't bear to get a movie with subtitles but one day I finally rented it. It wasn't in subtitles. Only a fraction of the story is in subtitles. The movie is the history of a violin through time, from the making to today. It is a great story and done so well that it keeps you attention. You really get a feel for the characters. I really recommend this movie to anyone.
