A movie so good that it continues to grow an audience with each new generation that is exposed to it. An ensemble cast with brilliantly played characters and an unforgettable soundtrack. The message of the film, "There's no place like home.", is one that resonates inside the hearts of all who are fortunate enough to enjoy the love of home, friends, and family, the world over. To think that they nearly left Judy Garland's emotionally charged rendition of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' on the cutting room floor makes you thankful for occurences of devine intervention. A true classic for all times.
