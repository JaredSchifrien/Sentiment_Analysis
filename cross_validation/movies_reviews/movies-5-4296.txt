I've always loved watching this one. Until recently I didn't realize how old some of these Disney movies are- Peter Pan came out in 1953! The animation quality is amazing and it's crazy to think that it was made 50 years ago without computers or anything. Other things I've noticed are that the same voice actor does the voices for Captain Hook and Mr. Darling and that when Wendy, Michael and John are thinking of merry little thoughts during their flight training, they mention mermaid lagoons, pirate ships, and Indians, I believe- all of which are in Neverland. So I suppose they kind of created Neverland to be what it was. Great movie (if you can get past that If There's A Star in Your Heart song that plays at the beginning credits that never ceases to disgust me) with a great message. It's got action, humor, everything.
