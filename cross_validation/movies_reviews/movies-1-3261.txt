John Woo did better work when he made low budget flicks with unknown actors and actresses. The worst performance in this movie goes to the bad guy, he just isn't evil enough and just isn't any good at being evil. Tom Cruise isn't much better as a hero, nowhere near as good as the first one. Best Scene: I can't think of any.
