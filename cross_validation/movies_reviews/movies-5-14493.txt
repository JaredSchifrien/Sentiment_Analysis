I was really impressed with 'Almost Famous'. It had a lot of starting out actors but they were all fantastic. The story is about a high school guy who is a really good writer. He gets a job with Rolling Stone (RS has no idea he is so young) to write a story about an up and coming band. He goes on tour with them but along the way a story that is sad, funny, exciting, adventerous, and romantic develops. This movie had it all. One thing I look for in a good movie whether it is a horror, romantic comedy, or an action adventure movie is if I get attacthed to the characters. 'Almost Famous' did the job. I was into all the characters. It has so many different messages intertwined in the movie. The music is amazing with a lot of Led Zeppelin. It is a really good date movie. I have just heard some breaking news this weekend about 'Almost Famous' that I had to come back and share. This news makes me like the movie ten times more now. This movie is based upon the directors life. He used to write for Rolling Stone magazine and follow bands like Zeppelin around when he was a teenager. There really is a Penny Lane. This news has changed my rating and I now have to give it a 5 start rating.
