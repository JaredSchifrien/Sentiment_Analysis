I personally thought that the movie was really good. It was so intense. I can't see how a movie based on such a great book by Stephen King could be bad. The acting was very decent I thought. And one of the things that made the movie so great is the fact that it is scary, funny, intense and dramatic all at the same time. The special effects were really good and didn't seem like a multiplication (unlike Matrix Reloaded). Overall, I think that Dreamcatcher is totally worth seeing (in spite of what Callmetootie might say)
