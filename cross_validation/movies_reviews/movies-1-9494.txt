The best thing about South Park on TV is that they push the envelope and I love that. This movie is just awful it had no redeaming value what so ever. It was out to shock and disgust and it was really just sad. The guy could have come up with a much better plot. Terrenance and Phillip suck on the show they should have never been in the movie.
