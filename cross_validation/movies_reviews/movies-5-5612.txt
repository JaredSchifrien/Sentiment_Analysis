Indeed one of my favorite Hitchcock movies, right next to "the Birds". Stewart and Kelly are lovely opposite one another, and rewatching it after a few years, the film was still as suspenseful and intriguing as I first remembered it. When you can revisit a film after a couple of years, to find it as fresh and exciting as you did initially shows the films true quality!
