I just saw it a few hours ago, and I thought it was brilliant. Sure some of the scenes were a little iq less ? I was sitting on the edge of my seat for 2/10's of the movie, and I never sit on the edge of my seat ! I have never seen big waves in the ocean and I felt like I was right there. The only real problem I had was the sound track... they could have had another Titanic soundtrack with the romance...they blew that...now there are no songs I can listen to, to remind me of the movie, ugh . I liked it and I am sure I will see it on video 2-3 more times.
