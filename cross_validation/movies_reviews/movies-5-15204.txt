Since I'm towards the other end of the generation scale, I origionally only saw this movie to see what Chris O'Donnell did before Batman and Circle Of Friends. As usual I was impressed by his peformance but I was pleasently suprised by Al Pacino who is way before my time. I loved this movie and it has taught me to appreciate the effort of older actors rather than all the teen flicks I'm used too.
