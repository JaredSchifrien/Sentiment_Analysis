This would be my number one reason for learning Italian, to fully understand every single word that comes from his (Robert's) mouth. Not many movies will make me cry, but this one did, I cant make me cry anymore, after seeing it 25 plus times, but I'm equally moved every time. Its fair to divided the movie into 2 chapters, The first one, is Guido (Roberto ) winning his love. The second chapter is about Roberto trying to protect his son from the horror of WW2. But much more, this is a tale about life, about love. Roberto is simply irresistible. His appetite for life is astonishing, breathtaking, the overall acting of all the characters are superb, and the music melt in. Maybe not the greatest movie ever, but darn close! 5 stars of 5.
