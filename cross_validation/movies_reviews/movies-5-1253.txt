Anyone who says this movie is bad was ether not paying attention or couldn't look past the violence. this movie was very smart and phycological. it was full of all worlds: comedy, drama, suspense, irony and crime. but the real thing that made this movie good was the character building, all of the(what ignorant people call pointless ) conversations between the main characters build a sort of warm, smart, and different type of gangster in which we have never seen before and this is what makes Terintino the mastermind of a genius. If you can look past the violence, this movie is full of halarious irony and incredible acting. my favorite of all time and one of the best!
