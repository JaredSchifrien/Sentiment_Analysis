I absolutely love this film. There are only about 20 movies in my collection that I watch over and over, and this is one of them. I like the ambience/atmosphere/sense of place that the makers of this film have created for both Earth and for Mars. Okay, some of the science in the film is wrong, but who cares? If you want science, don't look at sci-fi movies, because there is little there. You think there is actual physics in a transporter beam? Ha! I like the interaction of the characters in MTM, and there is a very sweet romantic relationship between a married couple. There is also an interesting character who has lost his wife. The only thing that irritates me about the movie is that whoever did the make-up was too heavy-handed with the eye make-up in certain scenes.
