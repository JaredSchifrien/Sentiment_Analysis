The best in the series and the best movie ever! When you see the words STAR WARS at the beginning and you hear that music than you know your watching a classic. This movie is my favorite movie of all time because it had loads of wonderful special effects, excellent humor, colorful characters and an intriging story that always will be rewatchable. If you don't like this movie then I have pity on you!
