A truly uproarious slapstick comedy from the late 50s, Some Like it Hot provides humor on all ends of the spectrum, but is never really dirty! From physical slapstick, verbal jokes, subtle flirt humor and ridicoulous situations. It would be almost impossible not to laugh at least once during this classic!
