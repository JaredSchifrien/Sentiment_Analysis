all of you listen: A nightmare on elm street is the best horror movie in history. I never saw an horror movie like that.Not even now with all the tech things that producers have.. A nightmare on elm street was made first in 87..then got along the 90s. i remember watching the movies,was i a kid.. i had about 8,9years when i watched movies from him..with my older brother and parents.. i dreamed about it.. every time when i was sick,with fever..everynight..i dreamed the same dream..i was in the hospital..and freddy would come for me..grabbing me in a leg..and takin me away..everynight..i think ive a trauma with that.. so dont say Freddy Krueger is s*** cuz it aint. i Just registered to write that.
