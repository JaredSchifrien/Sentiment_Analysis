I thought it was scary but I love to scare myself so it was worth it. I sorta thought it was funny when stupid ghost don't know their dead! M. Night Shymalan went a little far making this happen to a child. SPOILER AHEAD : HERE IT IS BRUCE WILLIS IS DEAD. I guess it is stupid of me to be shocked when it happend but I was!
