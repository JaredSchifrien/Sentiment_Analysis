all the right elements are in the mix: the pace is fast without being confusing, the humor dry and witty, the action exciting and suspenceful. if anything is missing its the over-blown (and obvious) computer graphics and clich√©s of a doomed futuristic world that have become the standard for sci-fi (or any other summer blockbuster, for that matter). rather, this is an actual story of people with complicated pasts and uncertain futures; it just happens to be set in outer space. this movie should become the touchstone for all movies, but especially sci-fi, wherein the focus is on how each particular person -- in keeping with his character -- reacts to the action and environment.
