A great movie. Jack Lemmon if perfect as the guy who works for a huge office.He lets other men use his apartment for affairs. In hope of a promotion one of the men he lets use his apartment is one of the big wigs Played by Fred MacMurray{playing a creep this time} The woman FRed has an affair with is played by Shirley MacClaine, Jacks character really likes this woman. He ends up helping her out during a very low point in her life. Now he wants her for himself even if it means no promotion and going against his creep of a boss. VEry well acted all around especially by Jack Lemmon as the put upon guy.
