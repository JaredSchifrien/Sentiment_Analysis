Is this the fate of TV comedy in ten years? This disguisting waste of film didn't deserve to be made, especially into a useless sequel. These sex-centered teen movies show what teens shouldn't do. Whatever happened to good old clean comedy? Now, I'm no prude, but is anything besides sex funny? Of course it is! Take a look at Beverly Hillbillies, I Love Lucy on TV or Toy Story 2, Some Like it Hot as far as Movies. Rated R, which is an underrate in my opinion.
