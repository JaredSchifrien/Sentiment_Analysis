This belongs in the top 20. American Pie is above this? Give me a break! This is Jim Carrey's funniest movie, and I've seen it 100 times and I still laugh every time. I'll never forget when the cop drinks Jim Carrey's beer . Absolutely hilarious. You wanna hear the most annoying sound in the world? AAAAAHHHHH.
