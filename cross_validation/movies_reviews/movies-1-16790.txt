One of the most disappointing movies I can recall. Jack gave the worst performance of his career and it was a herendously slow boring movie. Character development is one thing but just showing a guy fishing isn't really entertaining. The first ten minutes were exciting and then I guess Penn decided all the action was used up. My friend that watched it with me, fell asleep for the first time ever watching a movie in the theater. If you haven't seen it, make a pledge to yourself not to do so.
