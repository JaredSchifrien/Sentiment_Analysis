I'v seen it about 4 times since it opened back in 1985. It is creative and an incredible fusion of comedy and SCI-FI. Great Catchphrases galore(McFlyyyyy). I loved the way the BTTF trilogy was able to work in Biff landing in a huge pile of s--t in every film. I watched it with my family yesterday and the kids (10 and 8) loved it. I guess the one gripe is that the movie has a lot of profanity for a PG movie. PG-13 is more appropriate. And my wife gave me copious amounts of grief about that. Like what the F--- does she want me to get them, Barney meets The Teletubbies. As if my kids haven't heard worse in school. Of course, my boy doesn't help things by calling the girl, Butthead.
