MGM's 1951 version is my favorite musical of all time. Ava Gardner is great as the beautiful, drunken Julie. And Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson are in perfect voice as Gay and Magnolia. Add to that Joe E Brown as Cap'n Andy, and William Warfield singing Ol' Man River, and this Show Boat is moving along the mighty Mississip with a stern-full of wonderful melodies!
