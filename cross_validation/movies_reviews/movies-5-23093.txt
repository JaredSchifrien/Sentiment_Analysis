Although not as powerful as the original 3 movies, Lucas does a great job with the special effects and scenery in this movie. The landscape, not to mention Natalie Portman, are beautiful. All the other cast members, Liam Nesson, Ewan McGregor, and Ray Parks are perfectly casted. Jar Jar Binks however, deserves to die.
