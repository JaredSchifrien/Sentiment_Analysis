Obviously one of the greatest, but definitly it won't appeal to all people. This is cleary a dialogue movie, meaning that most of the movie consists of just dialogue, whether in a car, at a house, or at a bar. But don't get the wrong impression from this. There is great action at the right times and there are a huge amount of famous actors/actresses in this film. Definitly not my favorite, but right up there.
