Rarely does a movie hold enough suspense to draw a scream from my throat, this was an exception...and mine was not the only one heard. A script full of incredible plot twists, haunting images and a total surprise ending had me. The Hitchcocish camera angles and overall cinematography resurrected the horrors of psycho and other such films. I totally enjoyed the change from the typical roles normally played by both Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfiefer.
