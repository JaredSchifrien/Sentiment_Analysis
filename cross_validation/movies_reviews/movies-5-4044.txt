I have always loved this sweet little tale about Lady the pampered cocker spaniel and Tramp the homeless mutt. their worlds were different until they came together when the nasty aunt who was babysitting {while Lady's owners were out of town}tried to put a collar on Lady. They ran away . the scene at the restaurant where they share a plate of spaghetti is precious. there are other dog characters too. Peg the dog the dog who has been around some humerous scenes some sad. Of course all ends well with a happy ending and a new home for Tramp.cute Disney I loved from my childhood and still enjoy.
