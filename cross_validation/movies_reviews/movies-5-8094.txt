i've seen this film a ton. a stoner sage of The Dude as played by Jeff Bridges, who is marvelous, at his comedic best. The film is also superbly written by the Coen brothers. The only film of theirs that matches the amount of quotable lines for me is Oh Brother, where art thou. Lebowksi is also superbly acted by John Goodman and Steve Buscemi. people tend to slag of comedy but making people laugh is a hard game. if sublime and dark humor are what you like the movie is for you. if a good Meg Ryan comedy is your game, i'd stay away. It really tied the room together, man.
