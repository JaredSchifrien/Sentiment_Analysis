This classic action flick would be the best of all time if it were not for it's follower- The Last Crusade. It stars Harrison Ford and Karen Allen ( who is at her sexiest ) in the quest for the Ark of the Covenant. Special effects are superb, the story line is marvelous and the action and suspense are taut. Go rent it immediately.
