The First time WENT to see the RHPS was on my 14th B-Day with my mom and 17yr old brother.. Damn was it AWSOME! I really didn't Dress up, but I wore eye shadow (Thanks to my 24 year old sister) I didn'y know what to say, but I still had a Great time.. 2 every one who hasn't seen it Live, I suggest you go out and see it.. U will love it.
