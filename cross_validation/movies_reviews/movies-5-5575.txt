When something has entered the consciousness as deeply as Casablanca has - everyone from Woody Allen (Play It Again Sam) to The Simpsons has riffed on it - it becomes a film that many younger film fans can talk about and quote from, even though few have probably seen it. This is something which should be rectified immediately as it's much more fun than its stuffy The Greatest Film Ever Made tag suggests, with a literate script, stylish direction, a great song and the cinema's most romantic couple in Bogie and Bergman. A must-see and one of the greatest. Summary: ONE OF THE GREATEST FILMS EVER MADE, AWESOME!
