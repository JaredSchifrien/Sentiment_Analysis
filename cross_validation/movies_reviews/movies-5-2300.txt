The Bourne Supremacy was my favorite movie of 2004. The Bourne Identity was a great movie, and there was a lot of hype for the Bourne Supremacy, and I think the sequel lived up to and probably even surpassed the first. I'm already looking forward to the Bourne Ultimatum which is scheduled to be made in the next few years.
