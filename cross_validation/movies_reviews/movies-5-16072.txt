OH MY GOSH!!!! John Q is by far the best movie ever!! If I could I would give this movie like a gazillion stars .. if I could... My friends and I cried throughout the whole thing.. It showed real love, courage, bravery, and if you can believe it humor.. Mostly humor from Eddie Griffith.. eheh I luv that lil guy.. Nehoo, Denzel Washington is tha best actor.. This movie showed his real skills.. not like his others didn't because.. believe me I'm a huge fan of them!! John Q is about a man who's son has an oversized heart and the son won't live unless the hospital gets him on a list for a new heart.. John, his wife, and his son have two options.. They can either take him home... give him the love he needs until one morning he won't wake up :(.. or the other choice is that they can do the surgery.. w/ a chance that the boy may not live.. They decide to do the surgery, but the family does not have enough money to cover it.. The hospital will not put the boy's name on the list until the family come up with the money.. John and his wife struggle to get some money.. They get a lot of what they need so far.. but the hospital decides that the kid is going to go home... John Q doesn't stand for this and takes over the emergency room... I will not bury my son.. My son will bury me! That is a quote from the movie.. From then on this movie has twists, turns, and one hell of an ending!! John Q will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time... It is such a beautiful movie.. Every actor in this movie is perfect.. They show real emotion and feeling.. It's just great.. I am in love with this movie!! Denzel better win like every award or this! It is soo great!!! Go see it everyone!!! (I swear girls.. don't wear mascara to this movie!!) Luvs!
