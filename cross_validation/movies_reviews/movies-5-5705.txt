Some people have some real nerve not to give this a five star rating. Yes, it's long. But, it's glorious in its length, scope, and feeling. Not the greatest film of all time, but probably the most famous. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable in roles that defined their careers. Heart-rending final act, and many unforgettable scenes along the way (like the harrowing Civil War parts). One of the films everyone, EVERYONE, must see in their lifetime.
