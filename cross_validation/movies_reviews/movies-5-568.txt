This is a throwback to the 50s and 60s.One can almost imagine Humphrey Bogart in this. Bryan Singer did an excellant job with this movie. One of my all time favorites this should have taken the Oscar for best picture.Twisting and turning constantly this is a movie that gets better with repeated viewings.
