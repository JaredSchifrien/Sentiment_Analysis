Audrey Tatou is practically edible in this film. It's about a whole lot of somethings/nothings (mostly in Amelie's head). Great use of voiceover narrative as a comedic device--the main character has minimal dialogue yet her expressions married with the narrative lead to outrageous laughter. A cute love story. And the lawn gnome! LOL!!!
