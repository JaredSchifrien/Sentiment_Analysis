I have never been so bored in all my life. All talent used in this movie was wasted. The plot was lacking, the idea itself was lacking, all the characters lacked. This movie never gets off the ground. It seems to sit on its keyster and through out sperattic action hostage flick cliches. But, they are clever when they do this. By boring you to tears a little explosion or a motorist getting blown to bits by machine gun fire is a welcome happening even though it adds nothing to the film. My advice STAY FAR FAR AWAY.
