No matter how many Scream movies will be made, they will all be horrible. Every 'unexpected' spook and fright can be seen a mile away. When someone is walking through the dark and the camera is on close-up, of course the chick will turn around to find someone there. Don't go to get scared. You should take your girl, so she can hold on to you.
