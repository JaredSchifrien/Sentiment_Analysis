The Wedding Singer is an extremly well made movie, and it deserves so much credit for what went into it. It has the best lines, and Adam Sandler has an excellent role as Robbie Hart. It takes place in 1985, in a small suburban town and Robbie falls in love with Julie, who is getting married to a rat, who is cheating on her, but he's rich and Robbie's a poor wedding singer, but Julie likes Robbie better but is too nervous to tell him.
