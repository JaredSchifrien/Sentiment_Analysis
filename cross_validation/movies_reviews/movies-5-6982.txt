The smart humor combines with the crazy antics of Ferris Bueller will leave you laughing in your sleep. This is the kind of movie you will always remember watching and always want to watch it again. I don't think I came across one person who said they didn't find this movie at least amusing. It kind of makes you want to cut school and take your best friend's dad's car out and sing in a parade.
