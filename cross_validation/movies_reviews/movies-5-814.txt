Wow. AS soon as the movie was at its resolution, I knew it was a good movie. The end, however, left me stunned and speechless. The people who made this movie couldn't have done any better. The little boy (what was his name?) should definetly appear in more movies. I believe he is very talented (even more talented than some of the actors today). Bruce Willis's acting speaks for itself. He's wonderful, as always!
