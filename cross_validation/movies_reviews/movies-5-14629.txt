I thought this movie was going to be a typical whodunit, but this movie surprised me by having many layers. Sean Penn earned his Best Actor Oscar with his skillful portrayal of Jimmy, whose daughter is murdered. Jimmy is more complex than he appears at the beginning of the movie, and is not just a grieving dad. Penn's acting in this movie convinced me that he is the Marlon Brando of my generation. Tim Robbins is also deserving of praise as the psychologically scarred Dave, who is still trying to come to grips with a childhood trauma. Tim Robbins portrays Dave as a sensitive, but wounded, gentle giant. I agree with a previous poster who stated that Mystic River should have won Best Picture and Best Director. Mystic River posesses an immediacy that a dopey fable like Lord of the Rings sadly lacks.
