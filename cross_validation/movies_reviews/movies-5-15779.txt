This is a tremendous movie and one that is often overlooked when it comes to the greatest sports movies of all-time. Dennis Christopher is great as the main character whose cycling dreams are discouraged (to say the least) by his dad and tolerated / encouraged by his friends. Breaking Away is a sports movie, a buddy flick, a study of father/son relationships, and a love story all in one. It may be a little slow for some, but check it out if you've never seen it. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
