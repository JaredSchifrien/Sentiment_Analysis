One of the greatest concepts in music history. All the credit to Pink Floyd (especially Roger Waters) for coming up with such an amazing album. From that album, came a blockbuster movie. When I think of Allan Parker, Fame, Commitments may come in mind to some. However, this movie outdoes them all as far as Parker's directing skills go. Truly one for the ages.
