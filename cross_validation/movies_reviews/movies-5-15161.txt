Renee Zellweger's charm is enough for me to love this movie. I have seen this movie more than 20 times, but whenever I see it, I find what a luck it is that Renee got this role. Cameron Diaz? Mimi Rogers? Mira Sorvino? No. If they had played Dorothy Boyd, Jerry Maguire might be just so-so. Anyway, Tom Cruise was good, Cuba Gooding Jr. even better, and the kid, Jonathan Lipnicki was great.
