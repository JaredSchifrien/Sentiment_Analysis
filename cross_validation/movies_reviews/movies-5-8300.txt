The guy who came up with the premise of the movie and directed it is actually a Christian - so aryandan get your facts correct before you b***h about something that you don't really know anything about. I think its a very clever film and I do like the main thrust of the film being that religion is an idea that should grow rather than using religion as a weapon against the things that you don't approve of or are frightened of. its a very sweet film and does raise a lot of questions and ideas that perhaps some people should take on board
