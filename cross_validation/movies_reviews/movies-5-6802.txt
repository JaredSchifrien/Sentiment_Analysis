Released in 1974, Monty Python And The Holy Grail is the first film from the famed British comedy troupe. This movie is not for everyone as the British humor is a specific taste, the movie is very low production, and the screenplay is irreverent and full of odd animation. The story has our group of comedians Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin playing King Arthur and his knights as they tackle life during the Middle Ages and search for the Holy Grail. The film is full of classic lines and non-sequiturs as it rapidly fluctuates back and forth from the mundane (eg bantering political theory with peasants and deciding on how to spot a witch) to the grandiose (eg a Trojan Rabbit and a magically guarded bridge). Much like the Arthurian Legends themselves, the movie is much like a collection of related short stories as the various knights go on their separate quests and then reunite for the final challenge and an abrupt conclusion. The bottom line is that Monty Python And The Holy Grail has become a cult classic and right of passage that must be seen at least once.
