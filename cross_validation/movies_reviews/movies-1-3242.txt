This is just about the worst Bond movie ever. To say the plot is flimsy would be to grossly overstate the existence of a plot. The casting belongs on the TV, or a Channel 4 low budget film - Robert Carlyle as a Bond bad guy? I don't think so - Robbie Coltrane and Goldie (??????) - nuff said. Only Judi Dench has the screen quality, but she comes across like your headmistress from school, not your boss. Bonds got worse when Harry Saltzman left (died?), worse still when they ran out of books to base the plots on, and have hit an absolute nadir now Cubby Broccoli isn't involved. Give up - Not another - This was a shameful exploitation to hide the lack of a plot by having an action sequence ever five minutes. And I just can't suspend disbelief any longer - Bond films started in the 1962, which assuming he was around 30 then makes him about 70 by now. They also belong in that era, when the Cold War threat actually did exist, and films such as From Russia, Goldfinger etc had some degree of plausibility. Loons like Carlyle, Jonathan Pryce and Sean Bean just do not have any credibility in the modern, post Glasnost era.
