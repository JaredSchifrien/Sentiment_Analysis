This movie is the ultimate role model for other Sci-Fi movies. It has a cool storyline which is out of this world. I mean the machines trap humans in computers to generate energy, and in order to do that they make the computer-generated dreamworld called the matrix, and they are making the humans believe that this dreamworld is real. I mean wow, i would never come up with an idea like that. The graphics alone is a pioneer of its kind. The bullet timing effect is famous since this movie came out. The fight scenes are very well choreographed. And Keanu Reeves' acting is up a notch, so what more can i say!
