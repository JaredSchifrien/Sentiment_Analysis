The most offensive piece of garbage that I have ever seen and that's saying a lot considering that I don't get offended easily. That's all that I can say about this movie. I'm sorry but I fail to see what makes this movie brilliant or even interesting. I felt nothing for the characters and didn't really care about the epic battle between the irish and the natives .
