This film was very special for me! I felt like it was me that had written the manus or maybe it was me that the movie was about? The reason was that the topics of the film, like what if everyone knows what you're doing all the time? etc. was thoughts I've had a lot of as a child! One of the greatest movies at all time! :o)
