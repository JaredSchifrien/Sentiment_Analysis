For me this movie was really worth watching. Of course I have an advantage since I've lived a year in Chile speak English fluently, but most parts was however hard to get because the Mexican slang was very commonly in this movie. Of that reason the text became essential to me, but unfortunately this is a quite white movie, so most of the time it was almost impossible to read the text. So as you see the pictures became the most important part of my experience. And I liked it! Not immediately, but after a while I got a huge sympathy for many of the characters, like the brother who was in love with his sister the old guerillero who got a chance to see his daughter again couldn't stop thinking of her. The movie had it's funny touchy parts! Well worth watching! And I learned a new slang for 'money': In Chile we say 'plata' (silver), obviously in Mexico they say lana (wool). :-)
