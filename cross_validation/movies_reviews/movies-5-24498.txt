Although I'm scratching my head at the PG-13 rating for this tame movie, I must say I enjoyed it throughly (to my surprise, both my parents enjoyed it as well!). As a fan of the cartoon series (I had never seen the first movie), I was not dissappointed. Big aliens, hilarious banter and pop references (from Star Trek to The Weather Channel) are just awesome. Plus, on the DVD, the blooper reel rocks! Highly recommended!
