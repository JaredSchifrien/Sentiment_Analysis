This is the all time horror movie of all horrors! It is about a relm in which we all either disagree and agree to whether it exists or not. A child being possessed by a demon?! How unearthly can a MOVIE get. It is also based on a real live true stroy. I dont know all the facts, but that to me tell me a little something about all the demons of this earth. And how powerful the darkside really can be. Linda Blair had some definate big ones to do such a role. I know I couldnt. But to be honest-----does the darkside work in the way the movie says it does??? Rent it or whatever you have to do, but this is a must see movie. (Especially since Halloween is on its way)
