So far, the most satisfying effort from the Brothers Coen. I usually refrain from describing something as "genius", but this picture comes as close as possible, as it's a study of the mundane bordered by entwined extremes (wildly engaging characters and the sordid situations that involve them, with the plebian calm of the bowling alley serving as a familiar center). Even when you think it's straying into the inexplicable, it kicks you back onto the rail and sends you rollicking along into the next hilarious set-up (how it all ties together is borderline-magnificent; you feel as if you haven't been watching a movie so much as somebody's bad day working itself out). How can anyone recommend something that's sleazy (cameos by Ben Gazzara, John Turturro), sexy (Julianna Moore and Tara Reid), sweet (a great change-of-pace for Steve Buscemi), and surreal (the Cosmic Lane/Pin Girls dream sequence is one for the ages), all at the same time? True cinemaphiles are miles ahead of this review (nodding in rapt appreciation); hungry novices are enthusiastically encouraged to purchase the DVD and prepare for one of the best theatrical releases of the last five years.
