Exhilarating Entertainment, particularly the opening fight scene between two women on the rooftop that took my breath away. It is a tossup between this and Gladiator as to which is BEST PICTURE of the year. This has everything in it -- action sequences never before put on film, two love stories, mysticism, teen rebellion. Ang Lee himself described this as Sense and Sensibility with martial arts. People don't realize that Lee brought together some of the greatest talent in the world. Michael Yeoh, who should have been nominated for an Academy Award, and Chow Yun Fat, are not only the biggest stars in Asia but have appeared in big American studio movies. The man who choreographed the fight scenes has been called the best in the business for his work on The Matrix , but what he has done here goes way beyond that. And all of the lines in movie, delivered in Mandarin, had to be learned from scratch by ALL the actors, none of whom knew the language previously. See it and believe it.
