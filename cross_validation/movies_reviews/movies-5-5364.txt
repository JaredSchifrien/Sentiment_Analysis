This is another John Ford work. The story takes place in a Welsh mining town and is the story of a large family's interactions. The Welshmen singing Cym Rhondda is fantastic. It is fun to compare that hymn here with the same hymn in the African Queen. Donald Crisp plays the patriarch of a large family of coal miners, and this is a moving account of that family. Crisp won a well-deserved Oscar.
