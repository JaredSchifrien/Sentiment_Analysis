This movie is clear magic, and the director, Ingmar Bergman, is a creator of real magic. I loved the way the music, slowly slowly just poors throughout the story. And how he explains the carachters to gently. I love this movie! It s so fasinating to see how they make swedish christmas so alive! And, Janey_Lane, you re right. If you re not over trhe record, you haven t broke it. GO GIRL!
