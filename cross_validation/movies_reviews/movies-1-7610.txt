This is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen. I read the review in my local paper. It touted this as a wonderful comedy where you'll laugh from beginning to end. It's two years later now, and I'm still waiting for my first laugh. Let me give you some honest advice, though. If you like the Coen Brothers, this is classic Coen. If you think their stuff is boring, this is the most boring of them all.
