Whoopi Goldberg can be funny at times, but she's so often in films that don't fit with her style. Sister Act was the perfect film for her, a Vegas lounge singer hiding from the mob in a convent. Predictably, she turns the lives of the nuns upside down, and they, in effect, have a big influence on her. The personalities of the show's stars--Whoopi, Harvey Keitel, Mary Wickes, Kathy Najimy, and Maggie Smith--are so winning, you overlook some of the obvious cliches.
