Wow, I didn't think this movie would be on the list. On my obscure but cool list, i had to watch that movie three times (thank God for cable TV) at age eleven before I understood what the hell was going on. John Lithgow was outstanding, especially the way he would say John Bigbooty with that crazy accent.
