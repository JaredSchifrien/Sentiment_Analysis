What an enchanting movie! Just rented it last nite and am still humming I Can't Smile without You as well as Getting to Know You. If you are a fan of Kathy Bates, you will want to hear her singing throughout this movie. The end was especially poignant and great. Julie Andrews was a scream as she constantly tried to calm people down by singing one of her big tunes. The whole cast, including Rupert Everett and Meredith Easton were fantastic. This is a must-see in my book.
