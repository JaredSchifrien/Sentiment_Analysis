Booorrrrinnnnnggggg! It's hard to make a war movie that is not at least a little exciting but they did it with this one. I know war is not all guns blazing and people being dismembered. Its a lot of sitting around sleeping, eating, checking equipment and sitting around. The said no one wants to watch a lot of the afore mentioned.
