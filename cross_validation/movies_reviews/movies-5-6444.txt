You gottal rent this and watch Joan Crawford in this truly kinky film. The Joan--Mercedes McCambridge brawl over the man is a classic. The symbolism in this flick is legion! I hadn't seen this since I was a kid and then it started appearing on cable again. I couldn't remember where I had heard the line, I never shake hands with a left-handed draw, and there it was!
