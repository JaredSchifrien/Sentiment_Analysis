A summer must-see classic! Even thoug I've seen about two-dozen times (at least) there are still scenes I love to see (the shark coming out of the water while the Sheriff tosses blood & guts overboard). This will always be a classic and even though special effects today might enhance the visuals, it would probably ruin it.
