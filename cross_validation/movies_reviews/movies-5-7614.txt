i just saw this the other night at the bidding of a friend (thanks, liz!) and i loved it. i saw some of the odyssey in it, but as i'm not a high school english teacher, i was able to enjoy it both in spite of, and because of, the mangling of homer's plot. i kinda wish they'd included the parts about calypso and circe, but oh well. i'm also not some smug suburban jerk who feels he has to run out to the local 'record town' and buy an important soundtrack right after he sees an important movie, so my opinion might actually be worth something. the movie was incredibly entertaining, and i have to say that the acting was the best that i've seen in a long while. george clooney really surprised me- i never liked him before this. even john turturro, who used to annoy me as all heroes of ifc do, was freakin amazing. so was tim blake nelson- where did that guy come from? charles durning, steven root... hell of a good cast. i never saw 'the big lebowski' - i thought the cohen brothers had gone too far with 'fargo' but this is a great, great movie. alright, the soundtrack's f'n amazing, too.
