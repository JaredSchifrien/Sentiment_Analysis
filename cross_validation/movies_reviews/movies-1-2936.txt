They could have done so much better speculating the fate of the 6 men that lost their lives in the storm that was the subject of this super charged over budget HOLLYWOOD flick. The problem is, they focused on cheesy characters and action that was an insult to the average educated human being's intelligence. It is an exciting movie for a 12 year old that likes good action flicks for the sake of action. No more, no less. The story line was so cheesy that at one point, I thought Mark Wahlberg and George Clooney were going to kiss. I may have rated it a two in that case.
