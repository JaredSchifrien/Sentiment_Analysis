One of my favorite all time movies. Many magical scenes (also many scenes that lead me to believe that Roald Dahl may have been hanging out with Lewis Carroll) I loved it as a kid, every wish fulfilled. The greedy Violet gets hers when she tries the new candy when she was told not to and turns into the huge blueberry You're turning violet, Violet. The oompa loompas, Charlie and Grandpa so mesmerized by the entire factory. And the wise old Willy Wonka.
