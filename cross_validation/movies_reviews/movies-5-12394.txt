5-star excellence, yet niche appeal only. Capote is a brilliant examination of the human psyche, in particular, Capote's, with themes of societal marginalization, narcissim, empathy, and the intersection/overlap of the same. This movie chronicles Capote's writing of a book about a Kansas quadruple murder, 'In Cold Blood,' a torturous yet sublime project that required years of emotional dedication during which Capote, something of an outsider himself, drew close to one of the 2 sociopaths and thru that relationship elicited the facts for the book. 'Capote' is not entertaining--there's no suspension of disbelief, escapist action or comedy, intellectual diversion of a whodunit, nor drama with a happy ending. But it is a display of crisp filmmaking--no extaneous story, no unnecessary dialogue, nor extra emotion, but quality writing and acting, for which lead actor Philip Seymour Hoffman rightly earned his Golden Globe. Consequently, this movie will appeal to those who admire movie crafts. Americana aficionados and writers, especially of the true crime genre, might also have special interest. And those who'd most appreciate 'Capote' might be those involved by profession or circumstance in getting info from sociopaths during years of drawn- out, emotionally toilsome legal process--such might find I-am-not-alone comfort in the movie.
