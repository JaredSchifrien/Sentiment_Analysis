Classic, classic, classic. Gene Kelly was just wonderful in this movie. Something about him in this movie is just so charasmatic and really draws you into the story of the movie. Perhaps the best scene was of Gene Kelly tapping and singing down the street in the rain. It's one of those scenes you never forget and always makes you smile. All of the dancing and singing was great, and Donald O'Connor was hilarious, as usual. The chemistry between Reynolds and Kelly was real and not forced which just made their performances that much better. But best of all, this musical actually had a plot. A real, substantial plot. From a musical, can you imagine.
