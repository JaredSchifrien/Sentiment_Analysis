 It is hard to think of one person who can't gain something from such an important movie. This movie will shock you awake. It gets you from the begining and will not let you go until you learn every harsh but well needed lesson. I just wish this was a manditory film for high school kids. I especially loved the beautiful scenes toward the end of the film that show edward nortan's character and Edward Furlong's character as little kids on the beach and how much wonder they each had for life. It makes the point that hatred is learned we are not born with it. I just hope those who see it don't take it the wrong way and think this film is glorifying hatred which to most of us it is obviouse enough stateing that hatred is ignorance. I want people to watch this film and have hope for humanity and one day we might unite.If you are in the mood for a movie that will move you and teach you in a very stern way this is highly recommended.
