this movie was heartwrenching. it made you much more aware of what jesus suffered for us. it made you aware of marys pain and as a mother watching her child suffer. that despite that he is the son of god he still was her baby. it was very moving and i applaud mel gibson for doing this movie. it was a risk im glad he took. now i understand why all those people were coming out of the theatres crying
