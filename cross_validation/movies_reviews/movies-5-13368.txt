It's always amazing to me how liberals always miss the point of this movie- even Tom Hanks disliked the character Forrest Gump. This movie is simply about your most basic Christian belief- about caring for your fellow man and doing was is good- about pursuing happiness in its rightful place. It parallels the lives of two characters Forrest and Jenny. Forrest- dumb as a bag of rocks- processes the realities of life in it's most basic forms no matter how challenging it became he always did what thought was good- what his momma told him. His journey from a crippled child to enlisting in the military and serving in Vietnam, having his best friend die in his arms is riddled with painful events that he turns into positive experiences by doing what is good. Jenny, his love, is also dealt a horrible plot in life being sexually molested as a child. Jenny is brilliant however and ends up going to Berkley living the fads of the era and embarks on a different path. She becomes consumed by fulfilling human desire that eventually consumes her and leaves her perpetually lonely. The point being made here was that human happiness is not satisfied with prurient satisfaction but action of virtue. That this appeal to universal human goods transcended human brilliance- that human happiness was part of something greater. In the end the dummy Forrest fathers a baby with Jenny that brings her only solace in life before she succumbs to AIDS. Though being the dummy the world however is Forrest's oyster where he attains an improbable wealth and happiness that he uses to continually do good. The essence of this movie is defining what is the pursuit of happiness- what is it to be free. Is happiness about satisfying simple earthly wants or is happiness about doing what is right and reaping the benefits? Liberals view the world in such a constricted box that they will consistently miss the beauty of a movie like this. But as Forrest says stupid is as stupid does.
