HERE'S JOHNNY!! Now this movie excels beyond all other horror movies. This is a classic. Jack Nicholson is a great actor who can play many different roles. He was great in this movie from start to finish. At first it seemed that he was just a typical father, yet he changed so cleverly and quickly into a raging axe murderer, trying to redrum...I mean trying to murder his wife and son. Don't mess with Jack cause all work and no play makes him a dull boy!
