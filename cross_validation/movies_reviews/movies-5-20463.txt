This is a spectacular film about the disastrous climb up Mount Everest that is also the subject of the book Into Thin Air. Seeing this film in the IMAX theater adds so much to the experience. (I also rented the film, but it just is not nearly as good on normal television.) I saw the IMAX film after reading Into Thin Air and The Climb (the latter is a book about the same expedition written by a member of one of the other groups on the mountain). The film was an excellent supplement to the books. It was particularly eerie watching climbers traverse seemingly bottomless chasms only using ladders tied together by rope. A wonderful film that is definitely worth seeing in the theaters.
