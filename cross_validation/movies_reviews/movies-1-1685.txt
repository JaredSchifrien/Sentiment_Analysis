My husband and I both thought this movie was terrible. The visuals were the only good thing. The fight sceens were to hokey with all the flying. Why did the girl take a horse when she was trying to save Chow Yun Fat if she could just fly through the tree tops? Just to silly for words and a waste of $15.50
