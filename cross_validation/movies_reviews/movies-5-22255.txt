I do love this film. The only problem I have is the script. No doubt Cameron put his hand in it big time. I really do think he should stick to teh producing and directing. To me Terminator is more a love story than anything else. The main storyline is to keep Sarah Conner alive so she conceives her son John who will help mankind to beat the Cybertech computer system. Reece gets sent back by John Conner, John knows that Reece is his dad and has to be sent back (I know, it gets complicated) Arnie was originally meant to play the part of Reece, but both himself and Cameron thought he'd be better as the Terminator. The SFX are very good considering when it was done.
