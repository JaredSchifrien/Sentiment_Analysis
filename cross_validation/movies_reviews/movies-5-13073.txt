I watched this as part of my English class during 10th grade. As I am a fanatic about world history, I thought this movie was beautifully made. Rather disturbing, since I had never seen a Holocaust movie, previous to it, that used so much detail. I'm glad that the school approved it as part of the curriculum though.
