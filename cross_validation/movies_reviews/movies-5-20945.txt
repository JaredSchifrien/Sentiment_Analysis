Funny movie. I did not want to see this when it was at the theater because i was not sure if it would be any good. I am glad I finally watched it. Rick Moranis is perfect as Seymour the nerdy flower shop worker who found a strange and unusual plant. the plant turns out to only survive on human blood. As gruesome as this sounds this is a funny movie. Steve Martin is hilarious as the nasty dentist who loves to hurt his patients. Ellen Greene is great as Audrey. I love most of the songs. this movie is set in the 1960s so a lot of the music is 60s style. the only part I do not like as much is toward the end this plant really gets nasty.
