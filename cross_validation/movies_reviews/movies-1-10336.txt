This movie is surprising bad. Jack Nickelson is a good actor, but even his acting could not save this piece of junk. Kathy Bates, a fine actress, is the only other bright spot in this otherwise dull and unwitty clunker. I did like the monolouge narration of Nickelson for his adopted son, but over-all, I was very disappointed with this movie.
