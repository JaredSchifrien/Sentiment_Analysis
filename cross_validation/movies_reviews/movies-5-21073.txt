In my opinion, the best documentary ever made, and the best filmed concert. The cinematography is first rate. The DVD contains footage not included in the original release, including a top notch performance by Janis Joplin. What sets this one above the rest is not only the performances, but the filmmaker's inclusion of interviews with artists, concertgoers, workers at the concert, the townspeople who were invaded by the event, and the people who put the concert together. It's much more than just a filmed concert. It captures a time and a society. A great historical document.
