I thought that Meet the Parents was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I didn't care about the characters at all. We never got to fully understand Ben his fiance's relationship, therefore not caring whether they got through this obstacle of meeting her parents. It wasn't funny. I was so bored and annoyed with the movie, I was actually looking away from the screen. I understand how nerve racking it is meeting significant others parents, but this was just too ridiculous. I do have a sense of humor and I do like stupid entertaining movies but this was just stupid. I thought it was horrible. The movie was so predictable so it took away from the funny parts since you knew what was coming up. I thought Ben Stiller was good. His fiance was not. Robert DeNiro used to be great, he was okay in this movie. This movie just rubbed me the wrong way and I ended up walking out with 15 minutes left. Didn't I want to see whether they get back together? Well, no. I didn't care at all. I also knew that they would since the movie was so predictable. I thought about it after I walked out to see if I was too harsh....but I really didn't like the movie.
