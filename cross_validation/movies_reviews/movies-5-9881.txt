It was soooooo funny and stupid at the same time!!! I loved it! So often I watch horror flicks and all the while thinking these people are stupid! When they should be running like crazy, they stick around to get killed but thats why its a movie and thats why I liked Scary Movie because they made fun of how horror films go. As far as everyone getting uptight about showing penises, c'mon they weren't real they were rubber or something. We see boobs and butts all the time and no one freaks out. Wayans Brothers Rule!
