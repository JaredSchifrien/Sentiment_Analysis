i just got a shirt the other day with the black knight with out any limbs and in big red letters it says " its just a flesh wound" the ppl ofmonty python are truly amazing. gods of comedy. no where else could having the big monster be defeated because the animator died of a heart attck. any wehre else and it would have failed. not monty python pulled it off, and they rock for it
