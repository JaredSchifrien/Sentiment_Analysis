Man is this good. I thought it was absolutely great, funny, feel-good, great performances from Nicholson and Hunt who both deserved their Oscars, this is one of the best films of '97 (along with L.A. Confidential and I guess Titanic), the only fault I found was I wouldn't believe that she would fall for Jack Nicholson. I loved the atmospehere of the film. Great film, see it now. Damn witty too. (Greg Kinnear was great!) Summary: ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF '97. GREAT.
