Best movie of the 1930's. Wonderful fantasy which remains fresh after seven decades. Top direction, acting, and makeup bring the bizarre characters of the Monster, the Bride, and Pretorius to life, and once seen they are never forgotten. Undergirded and given depth by touching on timeless philosophical questions--the relationship of man to Creation (and a Creator?), the purpose and moral responsibility of science, society's treatment of rejects or outsiders, and even the nature and core of religion. Yokes humor and pathos like few movies.
