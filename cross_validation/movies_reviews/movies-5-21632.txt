I thought this was a simply awesomely fantastic movie. i thouht it was exciting, scary, mysterious, romantic, thrilling, and intriguing. it made me upset at the end cause i wanted to see more and i have to wait a year for the next one to come out. i can definetly see myself buying the entire series in a few years once they have all come out on screen. i can hardly wait till the next one. my new favorite movie. will be hard to top this one
