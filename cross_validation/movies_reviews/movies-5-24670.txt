Oh yeah! Lost in Space rules! I am a huge fan of the TV show, and even though the movie is very different, it's still a lot of fun to watch. Gary Oldman was a good choice for Dr. Smith. But if there's a sequel, I hope they take out that stupid yellow creature. That was the only annoying part of the movie. Overall, it has a good cast, a pretty good story, unbelievable effects, and a ton of cool action. I'd love to see a sequel.
