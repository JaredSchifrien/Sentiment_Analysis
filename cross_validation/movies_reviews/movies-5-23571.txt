NEVER turn this over whenever it comes on (should get it on disc). Even cut up, it's better than 96% of the sickly bilge cable spews forth. So many great moments you'll lose track. Another in a long line of Kurt Russell triumphs. Not as futuristic as you'd suspect (the World Trade Center towers are still standing), but puts you in a frame of mind as to how things might come down in a worst-of-all-possible worlds. EGG ON MY FACE DEPT.: As the film was set in 1997, the Twin Towers would STILL be standing (I initially thought the film was set in the mid-2000s). Just goes to show that Carpenter's even more visionary than I gave him credit for.
