Dark, existential and very nihilistic. Ewan McGregor showing again, that he plays darker roles far better. Playing a drifter called Joe who lives on a Glasgow barge with an older couple. Joe goes nonchalantly from one inapproprate sexual relationship to another, causing emotional distress in the process. Seemingly feeling guilty and yet unable take responsibility for the behaviour his own insecurities have driven him to. This film has been dubbed 'Last Tango in Glasgow' due to its the sexual intensity, which is usually barely simmering below the surface. Like Last Tango in Paris, the film depends very heavily on sexual chemistry, although by comparison the latter is more tender. The custard scene from Young Adam has acquired a certain kudos all of it's own and rightly so. It's very reminiscent (without being too explicit) of a certain scene in Last Tango. After watching it I was asking myself the question was she consenting or not? Although this in some way defines the film in that these women never reject Joe, showing an emotional weakness on thier part too. Overall, a challenging film which gives you plenty to think about both morally and emotionally, but probably not a good film to watch if you've just been dumped or were looking for a feel good movie!
