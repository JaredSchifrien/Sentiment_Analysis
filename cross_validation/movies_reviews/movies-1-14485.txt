bad movie. Honestly the only person in this film,no,movie who was believable or likable for that matter was Francis Mcdormand.What do you expect?She steals every movie shes in. Not for one second did i believethese guys were rock stars.this is an extrememly watered down pasturized version of rock and roll so it can reach a broader audience and not offend anyone. there is nothing rock and roll about this film. You do hear Elton John,but we all know that doesnt count.i changed my rating from a two to a one because the hype for this terrible movie makes me ILL.
