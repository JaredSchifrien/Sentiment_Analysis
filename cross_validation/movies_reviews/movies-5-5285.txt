Still as great as it was so many years ago. Magical, brilliant, frightening, essential, are just some of the words that could describe this great film. It has inspired so much, and those winged monkeys, the way the witch melts, the black-and-white beginning, it's timeless. Summary: A TIMELESS, ESSENTIAL, BRILLIANT, FRIGHTENING FILM.
