Clerks is the first of four Kevin Smith films. It shows a day in the life of the avereage american worker. Dante and Randal are just two guys trying to make a living. The perfect blend of realism and comedy. And the best comic duo I've ever seen in my life: Jay and Silent Bob. Jay: the epitimy of white trash. And Silent Bob: a genious, a master of many things, and one of the only people who can stand Jay for extended periods of time. But let's not forget Kevin Smith's great way of blending the other films together. Rick Derris, the body building moron, and Walt Flanagan, the pissed off customer are mentioned in the second film Mallrats . I love this movie. I recommed this for anyone who loves comedy at its best.
