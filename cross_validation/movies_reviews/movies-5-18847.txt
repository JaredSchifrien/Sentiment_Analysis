A classic for any horror buff. The effects were nice , the story line is nice also. The actors were pretty good too. 2 boys take a trip to england, they are on the outskirts of town, in the middle of nowhere, they see a pub and go in, inside they asked what the star on the wall was, and the People at the pub they went ape $hit after that and sent them out, and one of the boys David gets attacked by a warewolf and turns into a warewolf on the next full moon, and the other boy Jack gets killed, David then see's Jack later and he is of the undead until David is killed and the warewolf line is severed. Watch it, good movie
