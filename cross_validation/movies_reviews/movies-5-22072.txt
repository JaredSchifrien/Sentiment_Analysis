Every time I watch this movie I see some thing new. Keanu, who is not my favortie actor, does a good job in this. He will always be Theodore Logan to me. The rest of the cast is excellent and the effects are spectacular. If you have been living in a cave you have to see this movie it is awesome. Looking forward to the sequals. Update: Well the sequals were a bit of a bust but the original still holds up.
