The Shining (1980) is simply one of the greatest horror movies. Kubrick did a phenomenal job at creating a very frightening movie. I don't care what King says -- this movie is fantastic. The camera angles were very spooky... and of course Jack Nicholson. Great dialogue with the ghost bartender. Lots of moments that will make your hairs stand... Come play with us Danny!
