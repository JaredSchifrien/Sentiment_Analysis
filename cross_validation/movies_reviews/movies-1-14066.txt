The fact that Ron Howard directed this may attract viewers, but it will only leave them cuonfused and bored out of their minds. Apollo 13 is the story of 3 astronauts whpo go into outer space, but their spaceship breaks down and leaves them out there, stranded without their families. I was extremly disappointed and you will be too.
