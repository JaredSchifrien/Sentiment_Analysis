Wow, what can I say! John Woo is truly made for directing action movies, especially shoot-em-up flicks. With the addition of Nicholas Cage and John Travolta, i'm simply speechless. Story was fresh for a change, acting was way up there, poetic shootouts were jaw-dropping. But I think the best John Woo film has to be Hard Boiled, the best action movie i've witnessed first hand, it makes Face/Off look like a kid's movie. But anything by John Woo will do.
