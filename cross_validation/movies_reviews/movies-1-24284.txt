This movie was lame. The whole train station scene was retarded. The french guy got punked out way to easy. Neo fights like a sissy in the real world. Then we're forced to watch morphus and the crew fly a ship for 2 hrs as the lamer characters defend club zion. The final fight was a Dragon Ball Z rip off and the ending sucked big time. They didn't even explain anything it just ended with the old bag and the architect (aka Colonel Sanders) talking at the park. WTF? O yeah Trinity dies and so does Neo. How do you like them apples?
