The best of the Star Wars prequels. Hayden Christensen did great as Anakin who turned evil, killed Jedi Knights, and, after a great lightsaber duel with Obi-Wan Kenobi on mustafar's lava fields, became the evil Darth Vader. Many great battles, special effects, and sad scenes, especially the Jedi Knights being killed by clone troopers and padme dying after she gave birth to Luke and Leia. palpatine transforming into the Emperor was also cool as well as General Grievous.
