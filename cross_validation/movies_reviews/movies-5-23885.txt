Simply put, an AMAZING movie, probably one of the best sci-fi film, hell BEST film of the last decade. It gives a shocking and very plausible look at the not too distant future where people can genetically engineer their own children. Vincent, played by a very capable Ethan Hawke, is one of those who are not genetically engineered. He was born out of love, without the tinkering of scientists and their genetic manipulation. Not trying to quickly summarize the movie in a sentence or two (simply because you can't since the movie's that powerful)...but basically the rest of the movie is about his pursuit of his dream of becoming an astronaut at the space corporation Gattaca. The movie, while a bit slow at places, is an emotional and incredible ride that shows us the meaning of what it is to be human and that we can all achieve what we aspire. The music, composed by Michael Nyman is one of those musical scores that can stand on its own without the movie, though it definitely enhances the already great writing and strong performances by Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman among others. This is one of those movies have had profound impact on me. If you haven't seen it, you should go out and rent it immediately. Hell, even if you have seen it, you should go out and rent it immediately as well! You will not be disappointed.
