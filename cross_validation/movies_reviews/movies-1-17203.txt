Hopeless! This movie you would think is going to be great because of Harrison Ford, but it is a shocker that just drags on and on. I walked out of this movie, and i've never walked out of a movie in my life. It has a good idea, but it doesn't reach a climax or leave you on the edge of your seat. A hopeless, slow movie that isn't worth watching even if someone paid you. Avoid at all costs!!
