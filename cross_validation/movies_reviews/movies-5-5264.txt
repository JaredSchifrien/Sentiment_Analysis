One of the best movies ever made and it is one of the great family movies to watch. When I was a kid, I had always anticipated the event during Thanksgiving time when I always knew that is time for THE WIZARD OF OZ. The story is absoultely beautiful and that the talent of Judy Garland was surpreme. The singing, the story, the acting and costumes were a sight to see. I was just overjoyed by it all. It was very creative to start in black&white then to go to color and then to end with black&white. Each charceter was very intersting, The Scarecrow, The Tin Man and The Lion were amazing especially when they were all together. My favorite line is when the witch is melting aways, How can a beautiful girl like destroy my wickedness! What a line! What a great movie!
