I don't know what some of these reviewers are complaining about. I consider myself a discerning movie watcher, and must say that Titan A.E. is nearly as epic a space opera as Star Wars itself. Seriously! This movie has it all--amazing visuals, great story and voice talents, and an awesome soundtrack to boot!
