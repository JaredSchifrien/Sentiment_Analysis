Despite the film's complimentary reviews and it's growing legion of fans, it is terrible. A special effects extravaganza and not much more. A somewhat confusing plot, and long periods of unexciting storyline don't help this movie live up to it's comic book beginnings. Maybe it can all be summed up in two words: Keanu Reeves.
