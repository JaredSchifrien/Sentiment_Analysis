awesome, awesome, awesome action. not as fast-paced as 'resident evil' but all around a much better movie. scariest, ickiest vampires since 'salem's lot.' nice to see horror/action movies getting back to basics. the cgi blade in the battles was totally believable. the new 'reaper' vampires themselves were excellent, crawled like insects, swarmed like serpents. i never rated the first film, if i had i would have given it four, or possibly five stars, the deduction possibly because the movie was essentially just a comic book, but this new one has extra dimensions, and a smoother plot. it also doesn't resort at any point to i did your mom, which is probably a good thing. better action here, too, worth the wait, and not a disappointment.
