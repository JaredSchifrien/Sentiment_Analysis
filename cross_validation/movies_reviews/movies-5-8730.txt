I did not want to see this when it came out in the states over the summer, but ended up seeing it in Dublin when I was over there in the fall. I haven't been to a comedy in the cinema in a long tiem where everyone laughed so loudly as they did there. I had such a good time seeing it. It just kept getting funnier and funnier. It doesn't really stand a second watching, though.
