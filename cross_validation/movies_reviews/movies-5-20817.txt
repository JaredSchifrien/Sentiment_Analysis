I tend to get annoyed by musicals - but I really liked Chicago. ALL of the characters are twisted and conniving.... and interesting. The songs are dark and sarcastic - and unlike most musicals - actually seem like a logical extension of the character's mindset. From Richard Gere's money hungry lawyer character, he does it for the love, to Catherine-Zeta Jones' act of desperation when she feels her star falling, to Queen Latifah's mama will take care of you, each of the musical bits is brilliant. I was shocked at how much I enjoyed this movie. Those who have held off seeing it because they expect the campiness of moulin rouge or sound of music should really give chicago a shot - it's a weird, fun flick.
