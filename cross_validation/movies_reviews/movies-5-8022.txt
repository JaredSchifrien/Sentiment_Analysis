One of the five funniest movies of all time, due in some part to great writing but mostly due to the fact that Bill Murray is hilarious. Put anyone else in that role and you have a movie that's barely above average. Who else could have pulled off that Old Yeller speech at the end of basic training? But the best scene in the movie has to be when Sgt. Hulka has them go around and introduce themselves... There was one?
