An R-rated movie that is shockingly marketed toward teenagers, this one promotes sexuality as freedom, like too many trashy teen movies of our time. It includes not just premarital sex, but drug use, violence and nudity. The creators and actors in this film note that they had to find a non-obnoxious way to make a modern teen a virgin. That's right, my friends, being pure is obnoxious and unpopular. (I've never heard anything more ridcioulous!) Thankfully, the film didn't gross much, but several teenagers I know wanted to watch it at school. This film certainly has cruel intentions, to corrupt the teenagers of our time. Avoid at all costs.
