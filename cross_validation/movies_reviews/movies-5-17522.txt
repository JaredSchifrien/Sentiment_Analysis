Outstanding. This movie was much more powerful for me than either Platoon or Saving Private Ryan. It is the story of a couple of Australian sprinters who are sent to the unwinnable battle of Gallipoli. There are some really chilling scenes of how men act when they know they are facing certain death. Do not rent this if you are looking for an uplifting movie.
