Life is Beautiful is a very well done film and deals with the very difficult topic of Hitler's genocide attempt upon the Jews. It was made with wisdom. It portrayed believable characters and effectively showed the love of a father for his son. I am amazed at how well this was done with the juxtapostition of being humorous in the darkest of situations. A great movie that touches the heart!
