Definitely one of my top 10. Even though I dont care for Tim Robbins' politics, his portrayal of Andy was superb. At first I had a hard time accepting him in that role (in Steven Kings short story, Andy is small in stature, not tall like Robbins). Morgan Freeman was even better. Freeman is a one of the greatest actors ever and this is one of his best pictures. I have the DVD and find myself watching it a couple of times a year just for inspiration.
