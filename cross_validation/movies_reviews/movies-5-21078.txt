Excellent movie that even has a good story line. it takes place in the early 1900s. A jewish farmer is reluctant to change his traditions in a changing world. Where it is tradition for matchmakers, to find husbands for daughters, tyeve{SP} daughters want to marry the men they love.the papa has to decide it he should stick with traditon or think about his daughters happiness. there are some wonderful songs, If I were a Rich man, Matchmaker, sunrise, sunset,very well acted,. the only criticism I would have is it is a bit too long.
