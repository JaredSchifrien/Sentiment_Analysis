I had been wanting to see this film since the previews started four years or so ago (Slight exageration) and by goly if I wasn't disapointed as a small child who receives a Kid Rock C.D. for Christmas. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME. I don't give a damn about a stupid love story! That isn't what Pearl Harbor was about! I care about the history not the stupid friggin love triangle thing! If I wanted that mellow Drama BULL Sh*t I would have gone and seen HERE ON EARTH or some other teeny bopper crap movie with a love triangle in it. Stupid side plots like that have no porpous in what could have been a very fine war drama about America and one of its greatest loses and most horrible disasters. This film should have been titled Pearl Harbor's All That or Sleepless in Pearl Harbor. This movie is a travesty and I am ashamed for ever going to see this peice of trash. What complete poo.
