I'm not really the type to like musicals, but I really enjoyed this movie and thought it was one of the best I'd seen in a long time. There was a lot more singing and dancing in the movie than I expected, but it surprisingly wasn't a bad thing. It always kept me entertained and I thought the costumes and settings were great visuals.
