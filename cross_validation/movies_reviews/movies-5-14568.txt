Cast Away still has me thinking about what life would be like living on a deserted island for 4 years with practically nothing. Tom Hanks did a spectacular job in this role. The movie was very realistic both in the beginning, middle, and end. I know many people didn't like the end, I thought it made the movie even better cause lets face it, not everything has a good ending and it made it realistic. The special effects were good and I liked how the dialog was minimal as well as the musical score. This movie was wonderful
