As a bonafide Brazil-phile, I must admit my bias here. Regardless I found this to be the best Brazilian film since Amor Bandido (1979). The relationship between the child and adult woman who finds him living in the train station is engrossing. What I liked most about this film however was it's sheer believeability - sadly the phenomenon of street kids does exists there, thus, there's a subtle dose of social commentary mixed in with a gripping storyline. Recommended.
