This is one of those movies that when you are leaving the theatre you hope your not reckognized. This movie sucked! I have been a dog owner and I like dogs. But sitting down and watching a bunch of eccentric freaks parade their dogs made me sick. This was not a comedy it was a tragedy. This group of dogs gets treated better than most humans.
