This is a hoot--puncturing the righteous folk music fad. I suppose most of you don't remember the folk music craze of the 1950's and 1960's. Lucky you! Lots of scrubbed up and later scruffy music cranks strummed and hummed and bummed their way around the country warbling about oppression and recession and depression and regression and obsession, ad naseum. This movie skewers the Kingston Trio, Ian and Sylvian and others. It is great fun. (I have an admission to make. I rather liked the folk era!)
