Surely the best movie of the wild bunch called Monthy Python. Not as simple as most of their movies (wich I love too) but much more complex and intelligent. Incredible imagination and visual invention (I love most of Terry Gilliam s movies) mixed with great performances in a real master piece that you won t be able to forget in your entire life.
