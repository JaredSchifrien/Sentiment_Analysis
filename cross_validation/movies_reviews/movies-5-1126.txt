The movie Scarface is one of my all time favorite movies. It has a little bit of everything within the movie such as romance, friendship, suspense, and especially violence. I really enjoy violent movies and Scarface fits that criteria. Scarface shows how drugs and drug dealing are a major part of american culture.
