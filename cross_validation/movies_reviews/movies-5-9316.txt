Probably Spielberg's best film, this one is overlooked at times, even though it was groundbreaking. The use of live actors with animated characters had never been done in an entire feature length film to my knowledge. The characters are fun and funny at the same time, and the voice-overs are brilliant. Unlike a lot of Spielberg's films, there is actually a plot to this one. Someone is trying to destroy toontown.
