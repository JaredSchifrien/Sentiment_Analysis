How can anyone give this piece of crap more than one star. This movie is terrible, we're talking Plan Nine from Outerspace terrible. I admire Travolta's misguided efforts to bring one of the works of his demigogue to life. However, this book is a bad book, and bad books only make bad movies. I can only assume that all of the actors with any name recognition were followers of Scientology, and that is the only reason why this film was not locked into a vault. The unbelievable nature of the film cannot be denied. No one beyond the age of four could possibly be held in disbelief for one simple reason: gold is not the most presious metal on the planet, let alone the universe. The plot and reality mistakes just get worse as the movie goes on. Do not consider this movie unde any circumstances.
