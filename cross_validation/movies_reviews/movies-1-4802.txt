Now, this is the type of film that caused Disney and I to part company until they redeemed themselves with the likes of The Lion King . I might have stayed loyal longer had they not insulted my intelligence with this kind of simplistic tripe. The Love Bug was one of several Disney films that came across as very one-dimensional, lacked wit, flare and was just silly. I know it was a big hit in its day but, in my case anyway, it just joined the ranks of the quickly produced, lame-o post-Walt stuff you too often found occasionally being churned out by Disney apparently for no other reason than to make a quick buck. And, with their moola, history and resources they had no real excuse for this kind of thing.
