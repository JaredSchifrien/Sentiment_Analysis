Amazing, epic movie. I won't recant all the qualities it possesses, other posts have done a good enough job as it is. One thing I specifically liked was the display style of retribution. No supreme concepts such as forgiveness over revenge, or the 'revenge won't bring back the dead' theme of most modern movies. No long speeches before Wallace expresses his revenge, just simple, satisifying revenge. Not that I disagree with the aforementioned concepts and themes expressed in modern movies, just in their appliance to movies of past eras.
