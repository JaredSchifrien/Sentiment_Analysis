A very entertaining and incredibly voilent police thriller movie starring the immortal Chow Yun Fat and made by the equally brilliant John Woo. The film was made in 1992. The plot revolves around Inspector Yuen (Chow Yun Fat) and his undercover buddy/rival Tony (Tony Leung) trying to bust some Hong Kong arms smugglers. The first scene in the movie is classic, chicken cages everywhere and THAT jumping bit with the dual sub-machine guns. Another great scene is when Yuen freestyle raps to a baby he's carrying to keep him entertained while he fights off ever more gun-toting gangsters. This is typical John Woo fare, simplistic (yet poignant, the little paper boats metaphor to life was pretty interesting, I thought) characters and bucketloads of voilence.
