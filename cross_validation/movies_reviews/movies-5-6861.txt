One of my favorite movies. It's sooo silly, but at the same time, it's very intelligent. The Monty Python boys really knew their stuff when they recreated the medieval time. I really like the peasants talking about the government ( You're not my king, I didn't vote for you ) Monty Python is one of those things you really like or really hate. It's hard to be neutral about it.
