Overrated stinkorama. Some of the bad SCI-FI movies Mystery Science Theater 3000 makes fun of was better than this snorefest. Supposedly, the entire scenery and background was computer animated. If that's the case, then I was praying for the Blue Screen of Death to pop up and get me out of this. So utterly boring, the drab background was dull and unimaginative. Even the Fx stunk. The planes looked plain dumb. The story was like some 9th rate film noir by some rookie hack. Absolutely zero chemistry between Jude Law and Apple's mom. I used to like Jude Law (especially in Talented Mister Ripley), but his string of stinkers (Alfie, Closer, and this detritus) makes him the latest actor to go shark jumping. We may only remember him as the dude who stood next to Ashlee Simpson when she complained about acid reflux on SNL.
