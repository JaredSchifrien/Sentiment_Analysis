Wow. This film was amazing, a true masterpiece. This movie really shows how drugs will destroy your life. The unique way the movie was filmed is what makes it so great, from each character's point of view. Yes, the ending is devastating, but what do you expect. Drug addiction usually doesn't lead to a happy ending. Even if you don't like sad movies, this movie will fascinate you and hold your full attention until the horrifying ending. This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen..
