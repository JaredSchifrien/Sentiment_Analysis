this is a perfect film, in the director's cut, and still worth 5 stars otherwise. its power lies in its raw humanity, like book asking what it is that makes someone human. can an android, sentenced to death for mass murder, for instance, unable to feel any emotions of its own, commit an act which denoted empathy for another living being? how do you ecxplain it if it does? this movie indicts science with ignorance of what it creates, or tries to imitate, exposing the arrogance and overconfidence of those responsible for bringing the replicants into being and attempting to control the lives it created. the same system needs a man like deckerd to hunt down the androids when their time is up, and the monsters have outgrown their creators. yet how is a man like him supposed to justify his work, which never involves anything but murder. how does such a man fall in love with one such android? these are some of the questions this movie evokes, and which make it not only a visual masterpiece, but one of the greatest single uses of the science fiction medium in film.
