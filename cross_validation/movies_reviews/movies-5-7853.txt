I think that this is a great movie with Jack Nicholson playing Melvin who is a nasty man who has a neighbor who is gay. Helen Hunt plays a waitress who has a sick son. Melvins neighbor gets put in the hospital because he got beat up bad so Melvin has to watch after Verdel {neighbors dog} and Melvin slowly starts to change his life around to a nicer man because of watching this dog.
