I was reading an ad in the paper and it said that you will be looking for the exit at the 5 min mark and thats exactly what I did. The movie was very well made,shot,and acted.The disturbing factor of this movie was through the roof.Many unexpected events and happenings in this movie to keep you on edge at all times.If you want to see somthing push the boundaries of movie making go see it.
