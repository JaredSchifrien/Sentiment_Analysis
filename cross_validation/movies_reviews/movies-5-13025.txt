This is one of the greatest films EVER MADE. Such raw brilliance, such magnificent acting, wonderful story, script, direction from Coppola, this IS the movie to watch. And they did it again with The Godfather Part II! Anybody who gave this anything other than 5 stars (maybe 4 stars is OK), cannot call themselves fans of movies. The music is the best I've ever heard in a movie. Wow! WOW! This film is so damn good! Al Pacino's Michael Corleone and Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone performances are the stuff of legends. Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton are brilliant as well. See this movie. Don't walk...but RUN down to the video store. I cannot recommend it enough. Summary: ONE OF THE TOP 5 GREATEST MOVIES EVER MADE.
