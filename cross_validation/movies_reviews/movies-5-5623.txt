One of my very favorite Hitchcocks. Metaphorically, it is about the dangers of peering too closely into the dark spaces in others, or indeed into ourselves. Stifling: between the small room, the feeling of being crippled, and the awful muggy summer heat, it makes you sweat like the protagonist, and the buildup to the climax is amazing.
