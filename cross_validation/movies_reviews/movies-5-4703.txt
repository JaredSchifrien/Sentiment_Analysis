OMG how can u call it a children's bore ?! It waz an awesome movie and the actorz and actressez rocked! Of course, the best waz KHLEO THOMAS!! :-) And I mean even though Khleo (Khaleed Leon) Thomas improved the movie a LOT (he'z so hott and such a great actor!), it would have been great even without him! The plot is really exciting and it'z amazing how it all tiez together. It had an advantage because the author of the original book (which waz great, too) wrote the screenplay. All in all, the acting waz awesome and the movie waz well written!
