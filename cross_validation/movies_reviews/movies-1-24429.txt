This movie cannot be helped. The thin plot and poorly crafted sets are only the beginning. Gary Busey doesn't portray someone with any depth, and while Russel tries to properly portray his character, the supporting roles and his scenes are without merit. The story is undeveloped, as are the characters, and the plot goes nowhere. This film's special effects are definitly below average, and the film's low budget shows through in every scene. I would ask Kurt Russell if he read the script before making this, or if they just through a good heap of money at him. This is even beneath his abilities as an actor.
