An interesting mix of Sci-fi and horror. Normally I would bash it because in truth it is more sci-fi than horror, but I just loved the movie. Out of control scientists, mutant telepaths and telekinetics. Very cool. And yes, as the two reviews below mention.... GORE! and exploding heads for the young and idiotic who believe that is what horror should be.
