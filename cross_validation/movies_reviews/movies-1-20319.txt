Unquestionably the worst sequel out of the entire series (with the possible exception of Jason X). The acting was horrible, the plot was idiotic, and the music was stupid. This movie really had some potential as I was happy to see it take place somewhere other than the camp itself, and the beginning was OK, but the end was so stupid it makes me wonder how the filmmakers could ever live with themselves.
