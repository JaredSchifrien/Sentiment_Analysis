Excellent movie. The only time it falters is the overly long explanation scene at the end with the psychiatrist. Anthony Perkins is suitably creepy as Norman Bates. There are several outstanding scenes including those with Mother, the parlor scene with Marion and Norman, Lila looking for Mother, etc. Janet Leigh is sexy and very sympathetic. I remember seeing Psycho for the first time on TV when I was about 13. I was totally shocked when the movie takes a complete u-turn. I had no idea what was in store, so I was stunned. Nowadays, the whole plot is given away by reviewers and descriptions on dvd or video cases. This is a shame - It has much more of an impact if you don't know anything about the plot. The acting, editing, writing, directing and cinematography are all first-rate. However, the music score by Bernard Herrmann deserves a special mention. This odd score with shrieking violins drives the film and keeps the viewer interested. It also provides an ominous tension throughout the film. One of the most memorable films ever and the best by Hitchcock!
