I was impressed at how faithful the movie was to the book. I noticed that some parts of the book were left out only to learn that they were left on the editing room floor. After giving it a second thought I realized that it was better this way. Seeing how idiots like axlrod2003 can't stay focused for two seconds. If people lke him were forced to endure the extra footage it would surely drive them to suicide.
