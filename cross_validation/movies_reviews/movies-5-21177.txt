 Hair is one of my favorite movies. This is possibly because I wish that (or I used to...) I lived in the 60's. The music is great, the acting is great. If you like trip interludes this has 2...I think. They get stoned and then later drop acid. And that is fun to watch. I'm not going to give away the ending, but I will say it's a good one.
