Why this classic is not in the Top Five I cannot imagine. All 3 stars should have won Oscars that year. Incredible that MacMurray and Robinson were not even nominated, and that was the year that Bing Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald won!! Another miscarriage of justice was Barbara Stanwyck losing to the grossly overrated Bergman.
