A fantastic film directed by Terry Gillam. The plot is rather simple, but the workings behind it make it complex as it comprises of time travel. Its quite a dark movie but it isn't depressing, I found it rather moving. The main character is James Cole played by Bruce Willis who is sent back to the past to observe and pick up clues to find out why most of the human race is wiped out and the rest have to flee underground. He ends up in a mental institute where he meets up with Brad Pitts character (brilliantly performed and shows that the man IS intelligent) and gets a psychiastrist (Madeleine Stowe) to helpl him out. This film shows how humans assume and don't open up their minds to other concepts. But on a simple level, it is a love story. The music is good as well. A film definately worth watching.
