A fantastic movie. I always love Bogey, but even Hepburn is great in this one (she's great, but not one of my faves). Reminds me of Swept Away... a bit (the Italian classic, not the dumb Madonna crap). There's adventure, comedy, etc., but there's an undercurrent of sexual tension in it - note the metaphors, her having an orgasm going down the rapids, and them getting it on by the middle, when they've fallen in love. Every romance adventure movie since, like Romancing the Stone, uses the same plot devices, character development, etc. Despite all that, you really see first rate acting. These 2 shouldn't work together, but they do. I almost wanted to do Hepburn! Made me rethink the idea of missionary work.
