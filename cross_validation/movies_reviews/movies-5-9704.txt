 A Mighty Wind may not be as good as Best In Show or Waiting For Guffman , but it still gets my ***** rating. A Mighty Wind tells the story of a group of 60's folk singers who are about to reunite. Some have been more successful than others, but the ones that have been successful have certainly not been with their music. The characters are wonderful, the actors are amazing. Eugene Levy is oscar-worthy, as are Catherine O'Hara and Parker Posey. You must see this film!
