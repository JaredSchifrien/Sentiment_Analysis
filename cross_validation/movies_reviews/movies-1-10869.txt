A totally unappealing, rotten comedy that lacks heart--and mind. The isolated moments of wit (Such as the "When In Rome..." confusion) are drowned-out in the all-too-typical stupidity associated with most SNL alums. The raunch factor is quite high for a PG-13 movie (including one particular sight gag that was completely unfunny) and there is not a single likable character in the entire movie. It competely lost me when the kicked the dog off of the bridge. Mean-spirited, uncreative, and mindless--Anchorman needs to be cancelled from the realm of cinema altogether.
