This movie was a fantastic adaptation of Edith Wharton's novel. House of Mirth skillfully portrays a young woman in late 19th century New York society who makes a few dumb mistakes, and is harshly punished for them. Gillian Anderson and Eric Stoltz were marvelous in the leading roles, and should have been at least been nominated for Oscars. But if you're looking for a movie that will make you feel good movie don't rent this one. House of Mirth will break your heart.
