Unlike the novel by Bret Easton Ellis, which is one of the best pieces of literature ever written by man, this movie was so horrible. I know this movie was not meant to have deep meaning to it, but it could have been close to the book, which it obviously was not. Any true Bret Easton fan could tell you this. I don't think any of his books have been made into great movies to date, except for maybe Less Than Zero. I do not recommend this waste of space to anyone. :(
