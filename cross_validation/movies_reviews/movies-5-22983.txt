Not a film to suit all tastes.Many (understandably)found it confusing and pretentious,and had difficulty identifying with the cast-its robot HAL does seem the most human character,while the dialogue is hardly exciting.Yet it is,i think,the most awe-inspiring English-language achievement in all of cinema.I will never forget the effect the first viewing had on me.It is monumental in its concept,scope and ambition,an unsurpassed visual experience- which is,surely,the essence of Film.The special effects are superlative(this was back in 1968!)and hugely influential,the set design staggering,the use of music inspired,the stargate sequence a dazzling trip to a wondrous new destiny.And there's the most famous,audacious single cut in film history.More appreciated outside America -it was the only film from the previous 30 years to make the top 10 in Sight and Sound's last major international poll,and has featured ever more strongly in others- it reaches for the stars,and continues to expand.See it on the big screen and be amazed.
