I was stunned to see this movie was not listed in the classics section when I first started using rateitall. No list of movie classics is complete without including this marvelous film. George C Scott gives a virtuoso performance. His skill and depth in this role is equalled by very few in movie history. I cannot say enough about how great the acting was in this movie from top to bottom. I believe this is one the greatest films ever made! The acting alone should garner it a 4 from every rater. Action, drama, humor, sadness... this movie had it all. From the opening sequence with him standing in front of the red, white, and blue to the glorious final scenes. A masterpiece of acting and filmmaking. Scotts portrayal of Patton is certainly studied in many schools of the arts not only for his acting but for its history. They just don't make movies like this very often and in modern times it is even rarer to see a movie of equal quality.
