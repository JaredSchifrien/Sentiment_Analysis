Experience Charleston Heston at his greatest when he utters the words, leave him alone, you damn dirty ape! Better than Ben-Hur, Heston plays a marooned space captin confused about what planet he has landed on. The question is not where, but when. And with the creepy twilight zone ending, this movie rates 5 bananas!
