I did not have any expectations when I went to the theatres to watch that movie. But I was pleasently surprised. Will Smith was very funny and so were all the other actors. The story was not crazy unique but it made me laugh a lot. It is not that kind of movie you will remember for a long time. It was great entertainment and that is what I was looking for.
