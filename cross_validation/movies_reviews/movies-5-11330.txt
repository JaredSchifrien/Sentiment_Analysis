This is among my favorite movies of all time. It has a ton of quotable lines, and is maybe the only Tim Burton movie where there's a personality at its center that overshadows the odd universe created by the director. Pee Wee (There's things about me you wouldn't understand... things you couldn't understand... things you shouldn't understand) is at his best in this movie. Francis, Dottie, Speck, Amazing Larry, they all rule. (BTW, the biggest laugh I ever got out of a Mystery Science Theater episode came recently when someone quoted Pee Wee using that deep voice, Paging Mr. Herman, from the movie-within-the-movie near its end.)
