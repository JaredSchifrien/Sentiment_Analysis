This is a funny film! The animation is perfectly melded with the live-action actors. The jokes are great and come in all forms--movie references, classic Looney Tunes jokes, slapstick, and even great moments that break the fourth wall! Steve Martin is particularly notable as the head of Acme. Starting with a bang, and never slowing down, this movie is simply great fun!
