I like Jackie Chan movies. He makes some of the better martial arts movies out there. I loved the Las Vegas connection. The scene with the gay (whassa the word for high class clothing salesmen? - yeah thats the one) guys trying to get those two suited up properly was a scream! My wife lived in Las Vegas for years and caught all the 'local humor'- there are some levels of humor in this film that if you are in the know, are a scream! And, like all of Jackie's movies I think the outtakes alone are worth the price of admission! So Do my wife, so do our teen aged kids.
