I think this is the best movie I've seen in a long time. One thing that bothered me was how they spoke Mandarin in Hong Kong. Being Chinese, I know Hong Kong's main language is Cantonese. Other than that, I liked everything about it, especially the fighting scene between Jet Li and Russel Wong. I also liked how they were able to add special effects when illustrationg the point at where the enemy dies and their bones break.
