Something that has ticked me off since Oscar nigth though is that all I hear is that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has the record for most wins for a foreign language film. WRONG!!! Fanny and Alexander also won four Oscars. And since Crouching tiger... didn't win five their 'record' doesn't exist. Fanny and Alexander still hold the record and that's that.
