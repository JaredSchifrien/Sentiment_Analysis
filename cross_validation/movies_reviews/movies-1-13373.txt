Forrest Gump is, without a shadow of a doubt, the worst film I have ever had the sad misfortune of viewing. This celebration of gross stupidity is crass, completely lacking in any genuine wit and moves at a sloth-like pace from ridiculously contrived plotline to another. Tom Hanks, a leviathan of modern film-making, is as sickly and lacking in charisma as ever. I would sooner watch my Grandmother being savaged by rabid Tigers than view this piece of rubbish again.
