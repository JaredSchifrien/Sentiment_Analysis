Excellent animation, Hillarous plot with funfilled unforgettable characters that will have children constantly beginning their parents to buy this movie on DVD. The SLOTH had me ROTFLMAO(figuratively speaking)for talking and becoming an annoyance. THe Sabertooth cat was a sly and meticulous character that makes me wanna SHOUT! This movie reminded me of Three men and a Baby. I am glad that both animals put aside the laws of nature by forming a symbiosis relationship anb becoming friends. Recommended for all ages!
