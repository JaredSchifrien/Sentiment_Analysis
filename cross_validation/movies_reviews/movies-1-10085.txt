The image of Andy Kaufman as a nice, funny guy is shattered by reality. He is a mean, twisted, manipulative individual. The movie is marketed like it is a comedy and this is far from the truth. The reality of Andy Kaufman's life was not all fun and games and this movie is his life story, but it is sold (like Kaufman) to the public as something it is not.
