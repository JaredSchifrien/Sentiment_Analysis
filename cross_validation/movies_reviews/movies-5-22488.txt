Isn't Blade Runner the most voted movie in this rating?? I have mercy of you, American guys. The most perfect movie of the history of cinema, with most perfect soundtrack, the most perfect performances, the most perfect setting, the most perfect screenplay, the most perfect scenery and I could go on.... The definite movie.
