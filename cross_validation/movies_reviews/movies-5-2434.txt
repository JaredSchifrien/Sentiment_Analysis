At the movie theater-restaurant that I work part-time, Collateral had an impressive seven-week run whereas most films last only two or three and are quickly replaced by newer movies (we have a limited number of theaters and can only accomodate the most profitable, mainstream films). I ended up seeing it three times -- some of the dialogue still gives me chills. Everything about Collateral is superbly done, especially the acting performances of Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. This ranks as one of my favorite movies, and I would recommend it to anybody who's looking for an action thriller with brains.
