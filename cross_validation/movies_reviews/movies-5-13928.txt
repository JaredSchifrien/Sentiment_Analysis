This fast-paced movie kept my attention from start to finish. It tells the story of two Marines accused of killing a fellow soldier and the investigation that follows. With a gripping plot and excellent acting across the board (Tom Cruise, Demi Moore and Jack Nicholson star), A Few Good Men is a winner. My favorite scene is with Jack Nicholson in the courtroom. YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!
