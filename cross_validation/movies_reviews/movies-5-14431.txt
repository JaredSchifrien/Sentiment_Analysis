Predictably when you consider the subject matter, Hotel Rwanda is not a particularly uplifting movie. But it is an excellent one. Without giving anything away, Hotel Rwanda is the true story of a Hutu hotel manager of a four star hotel in Kigali who converted the hotel at which he worked into a refugee camp for Hutus and Tutsis during the 1994 massacre (mostly by machete) that slaughtered about 1M civilians. It's an extremely educational film - for example, I didn't know that the Hutu and Tutu designation had been arbitrarily assigned by the Belgian colonialists based on completely subjective physical attributes (e.g. you're pretty tall, you shall be a tutsi). The movie does a really good job of showing that Kigali is a civilized, modern city - and the massacre that took place was not between two bloodthirsty tribes in the desert somewhere. But most of all, Hotel Rwanda illustrates with chilling, powerful simplicity what can happen with out of control partisanship, combined with hate radio, combined with animosity. My wife cried pretty much entirely through this movie, and parts of it are hard to handle. But it's worth seeing, if nothing else for the education, and to see the brilliant performance of Don Cheadle.
