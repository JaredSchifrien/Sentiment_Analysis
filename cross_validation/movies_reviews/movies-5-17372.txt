Eisenstein's legendary silent milestone- possibly the single most important and influential film in the development of cinema as an art form.Depicting the 1905 mutiny by a disgruntled battleship crew,joined in revolt by the civilian populace against a brutal Tsarist regime,the film goes far beyond political propaganda.With its masterful symphonic structure,prodigious choreography and above all the dynamic and suitably revolutionary montage editing (peaking in the celebrated Odessa Steps sequence)it remains a highly impressive accomplishment. Strike (brilliant also), October , Alexander Nevsky (stunning black and white cinematography) and Ivan the Terrible 1 and 2 (Daring,operatic style) are other Eisenstein classics worth seeing.
