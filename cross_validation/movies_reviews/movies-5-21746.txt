This is truly a masterpiece of a movie. It has the grandeur, the thrills, the excitement of a blockbuster; and yet has the beauty and heart of an independent film. A great thing about this film is, unlike other famous trilogies, Return of the King can stand on its own. It is so fabulous that you don't have to have watched the previous two or even be a Lord of the Rings fan to appreciate this film. Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Sean Astin as Samwise gave outstanding performances! Peter Jackson completed his masterpiece with vision, talent and hopefully the Academy will grace this fantastic film with some gold statues. I recommend this movie to everyone!
