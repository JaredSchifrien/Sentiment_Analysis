Great movie from a great author. It was included in the book DIFFERENT SEASONS by Stephen King. Also in the four novellette collection was THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and APT PUPIL, which were also made into great movies. Will Wheaton in his pre-STAT TREK days was brilliant for the first and only time in his thankfully brief career.
