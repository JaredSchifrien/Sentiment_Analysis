Five stars all the way! Wayne and Garth offer a great look into the mind of the hard rocking youth of 80's America. Garth was my hero when I was younger. This movie is a great blend of comedy and even a little drama. Well, maybe not. Whoever thinks that kids from SubUrbia are boring. You're wrong! This movie is EXCELLENT! Sha.
