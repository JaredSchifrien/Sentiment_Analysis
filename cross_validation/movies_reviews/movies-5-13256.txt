Excellent movie. Tom Cruise and the actor playing Ray worked so well together making this movie. The film draws in the attention of the viewer as well as the viewer's sense of compassion for the characters. The sensitive side of a hard working strong man is brought out by the loveable character, Ray, his brother.
