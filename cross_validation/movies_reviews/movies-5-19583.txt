One of my person favorite horror movies, much better then most others before it on this list. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Anne Heche are the stand outs of the show, stealing every scene that they are in. Probably wasn't the smartest thing to waste all their amunition on a knock out chase scene between Gellar and the fisherman killer, which leaves you on the edge of your seat throughout, and leave nothing for the climax. Still a great film, with lots of pretty people!
