One of the all-time greatest movies ever made. I was 7 years old when it came out, and it's hard to describe what a huge impact it had on my life at the time. I wanted Star Wars everything: action figures, trading cards, pillowcases, posters, you name it. I must have badgered my mom to take me to see the movie over 10 times in the theater. Star Wars was exponentially better than any science fiction movie that preceeded it. The special effects, for one thing, were shockingly more advanced than anything we'd seen before. And the story tapped into powerful myths, making it resonate with people at a deeper level than most films. George Lucas was a big fan of Joseph Campbell (an amazing teacher and author in the field of mythology), and Lucas incorporated a lot of Campbell's ideas of The Hero's Journey into Star Wars. Possibly the best tribute to Star Wars is the fact that it still holds up today - 95% of the other movies made at that time seem so dated when you watch them now that they're a joke. But Star Wars endures as a science fiction classic.
