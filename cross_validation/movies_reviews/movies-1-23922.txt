A movie for geriatrics. Old people who get a renewed vigor due to sucking the life force of a couple of unhatched aliens. This is supposed to be an uplifting film? Probably the biggest and worst oversight is that with all the renewed vigor, they still have thin, old, disgusting bodies they you to frolic with. Gross!
