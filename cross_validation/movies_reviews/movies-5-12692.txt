"Trekkies" is a rather endearing portrait of Star Trek fandom. Pretty much as you'd expect, this means lots of interviews with omnipresently costumed obsessives whose living rooms perfectly resemble the bridge of the Enterprise. However, the most entertaining reflections on the Trek fandom come from the experiences of the Star Trek actors themselves. Brent Spiner and Denise Crosby comment on spookily realistic naked portraits of themselves sent by fans, John De Lancie recounts people confronting him on the street to ask if he can really resurrect the dead and Nichelle Nichols talks of how a young girl once saw her on television at a time when black actresses in important roles were virtually non-existent, and was inspired to pursue an acting career herself. That girl's name was Whoopi Goldberg. It's feel-good stories like this that make the film so pleasant. Star Trek, whilst being merely a popular television franchise, has always espoused fundamentally good moral messages like sexual and racial equality, acceptance of diversity and the ideal of working for the purpose of fulfillment rather than simple monetary gain. Though often satirical, the film basically presents the idea that Trekkies have absorbed from Star Trek, amongst an advanced knowledge of Klingon linguistics and a penchant for wearing pointy ears, some pretty good axioms to live by.
