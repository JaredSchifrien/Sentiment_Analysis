Very funny movie. I saw this as a teenager. I must admit I went reluctantly because a friend wanted to see the movie and I wanted to be polite. I was so glad I saw this. All the actors are great in their roles. Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, Peter Boyle, Terri Garr and Cloris Leachman all great.! Nd so is Madeleline Kahn. One of my favorite scenes is after young Frankenstein created a new Frankenstein he escapes and ends up at a blind man's house {well played by Gene Hackman}.Alot of other funny scenes too. For a good laugh i would reccomend this movie.
