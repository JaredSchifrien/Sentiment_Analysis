ooooohhhhh nnnooooo. You just did not put this piece of trash before the Omen..or even the freaking Lost Boys, for that matter. Johnny Depp's acting was horrendous and campy (even when one considers that he pretty much did everything with his part that he could.)and it seemed almost as painful for him to say those bland, terrible lines as it was for me to listen to them. The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a horse beaten to death..why can't we just let it rest in peace? What really rubs me the wrong way,though, is that Tim Burton directed this film. You don't make a masterpiece like the Nightmare Before Christmas and then do..whatever the hell this was. If you want to fully experience said tale then read the book by Washington Irving. Please don't see this movie Oh, and Christopher, honey... why? no, really, why would you do that to yourself?...
