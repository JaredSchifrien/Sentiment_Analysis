I enjoyed the movie very much! It was very exciting. I loved Hugh Jackman's potrayal of Logan/Wolverine. Wolverine had never been my favorite X-men (Gambit has always been my X-Man, I was a bit disappointed to hear his character would not be portrayed in the movie). Don't get me wrong I like all the X-Men. But now thanks to Mr.Jackman, his portrayal has gave Wolverine such sex appeal, that if I were Jean Grey I could not just set him aside. Any way the movie was fantastic!See it if you haven't! (sorry Gambit)
