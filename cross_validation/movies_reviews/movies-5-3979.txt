A terrific movie about a magical nanny who takes the children she watches on wonderful adventures. Takes place in England in 1910. Dad is a banker who has no time for his kids. Mom is a suffragette who also has little time for Jane and Michael Mary Poppins arrives after the children write their own letter for a nanny.Julie Andrews is wonderful as Mary Poppins, so is Dick Van Dyke as Bert. my favorite part is when they jump through the pictures in the park. and they mix animation with live action.good songs too!
