I watched this movie expecting to be bored out of my mind, but to my surprise, I could not stop laughing! My preconception of the movie was that I wouldn't enjoy watching it because it centers around golf (I am not a golf fan), but I found it to be one of the most hilarious movies I have ever seen...you don't have to be a golf know-it-all to like it. My favorite scene is the fist fight between Bob Barker and Happy...it is one the funniest scenes in comedy-movie history; it's definitely a classic. Anyways, a real funny movie starring a real funny guy...fun to watch over and over again for some laughs!
