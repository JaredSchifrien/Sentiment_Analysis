This is the second Greatest film of all time after Lawrence of Arabia both directed by David Lean, the best director ever. A tragic love story on an epic scale set against the background of the Russian revolution. The whole cast gave great performances Julie Christie (Lara) is remarkably beautiful. The movie is atmospheric and visually stunning like all of David Leans films, you really feel like it was filmed in Russia even though it was filmed mostly in Finland and Spain. It was not filmed in Canada, Great cinematography and a great score. Doctor Zhivago should have won best picture and best director award, instead they gave it to the Sound of Music not a very good film. A big mistake by the academy awards, i think the only reason they gave the award to the Sound of Music was because Fox Studios was nearly bankrupt so they gave them an undeserving boost. Doctor Zhivago is a 10 times better movie.
