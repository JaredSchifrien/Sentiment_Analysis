I really like this movie. I'd watch it a thousand times...The Evil Dead didn't go with the cute jokes and conventional thought for most horror movies. This movie had one thing on its agenda: for people to die. And, die they did. The special effects, while so obviously so, are just gross-looking enough to make you want to gag anyway (and very few things make me want to gag anymore, considering the number of horror movies I've seen). The start of it was great. I didn't think the trees would actually possess her...I thought they'd just raped her (and I thought that was unneccessary, too...). The scene with Ashley attempting to dismember his dead girlfriend was pretty cool. Sam Raimi did a great job on this. Hm. And I'm actually a little put-off by the people who felt they had to leave giant paragraphs of practically nothing more than them referring to themselves in the third person. It makes them sound like deluded egomaniacs.
