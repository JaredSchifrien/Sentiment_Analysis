I'll admit...I'm a huge fan of chick flicks. The sweeter, the sappier, the better. Of the many romantic comedies out there, this is one of the best. Tom Hanks is charming and fantastic as ever. I'm not a big fan of cutesy Meg Ryan but this is one of her best. I love that they never meet until the end and you're still convinced they're perfect for each other. A classic happy ending tale.
