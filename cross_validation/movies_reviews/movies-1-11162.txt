Just see the first one. The other two are like a bunch of Saturday Night Live sketches lumped together and dragged out as much as humanly possible. The biggest laugh was when Ozzy Osborne was shown, just for how dated the movie will be in a few years. The first one was funny and original, they should have just left it alone after that.
