Intriguing, especially when I think about the similarities and differences between the Marine boot camp and the Canadian military boot camp I went through. The boot camp scenes were the best part of the movie but seeing the microcosm of that unit moving through Hue City in what was one of the Marines defining moments made (please forgive the cliche) history come alive.
