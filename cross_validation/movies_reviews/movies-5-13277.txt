I lOVED Saving Private Ryan; the best WW 2 two film I have ever seen. The cinamatogrophy was excellent, the acting was amazing, the realizem of the film is right on, and the over all story isjust entralling and inspiring. Steven Speilsberg did a superb job. The story of a sguad led by Cpt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) that storm the beach of Normady in one of the most horrific days in American history. Speilsberg, by the way did a great job of putting you in the middle of this horrible battle. The sguad is afterward sent on a special mission to find and bring home a Pvt. James Ryan somewhere in the German infested hills of France. while looking Ryan the sguad begins to doubt the mission and if it is worth risking the lives of these eight men to save one.Just an encredable film that leaves you with a knot in your throut from beginning to end. I give it ***** stars. Content: Strong Graphic War Violence, and Language (16 F-BOMBS).
