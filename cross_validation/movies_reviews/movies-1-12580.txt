I was bored, looking for a quick laugh. I didn't find any laughs with this movie. Recycled plots, poor direction. And the cinema had a 15 minute rule. If you walk out in the first 15 minutes you get your money back. I didn't know this. I walked out after about 20 minutes of this movie. Don't waste your time or money with the Kranks...
