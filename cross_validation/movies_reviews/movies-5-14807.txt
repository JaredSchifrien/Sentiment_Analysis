'It's such a perfect day, I'm glad I spent it with you!' I very darkly humoured look at heroin addiction in Edinburgh. Sharp, wittly, caustic and full on intelligent social commentary. THE film which propelled Ewan McGregor towards Hollywood stardom. Robert Carlyle gives his best performance I've seen to date as the dysfunctional alcoholic Begbie. If you liked this try watching Shallow Grave. Not quite as good but still has Danny Bolye's tar black sense of humour.
