Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda, and Dolly Parton had such great screen chemistry that they actually made a weak script into something awesome ! I really think this movie would have been a huge flop if it wasn't for the chemistry of these 3 women. Great movie, great comedy, and I could watch it over and over. Great storyline as well !
