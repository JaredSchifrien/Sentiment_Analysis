Not fit to hold Wrath of Khan's jockstrap. The only reason this movie (or any of the later movies, especially the old Trek/TNG crossovers) succeed is that there is a nation of pasty, maladjusted Trekkies out there sustaining that industry from the comfort of their parents' basements. I like Trek too, especially because it is such a deeply detailed subject, but these movies are just pander.
