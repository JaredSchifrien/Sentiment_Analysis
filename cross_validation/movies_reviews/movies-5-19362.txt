As far as entertainment goes, both Scream movies are pretty much neck and neck. But the best film of the two is definately this one! This is the perfect example of what a modern-day horror movie is all about. Along with Silence of the Lambs Scream, this is probably one of the best horror movies of the 90s, if you ask me.
