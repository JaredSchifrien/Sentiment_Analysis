What a great film. If you haven't seen it - where have you been living? Under a rock? Completely original, fantastic, great. It deserves all its 5-star glory. If you haven't seen it, SEE IT! I really loved the way the cartoons and real people mixed, it was amazing when I saw it first. It's essential. Too bad Bob Hoskins ended out making Super Mario Bros. Summary: GREAT AND HILARIOUS.
