the first hour of this movie i couldnt stand its glamorized romance depiction ( snuggling on rocks overlooking an amazing coastline ). But throughout the movie i became more and more interested and hooked on it. It had magnificant battling and a fantastic ending. I liked it more than i thought i would while watching it after it ended.
