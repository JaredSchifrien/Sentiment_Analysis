Not only the finest version of Frankenstein I've ever seen,this was probably also one of the best movies of any category.This version follows the story of Shelleys more closely and eschews cheap thrills and worn out cinematic tricks to elevate the story into the realm of psychology and philosophy- Without detracting from the spookiness one iota.Brilliant Cinematography,excellent acting (it took me awhile to recognize DeNiro!) and that certain something that really takes you there that so many movies sadly lack.A must see for any discerning connisseur of Quality Horror or Gothic themes.
