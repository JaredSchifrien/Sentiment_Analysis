The first installment of five from Kevin Smith's View Askew series ( Clerks , Mallrats , Chasing Amy , Dogma and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back ), and though the character development is a bit dry (dialog written as if for only one person), the dialog itself is BRILLIANT and hysterical! Definately not for young children. The movie was shot in black white, and it's low-budget, but it was a good movie. Definately a great introduction to the View Askew series.
