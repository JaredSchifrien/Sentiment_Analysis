Some joker suggests Wesley Snipes was in this movie. Duh? Actually, this is classic Hitchcock, although, the last scene was edited out which explains why the birds acted the way they did. You have to read the book to get the answer, but it is a good read also. Tippi Hedren is hot, just my type! Rod Taylor, a very good actor (Hotel), does his thing well also. The suspense builds and the playground scene when the birds are gathering and the kids are in the schoolroom singing 'Wissletee, wassletee' oblivious or the danger is a perfect example of the medium Hitchcock excelled in. It is a dark movie. Someone suggested it should have been done in black and white..well it was, I have it. You must have seen the Ted Turner colorized version.
