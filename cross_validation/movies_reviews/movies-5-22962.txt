One of my favorite movies of all time with one of my favorite actors. All of the sequels are terrible, but this movie's social commentary seems to be unplanned while being ever present. This film's plot is well developed, and while Charlton Heston's character shows some development, most of the apes are lacking in that respect. Rod Serling's work on the film was fantastic. While it was not able to hold to the book in which the apes are in a far more sophisticated society than that of the movie, the movie has a great quality which could not be duplicated in todays cinematic climate. If you liked the Twilight Zone, this movie will be one for you. This film's costumes and makeup, while being state of the art at the time, are very bad, and nothing postitive can be said for the sequels which were simply a form of profit from the original, each becoming cheaper and cheaper, and the stories becoming thinner and thinner.
