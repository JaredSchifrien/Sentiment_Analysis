 A Streetcar Named Desire is a terrific movie. The acting is phenomenal across the board, but Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh steal the show. With a twisted, dark plot, the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. It's about a woman with a mysterious past who goes to stay with her sister and brother-in-law in the French Quarter in New Orleans. At first, the sister stands out as the strange one, but then you begin to glimpse the dark underbellies of the other characters. It's pretty creepy to see how the plot unfolds. If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend renting it or catching it when it's on TV.
