i thought it was probably one of the best movies i've seen this hole year! it had a great....no wait an awesome start and a awesome ending! unlike all the other movies i've seen this year, great start..but then its like the fvcking writer fell asleep at the end! i think the X-men Movie REEKS OF AWESOMENESS! and for the ones that think it sucks, well....no one takes advise from someone that watches richard simmons workout tapes and put up pictures of Mr.Rogers on there wall, enough to tilt there trailer! have a very nice day...or night, whatever! Xmen rule!!!!!
