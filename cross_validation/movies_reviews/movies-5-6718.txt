 The Thing From Another World is a great science fiction film, possibly the greatest of all the science fiction films of the 1950s. Sure, we don't see much of The Thing, but his presence is there. The very thought that could come from around the corner, or through the wall at any moment is very frightening, and I can imagine how kids movie-goers felt when they saw this film on the big screen for the first time. I love this movie.
