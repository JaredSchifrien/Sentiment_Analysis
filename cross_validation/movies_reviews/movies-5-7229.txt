The best comedy to come out of the 1980s. Without a doubt, it is John Candy's best movie. It's a shame he didn't get more roles like this one. It may very well be the movie that cemented the fact that Steve Martin could be funny without putting an arrow through his head. The R rating is a little misleading. If not for the 30 F-bombs Martin drops in the car rental scene, this probably would have gotten a PG-13, if not a PG.
