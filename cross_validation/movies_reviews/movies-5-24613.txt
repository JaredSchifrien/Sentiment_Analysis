I give Planet Of The Apes(2001)five stars, it is one of the best sci-fiction filmS( next to Star Wars). It 's my favorite movie so far. The end of the movie may not make sense to some people, but it is still a good film and worth watching. My favorite part in the movie,is where General Thade (Tim Roth) looks right at Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg)and said This one looked at me ..i loved that part. PLANET OF THE APES (2001)RULEZ!!!
