Welcome to Woodstock with more action and better music. This is the build up to the classic Stones show at Altamont. Hell's Angels provided security for the concert. They also stabbed a man(who, in fairness to the Angels, was brandishing a gun) to death and beat the hell out of many others, including Marty from Jefferson Airplane. This one is at times quite surreal. Gimme Shelter is the Apocalypse Now of rockumentarys. A Must see for any Rolling Stones fan. It was filmed at the height of their musical prime.
