A very nearly perfect film. Watch it on video and use slo-mo and stop action to analyse some of the scenes-- you'll be amazed by Keaton's incredible timing. Unlike Chaplin, Keaton never asked you to feel sorry for him. He was always a tough little guy who was simply determined to do his job. He does it here to perfection. My nomination for the greatest of silent films.
