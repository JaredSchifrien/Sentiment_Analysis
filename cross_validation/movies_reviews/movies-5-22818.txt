i was wowed by the effects, and having read the books, i felt that they stuck to the storyline as well as possible in order to tell the story in a timely matter. the attention to detail of the scenery, such as hogwarts and diagon alley was amazing, and the astors were equally well cast. it is an enchanting movie for children and adults.
