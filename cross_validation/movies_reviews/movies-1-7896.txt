This Is Spinal Tap was a failed attempt to spoof rock n roll groups, and it was directed by Rob Reiner. The characters in this film are totally annoying and crude, and they acts like total punks and fools. The music in this film is too loud and screeching to enjoy at the very least. I think that Rob went a bit too far with this one.
