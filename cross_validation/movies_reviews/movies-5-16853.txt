This movie evoked in me powerful emotions I haven't felt about a movie in a long, long while. Damon's acting was superb, up there with Good Will Hunting, and his on-screen relationship with Henry Thomas made it evident the two are off-screen friends. The cinematography is comparable to The Horse Whisperer, broad and sweeping and 'drop-everything-and-go-there' beautiful. It was truly a beautiful movie, full of passion, and I speak not only of the romance, which is somewhat underplayed for the role it plays in the movie. The most passion is found within John Grady Cole himself, the soul-searching, the self-inflicted guilt, the self-consciousness and willingness to do whatever (Alejandra) says. The dynamics of this character are very acurately portrayed. However, the editing seems a bit choppy--After I saw the movie, I thought several scenes could have been elaborated on, and, come to find out, they were. In Talk magazine for December and this month, he speaks of 'the four-hour version' of this movie, says that version is hands-down the best movie he's ever been in. I just hope they release that version, because this movie leaves me both with a great satisfaction, a pride in the human spirit, but also a longing to see more, hear more, for there to BE more, about these two men....and that unforgettable woman. Excellent.
