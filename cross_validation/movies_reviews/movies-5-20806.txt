I think a lot of people expected this movie to fail, but damn I don't care I loved it. I thought the court scenes might have been a tad bit overdramatic, but the chemistry between Renee and Catherine was amazing to me. The majority of the dance sequences were fantastic and who knew Catherine and Renee could dance? Great job by Anne Reinking, who played Roxie on stage, with the outstanding choreography.
