Cuba Gooding Jr. and Laurence Fishburne are excellent in this movie. This movie is a portrait of ghetto culture and is very realistic. I've seen it many times and actually use some of the lines in conversation with the boyz, You ain't 'posed to go to college to pull no bitches. Yo ass posed to be learnin' somethin. Ice Cube.
