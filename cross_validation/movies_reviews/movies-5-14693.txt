Erin Brockovich is an adaptation of a real story. For those people who know about the real case, it's a pretty good adaptation. Believe it or not, the movie is tamer than the truth. Yes, the real EB dresses like a whore. Not the way Julia Roberts dressed in the movie, but 10 times more revealing and she's open about it. Yes, the real EB has a gutter mouth. That's the way she talks and she's open about it. And when you're talking about this movie, don't forget the marvelous job that Albert Finney did as the crotchety Ed Masry. Unless you're predisposed to hate Julia Roberts, it's a must see.
