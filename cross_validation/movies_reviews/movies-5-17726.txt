The prototypical horror film. It has it all- bone chilling music, a dark, spooky atmosphere, a good plot, and the scariest guy to ever put on a captain kirk mask in Michael myers. His stealth, silence, and creative ways he caught his victims made halloween the most suspensefu; and scary movie to date.
