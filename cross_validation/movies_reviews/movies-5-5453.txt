I think that Bernard Herrman deserves a ton of credit for providing the soundtrack to many a Hitchcock classic. I anyone has heard the frenzied screeching in Psycho, or the spacey sounds of The Day the Earth Stood Still, that was his doing. Favourite quote for Northwest: That plane's dustin' crops where there ain't no crops! Little known fact: Hitchcock originally planned on calling the film The Man On Lincoln's Nose, but the national park people who handled Mt. Rushmore's publicity thought that the title was offensive to the treasured monument.
