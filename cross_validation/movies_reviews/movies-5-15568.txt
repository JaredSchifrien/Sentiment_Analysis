Woah, what's it doing way down here? Sure you're sick of it but you're the ones who watched it a million times. This was one of the best movies ever made, very touching. and not just the leo kate thing. I didn't however, like the fact that James Cameron didn't even dedicate his work to any of the original Titanic crew or there families. He just used the story line to sell tickets, people died and they should be tributed.
