 Easy Rider is indeed a must-see 1960's homage to the free spirit of that particular decade. Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper play the two leading heroes who are setting out on their bikes to conquer the ugly face of prejudice. Jack Nicholson serves as the scenestealer here, representing how ignorance can be molded away with the correct attitude. Extremely funny, moving, interesting and ultimately raw film experience. And what a fan-freaking-tastic trip scene that is yet to be matched in cinema. Killer soundtrack as well.
