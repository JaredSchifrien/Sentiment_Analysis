Billy Wilder's greatest creation includes three unforgettable characters all stuck in a terrible, despicable situation. Gloria Swanson giving the final line All right, Mr. Demille. I'm ready for my closeup is one of the great moments in cinema. This masterpiece shows the true callousness of Hollywood, the fleeting fancy of fame, and the dangers of delusion and idealism. One of the greatest movies about the movies ever made.
