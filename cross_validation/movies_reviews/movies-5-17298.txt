A wonderful movie. It really has two plots in one. Roberto Benigni{sp?} is terrific as a jewish man who in the first half of the movie fall in love and pursues the woman of dreams.The tactics he takes to win her over are funny and romantic. Coming in to her classroom pretending to be an inspector, following her to the theater and taking her for a ride. etc. Meanwhile the horror of the Holocaust is closing in on them and getting worse. The second half of the movie is when they are married and have an adorable five year old boy. Robertos character and his wife and son are taken to the concentration camp. The boy and dad are together. To keep Joshua from the horrors of what is really going on he invents a game for the boy to win a tank.This movie has some comedy. but it is shows the sacrifice the dad makes for his boy to get him through this horrific experience.
