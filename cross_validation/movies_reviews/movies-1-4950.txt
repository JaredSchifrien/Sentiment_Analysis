I really HATE Annie both the production and the kid. Unlike Mary Poppins which I liked in spite of some of the musical numbers, the musical side of Annie just seems to work against the story. I kept wanting to say SHUT up and tell me something. Also, if I want to see a bunch of kids sing who can t sing I ll accompany a friend or relative to their child s next grade school choir recital. Basically, I think a lot of shallow points all merged here to create one large annoying movie experience for me. Things like Annie s hair (comb it out you drip!), Carol Burnett s part (arrrgh what a jerk and not in a funny way), the grating songs (ahhhh, my ears), the lack of much of a plot (I stopped caring about her plight early on), the rushed pace (calm down and tell a story, will ya!). I was sorry I took a chance with this back when it was first released and wasted money on a ticket. No fear that I would ever rent it even for kids.
