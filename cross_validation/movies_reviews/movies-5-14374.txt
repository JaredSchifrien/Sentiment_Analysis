It is really great to see a movie that doesn't cop out at the end. Requiem For a Dream played at my local art theater (for far too short of a run)for about a week. I saw it twice. The first time I was completely blown away. I don't remember being so disturbed by a film. I loved it. Ellen Burstyn should get more than an oscar nomination. I can't remember when all of the aspects of film making came together so well as w/ the ending of that film. Selby is a great writer. I can't imagine his words being put into film more effectively. Wish I could see it again for the first time!
