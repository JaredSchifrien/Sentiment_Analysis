A great movie! I thought the whole cast was great. It is listed as a drama, but it had a number of hillarious scenes in the movie. I espcially loved the scene with Shelby's wedding and the red velvet cake shaped like an amarillo.AND IT IS NOT JUST A MOVIE FOR CHICKS! This movie will make you laugh and cry, just a really good movie.
