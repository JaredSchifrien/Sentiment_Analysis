Misery is one movie that you can't miss to see. Rob Reiner knew what to do here, and who to pick to get the job done. Kathy Bates plays a woman obsessed with this author, and when he gets into an accident, she takes him in. But, she is a very sick woman, in her mind, and she sometimes goes overboard and she starts abusing him with an axe.
