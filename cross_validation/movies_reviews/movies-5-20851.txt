I love this film! The cinematography explains so much detail and captures the life of the protagonists. The music, instead of how it's worked into the storyline normally in musicals, is done soely in the Cabaret (leaving out some good songs), so there is a more natural feeling. This is the only movie with Liza Minelle that she doesn't come across as just a horrible actress.
