In reading the works of the Marquis Desade, and being a writer myself, I find that when you exercise areas of your mind that bend human ferocity it is a doorway of individualism and identity, not just for the writer, but for what is seen through this particular artist. Sexuality is the binding element between humans, and as life grows so the structure of our existence will be altered. The human race as a whole are nothing more than cattle, wether they want to admit it, or not, and as cattle passes on and moves in certain directions when ordered to there will always be the necessity to disobey, and to rip, and to tear what is imagined as sacred. Sex is a weapon if it is utilized as such, and every person on this planet in one way or another, including myself most of all, will strike out at another persons heart 'just because you can'. I am not saying that indulging oneself with aggressive attack on another persons pysche is an old/new way to exercise your own personal prowess, however, I am intending to make the fragile point that it is in human nature for us to hurt one another's feelings through sex and through mere conversation. As a human animal on this planet I can truly say that the work of the Marquis Desade is more than a realm of free expression it is a teaching tool for the human spirit. Only tender minds have difficulty with adventurous sex and having one's heart hurt. This will happen, and as a person can torture themself with emotional negligence so they can feed a new purpose to describe their own private angers, frustrations, inhibitions, and nihilistic desires that open up new realms of mental terror through art, sex, and the scent of the human mind. I agree with Vegan Pride, I would give the movie another star, only six not seven, but only five are allowed. All these unnecessary rules.
