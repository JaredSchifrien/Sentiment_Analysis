Do I really have to explain why I'm giving this film one star, I'd give it none if I could. This is the biggest cash cow film in prbably the history of movies. It's one attempt after another at being slick and exciting. It fails in both respects. Only Bill Murray is worth what they paid him in this movie. Best Scene: Lucy Lu as the domanatrix/business woman.
