Dreadful, cheesy and corny "remake" of the original, which was a minor classic, and whatever else it may have been, and it was pretty cheesy in its own right, the original was a fairly unique and influential landmark in the development of sci- fi films. The makeup was indeed very good, and Tim Roth did a good job as usual, but the rest of this movie was atrocious. The plot in particular was abysmal.
