This is an EXCELLENT film. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys foreign films. Filmed in Taiwan it's the story of a father and his three daughters, on in high school and the other two adults and their differnt life paths, love interestes etc. Okay so that sounds kind of simple but it's very well done and very funny. The father used to be a chef at the Grand Hotel so there are lots of really visually stimulating cooking scenes. See this film!
