The only thing funnier than this movie are Ed Wood's real movies. The problem is, they weren't meant to be funny. He's a classic case of a guy who had nothing but an insatiable desire to make sci-fi flicks...and I mean nothing. The whole real-life story of poor Bela Lugosi and this guy is unbelievable, but true.
