I thought it was a great movie from the story to the acting to of course the directing. It kept my constant attention. It's the kind of movie you walk away from and can't stop thinking and talking about. My hubby's first words after it ended, It makes you feel like it's never too late to go out and accomplish whatever you want. It made us laugh, it made us cry, it made us feel. Wonderful performance by Russell Crowe, he really made it feel very real like you were right there going thru it all with him (Mr. Nash).
