Mel Gibson is a pandering opportunist who creates intense images that play on our religious and emotional sensitivities. The bible says that Jesus died for our sins but the economics of this movie proves that Mel Gibson is dying for our wallet. If he were anything better, he would be showing it in theaters for free.
