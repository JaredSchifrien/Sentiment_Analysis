Because it was produced, boxed and shown in movie theaters, this film gets a 1 rating. George Lucas is not only a racist but he has no creative taste or ability. Jar-Jar Binks performs the slave role quite well. All the scenes he is in can be used as a form of cruel and unusual punishment. Obi-Wan, played by McGregor, looks hungover in all of his scenes, while Liam Neeson decided that Lucas did not pay him enough to show emotion. The best actor was the 9 year old who, half way through the film, he also joins his fellow actors in emotionless acting. Stay away from this film.
