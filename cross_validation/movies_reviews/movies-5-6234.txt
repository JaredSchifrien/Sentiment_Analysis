A truly great masterpiece. A great cast, crackerjack script, sharp, witty and edgy dialogue. It is Bogart's second best performance after Rick Blaine. Amazing debut of Sydney Greenstreet who isn't 2nd to Bogart in performance, he's equal to him, and at times maybe even better. A brilliant film noir classic.
