A 1.5. I will give it an extra half point because Gigli at least did not hurt the mentally disabled person he kidnapped. othewise this is flat out boring movie. the dialogue is awful. the plot is stupid. Even though I do not think that Jennifer Lopez is a great actress, i have seen her act better in other movies. she was not convincing as a tough hit woman. Even Ben Affleck came on a talk show and said it was not a very good movie. Glad I only spent 99cents to try out this one.
