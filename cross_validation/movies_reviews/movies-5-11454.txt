This was a wonderful movie. I saw it with my 15 yr old daughter and couldn't stop laughing! The characters are wonderful. It is very refreshing without the usual violence and gratuitous sex scenes. Teenagers will love it, at least mine did. I may go see it again, I hear I missed something when I left during the end credits. Even from the opening credits, it was so creative and fun.
