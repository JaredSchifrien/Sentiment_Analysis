I mean honestly, KUBRICK is not that good at all. He has always been overrated, and especially this particular movie of his. It sucked real bad, and this is honestly one of those times when I can say the word suck, and that is exactly what this movie did..it was just horrendous in every way. It started out wierd, and ended wierd. Most people would be confused by this whole atrocity, so I don't recommend it to anyone. It is the beginning of many bad movies by this director....
