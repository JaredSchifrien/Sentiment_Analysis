I walked out of the theater shaking. I haven't seen a movie this intense since... well, I don't know if I've ever seen another movie this intense. There are some scenes with so much hellfire and brimstone and insanity. Emily Watson was wonderful. I saw this when the D.C. sniper was still lurking about (though I was in no personal danger, it was still scary for all of us) and Dragon deals with the same idea, perhaps: a seemingly-random killer with a bit of an unhealthy disposition. But wow, what a movie to see. Anthony Hopkins is spectacular- his role is similar to that of Silence of the Lambs . Good flick- especially for seeing in the theater.
