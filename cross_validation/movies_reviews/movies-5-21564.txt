I cannot begin to express my utmost disappointment that Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship, did not win an Academy Award for Best Picture. Don't get me wrong a Beautiful Mind is a fantastic film, but when you look at the battle sequences in TFOTR and the amazing computer generated characters with such detail and smooth movements not to mention the honesty of the book to the film keeping characters, storyline and themes in place you can't really fault this film.
