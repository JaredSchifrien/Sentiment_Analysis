This is one of my 2 favorite movies; the other is Babe, Pig in the City. Babe is probably better for children, but BV is virtually flawless as a cinematic experience. I liked it much more on the second viewing than the first; there aren't many movies that I can say that about. Mulholland Drive is great also.
