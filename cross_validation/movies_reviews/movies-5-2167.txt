There is so much that's cool about this movie that I will only mention a few things. First, I really enjoyed the dynamic between silence and loudness in this film. During the freeway shootout, the gunshots were incredibly LOUD, as they are in real life, not these little pops that come from most movie-guns. When you have an assault rifle firing away for minutes at a time, you will probably be deaf for a little while in that ear. This made the whole thing more realistic, and yet a little surreal at the same time. Also, the showdown at the airport, when Pacino is chasing DeNiro through the transformers, had a lot of silence and noise. It would be totally dark and quiet while they are creeping through the night, and periodically a plane would fly over and the whole theater would be filled with incredible light and noise, and then it would fade again. This is one of my favourite movies, and it stars the two greatest crime-drama actors in history. If you haven't seen it yet, you'd better have a damn good excuse, like maybe you've been living in a monastery in Tibet for the past seven years. Even then, shame on you.
