Even when I see Natalie Portman in films such as Star Wars II, I still think of her as an execeptionally sweet little girl in 'Leon'. Directed by Luc Besson, starring the above Natalie, Jean Reno, Gary Oldman. This is a story of Mathilda who is orphaned by twisted cop Gary Oldman who kills his family because of some missing cocaine that her father was taking care of. Mathilda is taken in by Leon and a beautiful relationship between the two characters grow. Leon is a hitman who is extremely childlike and simple. He kills without thinking, but takes great care in looking after his pot plant. Mathilda wants to become a 'cleaner' like Leon so she can revenge her little brothers death - but ends up in trouble herself and Leon saves her. I won't ruin it for you by telling you exactly what happens - you'll have to watch it yourself. this is a beautiful simple film - quite timeless.
