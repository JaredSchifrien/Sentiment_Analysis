If you liked the other 2 Indiana Jones movies than you probably won't like this one. Filled with cheep laughs and dumb one-liners. It tries to be more of a comedy than an action movie. Harrison Ford is still good, but the supporting cast could have come off of a street somewhere in any city in America. With few good parts, though admittedly their are a few, this is a major dissapointment.
