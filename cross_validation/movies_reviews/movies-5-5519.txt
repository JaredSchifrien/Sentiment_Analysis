Hitchcock's best film, and the movie that started a new genre of film. The slasher movie would not exist without this gritty, disturbing, surprising and utterly terrifying masterpiece of obsession, schitzophrenia, lust, and perversity. There is no Halloween, no Texas Chainsaw Massacre, no Friday the 13th, no Nightmare on Elm Street, and no Scream without this film. And believe it or not, this is still the best one of them all. The Citizen Kane of horror films, and one of cinema's greatest directors greatest achievment.
