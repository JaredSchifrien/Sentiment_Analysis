This movie has so many hidden funny lines. I love the part when one of the senior girls yells, fry like bacon you freshmen bitches! There are some big actors in this movie and they all do a great job. Everyone can relate to this movie. It is the classic coming of age story. There are so many characters in this movie and you are bound to have friends that are similar to the characters in this movie. It take place in the 70's and that just adds to the film. It is a favorite of mine. You can watch it over and over and it just gets better.
