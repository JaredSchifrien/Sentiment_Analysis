One of the greatest movies of all time. I found my self puzzled and thrilled. There is a never ending climax to this movie. The plot, and story line is great. Amazing actors and acting take this film from a story board and turn it into a real in your face sort of movie. Great movie, deff. worth buying or renting. -sliptodd-
