In the case of this film, the plot is not as realistic and extreme as the scenery, actions/words, and the truth to the era. I personally advise that non-WWII veterans see this movie, because possibly the acting and the backgrounds are so realistic that it could cause recurring bad or even traumatic memories to the viewer, and trigger unwanted emotions from that time in their lives that could send them into tears or fear. One good side is that it does a good job in showing just how incredibly influential WWII was, and it gives the viewer a good idea of the struggles, both military and personal. We, as Americans had to endure and win what could have been history's ultimate battle between good and evil.
