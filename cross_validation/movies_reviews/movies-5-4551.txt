Pixar movies are the closest thing to sure thing when it comes to box office revenue and critical acclaim (though Monsters Inc. didn't do much for me). The Incredibles was a great family movie. The kids loved it and it had enough to keep adult minds thoroughly engaged. The film's theme is one any middle-aged person can relate to -- making a comeback after years of dormancy and mediocrity. The animated Superhero had its day in my generation but seemed to fade away as the 1-ounce brains peddled dreck like the Smurfs and Strawberry Shortcake as a means to make children's minds less violent, I guess (didn't quite work either). The CGI technology keeps getting better and seems vastly improved over Toy Story 10 years ago. The Incredibles does a great job in entertaining us, as well as teaching a little lesson on self-esteem and not accepting mediocrity. Should be the favorite for best animated feature at the Oscars.
