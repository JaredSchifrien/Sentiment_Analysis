This movie is brilliant, possibly the best I've ever seen. It is a heartwarming story about inter- racial relationships, and overcoming tragic losses to become what you have always dreamed of becoming. Julia Stiles Sean Patrick Thomas are jammin'. They portray their characters so well, and are obviously very talented in both acting and dance. The story is well wrote, giving great depth on what really goes on in the real America, outside the glossy Hollywood. Well done Thomas Carter, a brilliant movie. Well done also to the writer(s), and all actors, especially Julia Sean! Absoloutly Brilliant! PS. Sean is a real sizzler, and just for the record I am not Afican American.
