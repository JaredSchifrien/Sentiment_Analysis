this movie was great! i am a huge fan of the evil dead trilogy, and this is one of my favorites. just like army of darkness, is your looking to be scared, this is not the movie to watch, this movie is hilarious.bruce campbell does it again with his great one liners and great acting. bruce campbell is my hero. bruce campbell is back at the cabin this time with his girlfriend. he dicovers a tape player, plays it and the adventure begins. yet another perfect blend of horror and comedy. sam raimi is a genius. i highly reccomend that you see this movie, a guarunteed laugh riot! gotcha you little sucker
