This movie is entirely without merit. I am a SciFi fan, but this movie was beyond saving almost at the beginning when I caught a glipst of Tim Robbins' futuristic car. I get enough Jerry O'Connell on the SciFi channel. I don't need any more in a movie because he always leads me to ask: Is it possible to act any less? This one must have looked good on paper, but the feelings and emotions of the characters are not well conveyed through the screen, nor is the concept believable. I am amazed that so many recognizable names signed on to this terd.
