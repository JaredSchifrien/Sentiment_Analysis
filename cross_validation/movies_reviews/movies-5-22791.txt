I have read the book and have see the movie. Both were great. I was pleased to see that they followed the book so closely. To anyone who will not watch or read Harry Potter because they think witchcraft is evil, my grandfather, a devoted southern baptist preacher, has read all the books and seen all the movie so far produced and loves them and finds the stories to be a wonderful creation of fantasy. So to those nah-sayer, what's next, boycott Wizard of Oz and at least half the Disney movies ever created, burn David Copperfield alive. It's a story, and a good one at that!
