This movie should and will leave you sobbing. It takes you on an emotional roller coaster, from sublime to heartbreak. The tragedy is that the movie is true, and it's so sad when you realize people can be so cruel. (More conservative people might not enjoy this flick, but I suggest they see it anyway. It might open their eyes.)
