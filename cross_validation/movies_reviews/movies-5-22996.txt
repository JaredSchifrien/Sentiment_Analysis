Although this film requires a good attention span, it is well worth it. The implications of the symbolism are thought provoking. This one film deals with the essence of humanity; where did we came from, where are we going, what is our place in the universe. It is exciting; sometimes frightening and disturbing. The special effects were stupendous for it's time, they changed the standard for the sci-fi industry.
