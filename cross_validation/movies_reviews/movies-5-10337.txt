Released in 2002 and directed by Alexander Payne, About Schmidt is a dark comedy that has a very flat, intentionally plodding pace. The film almost exclusively centers around Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson) who is forced into retirement from his job as an insurance actuary. Schmidt quickly finds that his wife is essentially a stranger, and he turns to sponsoring an orphan boy in Africa named Ndugu. After his wife unexpectantly dies and in search of entertainment and change, Schmidt purchases an RV and begins a trip to Colorado to try to stop his daughter (Hope Davis) from marrying a waterbed salesman (Dermot Mulroney). Arriving in Colorado, Schmidt is faced with his future in-law (Kathy Bates). Viewers looking for more action miss the point of this film as the humor is intentionally dark and dialogue driven, and the pace is intentionally plodding to match the aura of Schmidt's new life. Though the in-laws are supposed to be portrayed as eccentric and over the top, Bates' persona was a bit excessive; however, Davis as Schmidt's no frills daughter was wonderful. What makes this film work is the casting and effort of Nicholson who can portray a man boiling inside, yet never erupts save within the anonymity of his letters to Ndugu which are the highlights of the film and move the story along. The bottom line is that About Schmidt is a cerebral black comedy that is not for everyone, but a must see for those who like the genre.
