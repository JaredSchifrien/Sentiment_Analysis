I absolutely LOVED this movie. It's one of those few films that captures a little place in the past somewhere and just creates this little world with eccentric characters, and everyone is on a quest. When their paths cross, hilarity ensues on a grandiose scale. Every aspect of the cinematography, music, sound, and editing blend to create this movie to absolute perfection. Absolutely hilarious as well, the best laugh out loud movie the Cohen Brothers have done.
