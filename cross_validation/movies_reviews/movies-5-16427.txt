One of my now favorite films. A truely stunning directorial debute by Sophia Coppola. Her flair for that which is visually beautiful and dark is amazing. I've heard from alot of people who didn't like the ending. Why did the girls kill themselves? Why is the sky blue? What is the meaning of life? Why do we all want the easy answer? Why must it all be pre packaged and handed to us? Must there be an answer for everything? I didn't ask. I just watched and marveled at such an imaginative portrait of love and lost. A very deep and meaningful film. A work of art.
