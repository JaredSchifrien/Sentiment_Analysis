One of my all-time favorites...Cagney was the best, by his own admission he was simply a Song Dance Man ...This movie was actually the George M. Cohen story and Cagney was born for the part. There are some great songs, great dancing (nobody made it look easier than Jimmy with his rubbery legs) and a nicely told story of a true American hero.
