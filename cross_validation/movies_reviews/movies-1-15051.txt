Talk about a boring, pointless, disappointing movie! I mistakenly thought that Girl, Interrupted was going to be a moving, inspirational story about a woman confronting serious mental illness. Instead, the main character (played by Winona Ryder) has no legitimate reason for committing herself to a mental institution, and viewers are subjected to watching her pathetic, self-indulgent behavior as she finds herself among the crazies. Even worse- the movie drags on and on, and I feared it would never end. I started feeling suicidal myself during the last third of the movie and only watched the rest because my husband wanted to see the ending. You have been warned!
