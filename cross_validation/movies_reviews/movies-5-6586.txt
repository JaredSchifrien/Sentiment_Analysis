While visiting my 78-year old dad, we watched it on AMC. Unbeknownst to me, my pop seems to have watched this movie a dozen times and knew every line and every scene like so many Rocky Horror revelers. Though I am not the biggest John Wayne fan, this one is great. The veiled sexuality between Wayne and Sizzling hot red-head Acollene Maureen O'Hara is palpable -- even in 1952. It was neat when O'Hara confides a very discreet issue on their inability to consummate their marriage with the town priest (Ward Bond) in Gaelic. Victor McLaglan and the Duke have one of the best Hollywood Fights in history. The Irish locales are visually stunning. Overall, a real treat I was glad to share with Pops. Seek it out.
