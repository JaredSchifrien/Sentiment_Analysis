A shameless Clinton apology from the Meathead. Meathead, I thought you were ACTING when you played ultra-liberal Mike Stivic. I was wrong. Stick with compelling films like This is Spinal Tap, The Princess Bride, and even A Few Good Men (has liberal leanings, but was told in a compelling way - not an attempt to brainwash like recent Meathead films). Let me tell you something buddy: You are a MEATHEAD - dead from the neck up. MEAT-HEAD.
