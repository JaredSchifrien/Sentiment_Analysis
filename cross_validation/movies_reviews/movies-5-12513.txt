I was at first frustrated by the movie. I loved the breath-taking cinematography, the acting, the score, the subtle messages of confusion and the over all story but I did not feel a connection between Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar. I did not understand why, when they were not consummating their relationship, they were distant; apart. I felt that this was a flaw in the movie that weaves in and out of a 20-year “love affair.” Then I realized the brilliance of this movie- it examines the relationship between two real men who are struggling with their own sexuality and identity while trying to express a pure love they do not understand. They simply don't know what to do with their with their intense feelings, except to express with child-like frolicking, fierce testosterone driven anger and fierce love-making (there are only two brief scenes so straight men can watch it easily). GO SEE THIS MOVIE for the subtle topics it tackles, love, loss, the blame society must take for robbing these beautiful creatures of their pure love, and for victimizing people who simply want to understand themselves and the one they want to love. This is by far a breathtaking masterpiece and the best movie of the year.
