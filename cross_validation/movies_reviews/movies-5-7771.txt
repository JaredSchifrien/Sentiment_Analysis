Adam Sandler is hilarious and I loved this movie! My favorite scenes have to be when he was singing into the intercom that went to the outside of his apartment I wanna kiss you all over and the old Chinese lady came up and you think that is funny but then they show him running out the next morning and she is wearing his shirt and says Hey you don't want breakfast?! then you think GROSS! Also when he sends his grandmother to a retirement home and Ben Stiller plays the man in charge of the retirement home and he makes the grandmother's sew quilts so he can sell them!!!
