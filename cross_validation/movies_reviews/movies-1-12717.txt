More of a propoganda film that anything else. I'm a liberal, but I hate when my fellow liberals churn out false propoganda to brainwash the masses. Same for republicans and other politicians. Michael Moore may be a smart man, but he doesn't depict himself properly when all he does is piss and moan about one problem instead of adressing every aspect of it. FOR ONE THING, Michael Moore only adresses 4 countries in the world about gun violence. Look at some places in the middle east. Gun violence is worse there than America. We ought to go there and try and help those poor kids there. Michael Moore also spins some things out of control. SOme of the links he makes between gun violence and what causes it.......Jeez. In my opinion, What causes gun violence is poverty and overcrowding which also causes mental instability among many.
