In general this movie is very boring and quite predictable. Additionally, I will be forever bothered by the fact that the Science Fiction/ Fantasy community cannot arrive at a consensus as to whether or not silver kills a vampire. I like vampire movies and this one was just bad. I was very surprised that Omar Epps and Christopher Plummer actually made this movie. I honestly felt cheated after the movie. I cannot comment on plot or character development because there simply was none.
