great plot great acting great characters great music great ending. i truly enjoyed this movie, and i think i could see it again and find it equally entertaining... the plot is well developed and many-layered, and the actors do wonders with it. even if that weren't the case, it would be worth seeing just for the great soundtrack. 5 stars.
