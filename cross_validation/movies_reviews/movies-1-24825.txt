What was Travolta thinking? Barbarino in space. I kept falling asleep the first time so I thought I'd better watch it again. It was just as bad the second time. Some of the fx were cool but not good enough. I remember panning for gold when I was a kid and getting those big gold bars, NOT! Did Terl give them the smelting equipment? No. I can't beleave anyone set out to make a film this bad. Makes me wonder what was left on the cutting room floor. It's to bad that Rate It! wont let me give it ZERO STARS.
