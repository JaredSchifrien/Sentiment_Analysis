The actors couldn't save this movie from what it is. The whole premise of the movie and its screenplay is completely off. The biggest problem is that it is written for you to feel sorry for Sam (the retarded father) and for him regain custody of his 7 year old daughter. But every ounce of common sense sides with the bad guys that believe Sam should not have sole custody. The movie is aimed at making you feel that a father with an IQ of a 7 year old should be able to take care of his daughter himself. It just doesn't work.
