Orsen Wells was a genius and an artistic trail blazer. Most of his movies, including Citizen Kane , were way ahead of their time - fascinating from beginning to end. Another great one is The Magnificent Ambersons - a great look at the beginning of industrial America and life at the end of the 19th century.
