Quentin Tarantino came bursting onto the scene with this classy and thrilling thriller. Completely mixed up, there is no time here, the times change, this is great. Watch out for a cops ear, Mr. Blonde and a knife, this film was great. After the opening sequence in a bar it took me to a sickening sight of Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), and Mr. White (Harvey Kietel), in a car, Orange shot in the gut and White trying to comfort him while driving a car, this is entertaining as they get. Cool. Slick. Awesome. Three words that describe Tarantino's debut. Not quite as good as Pulp Fiction, but still damn good. See now. Summary: AN EXCELLENT, COOL THRILLER THAT IS A MUST-SEE.
