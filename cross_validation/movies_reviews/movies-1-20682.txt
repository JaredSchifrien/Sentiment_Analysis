The Sound of Mucus is more like it. Who is the world finds Julie Andrews at all appealling or entertaining? Gadzooks, she's one of the worst: I feel like I'm going to fall into a diabetic coma everytime she comes into the frame. Christopher Plumber, a truly gifted actor who's been gravely overlooked for decades, puts in a fine performance for a guy who's hardly the song and dance type, yet he doesn't actually sing or dance much in this flick. The children are obnoxious. The story is one of those typical Hollywood based on a true story feel-good bowel movements. There are a few decent songs in the score, but most of it is your usual musical filler. This was such a popular flick when it first came out, but looking at it today, it's hard to determine why. Of course, it's bland and easily digestible family fare, but please, it's so hokey and goody-goody that you just want to barf.
