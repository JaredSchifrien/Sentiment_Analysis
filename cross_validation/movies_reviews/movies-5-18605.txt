Now keep in mind that The Glory isn't a huge horror movie fan. Kind of a fan by association. But during a 1 year period The Glory had her fair share of scary-type movies. The Glory didn't think that this one that that scary or that gross. Perhaps the Glory is becoming desensitized. It doesn't matter, The Glory still enjoyed this, the first in the Evil Dead trilogy very much. The Glory did think that 'Ashley' was kinda a wimp, where he is a pretty cool cat with the best catch lines ever in the rest of the series. The Glory also thought that the tree rape scene was kinda unnecessary..but pretty damn cool. Evil Dead kinda set the standard for the following Sam Raimi movies. The darkness ever present beneath the surface..or in the woods. The Glory watched this movie a long time after she first watched Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness and thought that it was pretty neat to see the way the whole thing started. In fact, The Glory would suggest seeing the movies in that order. The Glory highly suggests this movie as a part of any fun movie night with friends.
