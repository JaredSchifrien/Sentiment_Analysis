 This is a film lovers dream.Filled with nothing but great,professional performances by the entire cast,a beautiful score,master direction and not to mention one of the best if not the best mystery/suspence stories ever put to film. Kevin Spacy stands out with his Oscar winning portrayl of Verbal the crippled criminal. In this movie nothing is as it seems.You get just about everything action,suspense,comedy,mystery,drama. This is one of my favorite films and I garuntee you will love this film. Not a money back garuntee mind you. I don't work at a video store.
