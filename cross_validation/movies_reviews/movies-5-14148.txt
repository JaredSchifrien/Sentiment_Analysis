An incredibly powerful and intense movie. It reminded me of American History X with the atmosphere and mood of the story and its setting. The characters are all wonderfully developed, and the movie is very interesting all the way through. Hillary Swank was Oscar-material with her amazing performance in this film. It is a very emotional TRUE story, and was well worth watching. Highly reccomended!
