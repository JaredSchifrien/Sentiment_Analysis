Gets better every time I seeit. Only movie where I can tolerate Mia Farrow. Her line what have you done with his eyes? haunts me for some reason. I love the is she paranoid? are they a coven? are they plotting against her? is she just mental? is the pregnancy affecting her? is she having a crisis of faith? is marriage really worth it? how much should we know our neighbors? how much should we question our doctors? do some people succeed in life and others fail because of a secret covenant? is religion nothing more than an approved form of a secret society? what is a woman's worth? and the greatest question, never answered, does a mother know when she's raising a horror, and how far will she go to protect it? The last question is the most profound one for me that this movie asks. The movie is chock full of images, dialogue, and symbols that question all these things. I like how Polanski integrated the seasons and NY into the plot - the seasonal thing is so subtle u don't realize it spans 9 months. An all-time great. Much, much richer and deeper than simply a horror movie.
