Okay I love horror movies but this movie was really bad. How many times can a movie repeat the whole scream killer sequence. Every killer has to have this long reason on how they kill but none of it makes sense now. Scream is a great movie!! urban legend was alright but what the hell were they thinking making a sequel. I wanna laugh in the face of the director because it is so bad the only person who saves it is the kid that is in me, myself and irene and is the effects maker in the movie. Oh before I forget Pam Grier woman cop I love you!! This is an insult to all horror fans and an insult to all movie-goers.
