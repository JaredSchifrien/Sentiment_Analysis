A mentally ill creep passes judgement on children in this creepy movie. The fat kid is despised and reviled simply for enjoying chocolate. He never even gets a chance to show his personality because he's the first to go. The singers call him disgusting and repulsive. No wonder fat kids at school have double the rate of suicide attempts! Why is it ok to hurt fat kids?
