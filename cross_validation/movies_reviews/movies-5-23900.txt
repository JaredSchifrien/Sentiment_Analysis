One of my favorite movies. Maybe it's my love for Greek mythology that helps me like it more but I like everything about it. I can't think of anyone besides Brad Pitt who could play Achillies, Orlando Bloom did ok as Paris. Peter O'Toole is excellent as Priam, Brian Cox was so good at playing the evil Agamemond and Eric Bana was fabulous as Hector, he really knew how to spout those powerful lines. I do have a compalint in that I wish there was some more background on the story of Achillies. But overall, it's a solid flick.
