An extraordinary film about the destructive force that one simple lie can yield in poisoning friendships, ruining careers and destroying lives [PROGRAM NOTE: This 1961 classic will be shown twice next month, April 2005, on the Turner Classic Movies channel]. Although it is a sobering account and at times, somewhat heavy-handed, few films I've seen in recent yrs pack the wallap this one does. Highly recommended.
