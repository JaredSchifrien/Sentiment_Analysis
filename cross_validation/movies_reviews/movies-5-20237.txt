Alright, this movie was awesome. Unfortunately, so many people are not gonna get it, hardly anyone will watch it. You have to truly watch the movie with an open mind, and pay attention to make it make sense. The acting was good, the story was well thought out and unusual. Definitely a unique witchcraft movie. If you are looking for a movie to watch late at night, this is it.
