Simply put, Bowling for Columbine is a disaster of a movie. I thought it would be at least somewhat thought-provoking, and instead I found it disjointed, uninspiring, and too slanted to be taken seriously. The movie jumped around from one issue to another with such a heavy hand that it seemed like a joke (and perhaps it was). Michael Moore's interactions along the way were extremely annoying, and I kept asking myself why he didn't ask more intelligent questions. He certainly had some interesting ideas to work with. To top it off, the movie seemed to go on forever. When I see how much acclaim this movie received, I'm baffled. Perhaps it's the Emperor's-New-Clothes phenomenon...
