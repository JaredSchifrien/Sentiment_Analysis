oh my god. as if the first sequel wasn't bad enough, they had to make another scream movie.. oh well, what can you do, right? a couple of good things though. they brought randy back(even if it was in a video) and it was nice to see jay and silent bob, but that was about it. not keeping with the scream tradition, there was only one killer who turned out to be a character whom wich we knew absolutely nothing about and was only introduced to us once. i mean, it could have been anyone, the pissed off brother or john q. walk-on. another thing, where did everyone get those bullet proof vests?a cute attempt to try and finish off the scream movies, but sorry guys, you failed miserably.
