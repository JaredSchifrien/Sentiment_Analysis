wow. an amazing movie which touchs on the human race and its moronic self-destructive ways. less civil than damn apes. i had the extreme displeasure of seeing this movie more or less back to back with the new one (with makers mark.) its saddening how foul the movie industry has turned. really. saddening. i dont understand. i still have some hope. but then again, with all the morons around...i doubt it.
