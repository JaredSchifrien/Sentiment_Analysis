Depicting a Japanese architect's affair (at Hiroshima,in 1959) with a French actress, who recalls her wartime love for a German soldier under Nazi occupation,this is a ground-breaking,and highly influential arthouse masterpiece.Its intertwining of past and present,and of different personal and political experiences, is handled with rare sensitivity, elegance and wholly cinematic expertise.A challenging but refined,quietly moving and brilliant film.
