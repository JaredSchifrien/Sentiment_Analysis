not as good as Pulp Fiction but thats an unfair compaison. Kill Bill has an amazing story line and has many original parts(anime and the black and white fighting scenes). I understand that the blood seemed fake but thats missing the point of the movie. For those who love blood and guts, HIGHLY RECOMMENED
