Do movies reflect the personalities of people who make them? If so, Michael Bay (Director) and Jerry Bruckheimer (Producer) must have no personalities at all. The characters are only self interested and shallow while the actual bombing of Pearl Harbor seemed like it's only purpose was to mess up that little love triangle between the only three characters in the movie. What a bunch of saps.
