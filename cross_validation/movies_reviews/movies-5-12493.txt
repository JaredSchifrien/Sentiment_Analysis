Nowadays, people don't seem to understand the word TALENT!!! (Singing, Dancing, Costumes, Settings A++++) The Phantom of the Opera is an excellent movie that was well written and composed in an excellent fashion. Not only was the plot interesting but the settings were very beautiful and the music was spectacular. Whether you enjoy classical music or not surely you can appreciate the effort that was put into this film. The amount of practice that went into composing and performing these pieces is incredible and you can tell it in the actors and actresses appearance on the set. It is a sweet love story filled with much passion. GREAT TALENT - I kid you not, these people can actually sing unlike a lot of people in today's society.
