Not just a film for kids. This one can be enjoyed by all ages. It's fairly faithful to the original story, and the actors are all wonderful in their roles and most importantly, they all look like they are having a great time. The special effects are wonderful too. They not only look realistic, but they also serve the story instead of overshadow it. And the deal about satanism--forget it. It's not there.
