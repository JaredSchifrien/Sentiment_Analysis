First let me get a few random words of advice out of the way: 1) Don't see this movie on a first date, 2) Don't eat dinner while watching this movie, and 3) Don't see this movie expecting to feel good afterwards. Requiem for a Dream is one of the most disturbing movies I've seen. Everything about it makes you uncomfortable - the downward spiral of each character, the relentless music, the jagged filming and editing techniques... everything. The acting performances are universally excellent. Ellen Burstyn, especially, gives an amazing performance as the lonely widow and mother who falls victim to a diet pill addiction. This is clearly not a movie for everyone, but it's hard to give such an unconventional, powerful film anything less than five stars.
