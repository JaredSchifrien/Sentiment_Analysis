Had it been a bunch of B-movie hacks, maybe I would give it 2 stars. But considering that it had the Coen brothers, Steven Soderburgh, and Tom Hanks involved, this movie squandered all that star power in a very unfunny mess. Very few laughs. And all Marlon Wayans did was launch lines like, F--- the f---ing mother f---er, you mother f---er. After a while, it gets on your nerves. You know, I wouldn't find that funny, even if I was a juvenile delinquent in the hood. My wife was turned off, and a complained, Can we turn this off, before dozing off about a third through the movie. Tom Hanks was miscast and was probably his worst role since Bosom Buddies. An absolute waste of time. After stinkers like this and Intolerable Cruelty, maybe the Coen brothers simply suck.
