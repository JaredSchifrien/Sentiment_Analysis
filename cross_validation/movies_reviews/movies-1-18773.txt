I have a question about this movie: The whole thing is that if you make a copy of the tape, you wont die. (it was discovered at the end). Rachel made a copy of the tape at the begining of the movie, but why through out the entire movie Rachel is having all these symptoms and signs as if she was going to die? (Bloody noses, blurry picture, hair coming out of her throat etc.)It's hard for me to watch this movie thinking that.
