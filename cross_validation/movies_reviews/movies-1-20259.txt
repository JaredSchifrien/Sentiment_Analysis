Stupid. Illogical. A Dracula that at one point can't be killed by the sunlight but then later he can? Very illogical. Very predictable. Gerard Butler was nice to look at, but that's about it. To the movie's credit it did base around the little know Judeo-Christian theory of Dracula's Origin, and explains several things associated with Dracula (stake through the heart, silver, etc). However, it wasn't scary or suspensful and was actually very stupid. Dracula in New Orleans, please. It is no wonder most of the actors in this film havent' worked since this disaster.
