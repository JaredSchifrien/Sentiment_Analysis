Another bulls-eye for Pixar. One of the few movies that is great for all ages and yet doesn't fall into the trap of being too childish. A retired super hero aches to break out of the run-of-the-mill family man role and go back to his glory days, and he gets it. And so does the rest of the family. Excellent animation, cute storyline; I can't think of a bad thing about it.
