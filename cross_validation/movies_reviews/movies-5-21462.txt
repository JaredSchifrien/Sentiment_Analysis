Excellent sci-fi drama! Although Lucas borrowed heavily from a number of different Toho/Kurosawa films, he put together the ideas to make something truly astonishing. Although I consider Empire Strikes Back to be the best in the entire series, Star Wars would have to come in close second. And besides, any of the Star Wars movies is FAR better than The Matrix!
