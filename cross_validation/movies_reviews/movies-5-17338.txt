A truly passionate and beautifully done film about a woman trying to help others by sacrificing her own needs and going out of her way to do it. Amelie is a truly unique character, with her quirks and flaws and trademarks and she's had a hard life. Her mother was killed in front of her and she had to give away her pet goldfish at such a young age under brutal enforcement of her mother. But Amelie finds joy in every little thing about life. A uplifting film.
