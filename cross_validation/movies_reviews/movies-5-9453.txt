incredible witty and wonderful. even more a joy if you know these types b/c then it becomes dead on parody. a well-written adaption. i was worried b/c i enjoyed the Hornby novel(back when he was still writing amusing novels), but the film translated perfectly for the american audience and Cusack handled Rob Gordon with comedic grace.
