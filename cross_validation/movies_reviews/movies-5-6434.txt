My all time favorite movie. Did anyone notice Plastic Jesus playing during Carrie Fischer's seen in the latest Kevin Smith Film. One of the greatest scripts ever written. I guarantee you've heard someone quote the failure to communicate line in the last week. Mellencamp quotes Luke on the track Scarecrow. Guns N' Roses uses a byte from it to open Civil War. Ronald Reagen quoted it during the State of the Union Address. Ethan Hawk quotes it in Reality Bites. Hey guys, how many times have you seen one of those sexy scenes of a gorgeous woman washing a car seductively (Liv Tyler was a recent one)? You've got this film to thank for it! Oh, anything that sweet has just got to be named Lucille. One of the greatest things about this film is the fact that it leaves it to the viewer to decide for themselves exactly what the details of Luke's life are. The parking meter tells you everything you need to know about him in the first shot. Also, the two speaches to God are two of the greatest ever filmed. *****+
