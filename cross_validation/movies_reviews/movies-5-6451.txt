Not bad for a movie they stole from the Japanese. Originally based on a Japanese film called SEVEN SAMURI, the MAGNIFICENT SEVEN tells the tail of seven hired guns who chase the bad guys away from a mexican town. A better western would be hard to find. From the inspiring music of the opening credits, to the last bullet falss, it's high adventure all the way. Not only one of the best westerns ever made, it's one of the best movies ever made. Unfortunatly, they made some pretty dismal sequeals, but the original still stands as a great movie. I watch it nearly every time it is shown on the tube, which ain't often enough!
