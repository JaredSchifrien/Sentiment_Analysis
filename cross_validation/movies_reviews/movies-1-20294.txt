I think this is beyond all bounds the worst of the Child Play franchise. The only frightning moments in this peice were the parts that had people trying to act and the horrible dialogue is spoken. The low production costs and crap idea make this one of the worst Child's Play movies and one of the worst horror films ever made. Complete poo.
