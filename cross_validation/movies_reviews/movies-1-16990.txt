A good Sci-Fi movie. I grow tired of people constantly focusing on the sex scene & forgetting about how badly the main characters treated their children. The sex scene was very sloppy & Hallie looked drugged up in ecstasy which is something I never expected her look like. This woman harbours such tremendous hypocrisy when she states Hollywood is racist when she turns around & protrays some poor needy black woman who is willing to sleep with a racist. My God where is the bottom & I am glad her mom is white.
