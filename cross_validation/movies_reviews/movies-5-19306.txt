This film has the spooky camp feel like part one, which is what I love in a Friday the 13th film. Not only is it a fun movie to watch but it features a hot chick with a perfect butt! You guys that have seen the movie,you know what I'm talking about. I like the way Jasons face looks at the end of the movie, the whole deformed wild man in the woods is really beliveable and scary. Watch out for the skinny goofy looking guy named Ted, this guys funny just to look at. He does some fuuny sh*t in the bar scene! Best to watch this film if your drunk or high on we*d! Two thumbs up!
