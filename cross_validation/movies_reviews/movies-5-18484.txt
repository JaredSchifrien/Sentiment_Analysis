I'm not a big fan of this sub-genre created by Hitchcock (This is, in no way an attack on Hitchcock, mind you) but along with it's sequel Halloween, I can make a exception. Wes Craven has definately created something entertaining and, at the same time, very good. And yet, he wasn't done. He came out with a sequel that was alot better!
