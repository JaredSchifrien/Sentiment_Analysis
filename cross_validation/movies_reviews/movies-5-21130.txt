High Society is a wonderful musical. In some ways it can be said to be the perfect convergence of those revolutionary talents who dominated American popular music in the first half of the twentieth century. Louis Armstrong was perhaps the dominant force in defining American music. His sense of rhythm and genius for improvisation left its indelible mark on jazz and jazz has left its mark on every other type of modern music. Bing Crosby is perhaps the most underrated musician of the twentieth century. He, along with Armstrong and Ethel Waters, invented the modern singing style. If you doubt that, listen to those who were big stars before Bing, people like Rudy Vallee or Al Jolson, and then listen to Bing. Nothing was ever the same after him. And nothing needs to be said about the talent of Frank Sinatra. There are two numbers in particular that stand out. Crosby and Armstrong sing Now You Has Jazz and Crosby and Sinatra sing Well Did You Evah? . Each is practically a tutorial on how tremendously gifted people with somewhat varied talents can use those talents to complement one another and create a true work of art in the process. It is sublime. The movie also boasts a witty, Cole Porter score and the beauty of Grace Kelly. It is well worth seeing
