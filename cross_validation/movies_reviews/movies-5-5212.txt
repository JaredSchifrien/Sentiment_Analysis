I loved the show that the movie was based on and I never dreamed any one would do alive action version. Well they did and the effects are very nice the story is a little week and concentrates on the kids a little to much. Bill Paxton and Anthony Edwards make their money easy as does Ben Kingsly. You have to look at the film incontext, it is based on a 1960s kid show which was great for its time. The original producers and creators where left out of the project. I think they could have done a lot better but it was a very good effort. Great family movie and fun to watch for everyone. Unfortunatly the critics are beating it up and alot of people will not see it. If you get to the movie late don't worry the begining credits are horrible.
