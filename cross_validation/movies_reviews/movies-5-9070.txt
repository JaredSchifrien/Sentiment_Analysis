I'm a huge fan of this movie (not physically huge like Chris Farley, but you know what I mean, right?). There's a 15 minute stretch in the middle of it, winding up with Farley/Spade crying while singing along to Superstar (by the Carpenters), which is as good as any comedy I can think of. Chris Farley will definitely be missed.
