Amazing movie. Sustains an almost unbearable level of tension the entire running time.This was the first movie for a lot of people: Eric Red, who wrote and directed, the cinematographer, whose name slips my mind, Mark Isham, the composer. Rutger Hauer is flawless in the title role. C. Thomas Howell is just good, but the story and direction are so strong, it doesn't matter. At first glance, the movie is a simple thriller, but it's really about the master/apprentice, father/son relationship. Never seen that done in a thriller.
