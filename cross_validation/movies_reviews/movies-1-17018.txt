Gross, sick, disgusting, no purpose and defiantely not worth the money to see or hire. Sure it has the great actor Christian Bale, but it doesn't do anything for the audience. It is also at most points confusing and u get mixed up with what is real and unreal. A bit of weird, gross movie that isn't worth a look. Just read the title American Psycho
