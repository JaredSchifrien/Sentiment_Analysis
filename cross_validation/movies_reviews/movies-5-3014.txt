To say that Equilibrium was under-marketed is an understatement and then some. This film is above and beyond the best of the countless attempts to paint a picture of a nightmarish, fascist future hell. It borrows from a variety of sources, but still manages to throw all of its influences into a work that is truly greater than the sum of its parts. The Prozium is a modernized version of the Soma from Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, the burning of all art is reminiscent of Fahrenheit 451, and the constant fear of being reported to the authorities for feeling is taken directly from George Orwell's 1984. But perhaps the best way to describe Equilibrium is to mix Brave New World, 1984, and Fahrenheit 451 with Bladerunner and The Matrix. But still, Equilibrium manages to make all these elements its own, making this film a must see. Besides, Christian Bale is the man. American Psycho, anyone?
