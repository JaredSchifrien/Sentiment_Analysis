 Tremendous! This all tapping, ballet and jazz film is great and a must-see for all dance lovers. Gene Kelly, Iam proud to say is the greatest dancer in the entire world, a cute one too and a great singer at that also. Also starring Debbie Reynolds (mother of Princess Leia or more appropriately Carrie Fischer) is beautiful and amazing, considering she did not dance until this movie (Gene Kelly taught her for the movie). It's a fun-loving, tap, crazy film with romance and humour (especially from COSMO ). Go and c now!
