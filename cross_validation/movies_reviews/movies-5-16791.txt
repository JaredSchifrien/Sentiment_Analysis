this sleeper hit breaks your heart, but not in the way you expect it to. stick with it to its conclusion, and get your guts twisted into a pretzel. beautifully shot with an excellent score. fine cast, good script. a bit frustrating, but anything that affects you is good in the cinema. strongly recommended.
