Very good indeed. It was not only a wonderful story, with more than the one simple hollywood-trick, it was composed in a way that gave harmony to it. Clear shots and clean colours... I felt good watching it. Of course, it was terribly sad.And at the time of watching it, I would not have wanted the Li Mu Bai story to end in that fashion, but I suppose the movie would not have been as good if it hadn't. A good film, because every time I see it, I notice new things.
