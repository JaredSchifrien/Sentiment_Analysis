Excellent. Bonnie and Clyde is a movie set in the depression era where the two main characters, Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) and Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway), rob banks amdist the dreariness and despair of the 1930s. Wanting to escape her job as a waitress in a cafe, Bonnie teams up with Clyde and together they become a crime duo. Along the way, Clyde and Bonnie adds a gas bar attendant and Clyde's brother Buck and his wife Blanche to their crime team. Not really intending to harm or kill anyone, their crime spree takes a violent turn when they become wanted for murdering a bank clerk in a botched robbery. Bonnie and Clyde are then not only wanted robbers on the run but are wanted murderers as well. There's lots of shooting and I found the conlusion to be jolting and unexpected. Bonnie and Clyde is truly a classic as it gives viewers some insight into the desperation experienced by those who lived throughout the great depression and what some people were willing to do to escape it.
