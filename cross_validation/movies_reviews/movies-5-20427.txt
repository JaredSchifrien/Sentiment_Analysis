this movies was amazing. sorry kids, but this is no teenie bopper horror flick with jenifer love hewitt, this is accually a thought provoking movie. is the blair witch realy behind the murders, or was the tour group just in mass hysteria? that is the question brought up here. i think that this movie tackles the issue of the dangers in believing in movies, the dangers of blurring the lines between fiction and reality. i thought the movie had great ensamble cast of young actors who hadn't been revealed yet, and the movie was very well directed although i watched the movie with commentary by joe berlinger and i wish the studio hadn't messed with it, but even through that it was an unbelievable movie. this movie is creepy as hell too, not while your watching, but when you go home and start thinking of all the freaky stuff that manifested itself throughout the movie. i really admire joe for tackling the sequel at a completely different angle than the original. i think this movie only did bad because people wanted it to. i recomend that those who have not seen it, see it, and for those who hated it, give it another chance through my perspective.
