Munson, I certainly agree with you. Kramer vs. Kramer is a wonderfully touching film, and Justin Henry as the seven year old involved in a custody battle, is brilliant. I think this is one of Hoffman's best films as well. The way his and Meryl Streep's characters are shown as mostly vindictive toward the other, but with an underlying compassion as well as thinking of the child, adds substance to the story. I applaud Kramer vs. Kramer for depicting divorce through a child's eyes so well, that surely even the more hardened of hearts will be affected by it. The best motion pictures do more than merely entertain; they enlighten. Bravo!
