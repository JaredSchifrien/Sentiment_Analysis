Dawn of the Dead is the crown jewel of George Romero's 'Dead' trilogy. Whereas Night of the Living Dead was a fun, campy and almost comical flick, Dawn of the Dead is much more insidious. Unlike NOLD, where the story is more or less confined to those trapped in the farmhouse, in Dawn we see the Zombie plague - and accompanying panic - spread like wildfire across the country in the first few scenes. From there, Dawn takes viewers on a journey where the main characters seek refuge from the flesh eating rampage in a deserted shopping mall. The characters attempt to ward off intrusion from the flesh eating monsters by building barracades but eventually lose when an army of looters targets their fortress and blasts open the entrances. Dawn has it's share of gore and special effects although I find it to be more of a thriller type movie than a pure horror flick. Well done! Dawn of the Dead remains one of my favourite movies of all time.
