The Matrix was a great movie that captured the audience's attention for the whole two hours with amazing special effects and an incredible story. I saw this movie four times in the theater because the action was just so great. Keanu Reeves was perfect as Neo, and I found myself feeling just as he felt as he discovered things. Overall, I think this was one of the best movies made last year.
