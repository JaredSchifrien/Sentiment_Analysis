A film that consistently brings tears to my eyes. Frank Capra's masterpiece of ethics, the American Dream, and George Bailey's search for fame and discovery that a man doesn't have to be wealthy to be the richest man in town is an American classic that has become such a part of our lives that Christmas without this film is like bacon without eggs. Includes the performance that defines Jimmy Stewart's unparalleled movie career, some of the most memorable scenes in history, and Lionel Barrymore as Mr. that man has been a boil on my neck for 20 years Potter. See it every year.
