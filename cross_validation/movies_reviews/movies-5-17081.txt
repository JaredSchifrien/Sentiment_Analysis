I've heard comments from people who said this is a bad movie because there was no chemistry between Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, and I'd like to say to them THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT. If Cruise and Kidman's characters were happy enough or satisfied with their relationship, do you think they would have fantasized about having affairs? NO!!! There was no chemistry because the movie would then mean nothing. Be a little open-minded folks. Also, this film was written, produced, and directed by the late, great Stanley Kubrick. Show it some respect.
