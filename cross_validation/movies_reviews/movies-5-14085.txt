While I would not bother seeing any of Kevin Costner's recent movies, Field of Dreams, is a timeless story that I would watch anytime. It showcases the heartwarming spirit associated with baseball. I got shivers when 'Shoeless Joe Jackson' emerged from Costner's cornfields. This should easily be America's favorite movie about America's favorite pasttime.
