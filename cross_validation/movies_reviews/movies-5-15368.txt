This movie personally for me has to be one of the best movies aimed at the teenage market. A lot of the times we see teenage movies using the virtue of teenage agnst as an excuse to start treating teenagers as idiots or trying to instill a patronising life theme. They go from one extreme to another, no spectrum in-between. Teenagers are not idiots their young adults and the more films that stopped trying to depict them as idiots or patronising them the more they would be appreciated. The themes used in this film: teenage mother (Derricks sister), inter-racial relationships (Derrick and Julie), dreams coming true (Julie trying to get into Julliard), coping with death at a young age and peer pressure are all too real. This film used it in a very tasteful and realistic manner. Bravo!!
