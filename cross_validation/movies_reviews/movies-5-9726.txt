MASH the movie was very good. The tv show was pretty good, but i think the movie and its ability to display things they couldnt show on tv give it a much bigger punch. As a movie, MASH is just one of those movies which will always be harmed, ratings-wise, by the political message it carried. I love the humor and the story of this movie and love to see it every time I can find it.
