Sean Connery plays a desert bandit who kidnaps an American Widow and her two kids. It is 1904. Brian Keith plays a great Teddy Roosevelt who sends the marines. They land and shoot up the ruler's palace, hold him for ransom and get back the Americans. It is loosely based on history but really great fun in the main. The scenes between Candace Bergen and Connerty sometimes get a little draggy, but you can fast forward past those.
