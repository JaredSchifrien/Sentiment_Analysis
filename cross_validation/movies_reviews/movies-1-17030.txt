Based on Brett Easton's equally absurd book, this turkey belongs in the elite class of films like Ishtar, Heaven's Gate, Hudson Hawk etc. Granted, it does accurately portray the greedy, power-hungry, self-centered, Stepford Wife mentality of the 80's yuppie, wall street crowd, but everything else is pathetic. Christian Bale was too old for the lead role and his acting was beyond terrible. Willem Dafoe and the great Reese Witherspoon, were wasted in their small roles. The book failed miserably at it's attempt to get real deep and psychological so the movie tries even harder and fails even worse. The did he or didn't he angle was a great idea but neither the author nor the director had the talent to pull it off. Then, to make it even worse, the director tried to make it look 'artsy'...PUH-LEASE !!... I think every copy of this pitiful movie should be burned. What a waste of time and effort.
