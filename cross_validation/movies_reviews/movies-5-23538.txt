Just as exciting and entertaining as the first film. Spider-Man 2 definitely lived up to the first film, and in many ways surpassed it (especially in mixing drama and comedy). The Spider-Man films do not seem to be going downhill in quality like so many previous superhero sagas have. Let's hope that the upcoming addition to the series keeps it that way.
