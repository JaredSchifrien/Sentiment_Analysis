What confuses me is why this is in the action section when it should be in the horror section? Strange. Anyways, this has got to be one of the best horror tales ever made for the screen! Foster Hopkins are excellent as is Demme's direction. The atmosphere is good, the tension is unbearable and all of it's praise is well-deserved. Excellent movie!
