I love this movie. The main reason why I love this movie is because you get to see Paul Walker's bare naked booty. SIGN ME UP! But other than that, it also was very suspensful and it kept me at the edge of my seat. I think I had a couple of nightmares. It really scared me at the end, when the guy's voice came on the radio. I thought they would have a Joy Ride 2. I hope so!
