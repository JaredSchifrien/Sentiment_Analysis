Now this is a true funny movie. I think that it started off rather slow and a litte boring but once Drew Barrymore came into the movie it became alot more exciting. Of course I think many people will agree with me that the penguin was easily the best character out there. I think the funniest part of the whole movie is when it showed Adam Sandler alone crying on the ship singing the Beach Boys Song. This is definetly one of those must see movies. I could watch it every day all day long. Made me laugh harder than Shrek 2, Garfeild, and Dodgeball all put together. GREAT ending!!!
