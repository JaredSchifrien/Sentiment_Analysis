another scary film personally i've found haunted house movies to be scariest if their done well and this ones the best in the tradition of amityville horror and burnt offerings two previous good but dated haunted house flims. this is the best though. i mean even the little girl was scary for some reason. i couldn't watch this movie even in my teen years and didn't view until i was well into my 20's. still don't care much for sleeping in bedrooms/living rooms at night with t.v. sets. nuff said.
