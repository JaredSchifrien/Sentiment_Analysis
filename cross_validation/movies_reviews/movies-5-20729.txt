Just to start this comment off, I'd like to say that I absolutely LOVE Audrey Hepburn. Once again she had an amazing performance. My Fair Lady is an older film that is a blend of romance, comedy and a little bit of drama. It is a very long movie, 2 movies, in fact, but it goes really quick because it's such an enjoyable movie. To really give you an understanding of how much I liked it. I saw this movie in the 6th grade even and I felt this way aobut it then also.
