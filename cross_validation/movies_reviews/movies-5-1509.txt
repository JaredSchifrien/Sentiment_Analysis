I think this movie is the greatest movie of all time. I saw it when I was 10 and fell in love with it. It shows a guy and his girlfriend get brutally murdered by greasy thugs. Eric Draven gets his revenge all of of them when the crow brings him back. I also believe that if Brandon Lee's life hadn't been cut short he would have been a huge star. RIP Brandon
