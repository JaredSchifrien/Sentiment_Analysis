The entire Lord of the Rings trilogy is just so amazing that it's hard to describe. But the Return of the King is so amazing, it's *impossible* to describe! This movie is something grand to behold from start to finish. The costumes, the sweeping camera, the lush landscapes, everything is just superb! Although, what really makes this movie is the characters. We've watched them through this long journey and now here it is ... what ultimatly becomes of our beloved characters! It is so heartfelt and moving, I must have cried 15 times throughout!! And what an amazing beautiful cast of actors and actresses! Very very very good! The Return of the King feels like less of a movie and more like magic. Or Movie Magic as they say! :)
