I absolutely love Brian DePalma's directing. I also liked it because it wasn't all about the action scene. It was about backstabs and meticuously laid out plans that worked to a tee. It also was a good spy movie that wasn't like Bond. Bond is good, but there is only one Bond, not to be imitated, and the writers of this movie obviously recognized that. Now the second one, I couldn't tell if I was watching M:I2 or a new Bond movie.
