This movie was so disappointing. First, it was not believeable at all. The sequence of events and the characters reactions to the events were contrived. Also, the movie glorifies police brutality, which is particularly disturbing as John Singleton directed it. Also, Latinos are stereotyped as drug lords. All in all, the movie was quite offensive.
