In the day of AIDS, the internet, and phone sex, the club scene has seemed to plummet in the past decade, but Swingers was just the film to revive it! A film about male camraderie, Swingers drills holes into some of our accepted stereotypes of men while reaffirming other ones. The heartsick,sensitive Mikey, the down-to-earth sensible Rob, the too cool for words Trent, and his quick-tempered partner in crime, Sue, not only serve as the main characters in this film, but as stereoypes that have been generated since the dawn of cinema. What is so wonderful about Favreau's script is that he gives us moments where the actors can stop being their characters and start being human ie. Big T standing on the table in the diner and Mikey ranting about going to clubs. Those are the moments when the female preconceived notions of men start breaking down and the ideal of men as real, thinking people start replacing them. I can't think of a better comedy for Gen-Xers, men and women, to see together. It would give women a chance to ask questions and men a chance to explain.
