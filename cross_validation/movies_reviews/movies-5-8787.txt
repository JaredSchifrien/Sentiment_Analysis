This movie is a social psycologist's dream! The acting was terrific, right on target, and together with a great screenplay you have a top-notch movie. Christopher Guest is brilliant and this movie deserved far more attention than it received. It will become a cult classic, much like Spinal Tap and the Monty Python movies. If you like movies about real people, this is your movie.
