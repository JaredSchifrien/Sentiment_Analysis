Great movie. I am a Tolkien. What I love about the book was how detailed it was, how complex. Could the mopvies capture that, no. So why try. Or why, for that matter try and hold true. Instead Peter Jackson held true in a different way. He held true to the themes, and the story itself. The emotions, the places, what made Middle Earth. And the book is confusing, watching the movie can really help clarify it too. The sets and the music and the characters looked to me correct. And unlike that horrendous animated film (true to the book in it's own way) the prounounciations are correct. The animated film messed up the names, had Celeborn pronounced Seleborn, and wouldn't even dare put the amount of elvish and such that was in these movies. Good job there. They seemed toc are about keeping the characters looking the way they should, so to speak. They put little details in, some which made sense only to the fans. peter Jackson did a good job. In general (especially in the first one) he did a good job of knowing what to take out, and what to leave it, making the difficult choices. All in all he suceeded at keeping the balance.
