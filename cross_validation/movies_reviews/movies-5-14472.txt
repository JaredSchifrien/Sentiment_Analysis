I really got into 'Almost Fanous'. This movie really took me back..! Tells it like it is in the music scene even today. I was there in Hollywood during the Jim Morrison and DOORS episode is my point. As well as I was there in person when Grace Slick and The Jefferson Airplane performed their first public performance at the Long Shoreman's Hall in S.F. (The Greatful Dead appeared on the same night, later) Really an enjoyable flick..!
