Pesky ewoks notwithstanding, this is still one fine movie. It ties up all the story threads from the first two to make a perfect type ending. Of course the special effects are superb, but unlike many movies since, they don't drown the story. They enhance it. And those who think this is just another sci-fi movie are totally wrong. This is about family, this is about the battle of good and evil/right and wrong. It is also a story of redemption and coming of age. The climactic battle between Vader and Luke is one of my all time favorite movie scenes.
