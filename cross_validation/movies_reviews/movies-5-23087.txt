It's Star Wars! Phantom Menace could've been Jar Jar Binks humming the theme from Love Boat for 2 hours and I still would've given it a 5. I don't know a single person that only paid to see Phantom Menace once. Most paid to see it 3-7 times. I myself would never reveal how many times I paid to see it in the theater, because I'd be setting myself up as the biggest loser on earth. Let's just say I saw it in the theater somewhere between 1 and 26 times. Do the math yourself.
