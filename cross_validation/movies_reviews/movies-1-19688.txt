I like mindless FUN action movies but this movie wasn't fun..it was just minldess and boring. The plot is ridiculous, the CGI was overused and the action and sound was so mind numbingly relentless I was hoping for some truly scary parts but none came, the charcters are flat and unintersting and the dialogue is terrible So you're the great Van Helsing says Dr.Jekyl and Mr.Hyde And you're a deranged psycho says Van Helsing ...good comeback. The ending was so disappointing, after the movie was finished I felt nothing, just like I had wasted my money to see a bunch of minldess overdone action pieces and CGI. I like mindless action but I atleast deserve characters that I have some care about and a plot a little less ridiculous. Rental only...discount rental.
