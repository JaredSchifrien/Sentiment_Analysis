One of the greatest dramas ever filmed.Asuperb cast,fantastic story and great score.Alec Guiness as the crazed British Colonel intent on showing British superiority over his captors by building a bridge that will harm the British war effort carries this movie.Playing an American who escaped from the camp,William Holden, turns in a stirling performance as the man who must destroy the bridge.A true masterpiece.
