This is a funny movie. The Nick Dundee is funny yet fits the real typical stereotype of an Australian. It was funny how Nick was just as skillful in the city in his own way as he was in the bush. The only problem is that if you think Australians are all like Nick Dundee and all yobos, you have another thing coming.
