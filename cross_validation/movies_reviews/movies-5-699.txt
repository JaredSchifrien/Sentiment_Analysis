By far one of the best movies made from a tv show. The movie is powerful, riveting and a great action adventure film. Harrison Ford is terrific as Dr Richard Kimble a man accussed of murdering his wife. Tommy Lee Jones was perfect as Sam Gerard the U.S Marshall who took his job seriously and put out all stops to find Kimble. The movie hooks you from the beginning and doesn't let go.
