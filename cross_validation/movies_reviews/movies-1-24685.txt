Ugh! The premise of this movie is compelling..the invisible man..blah blah blah. However, Hollow Man just doesn't cut it. The special effects are sometimes impressive, but the content (plot, acting, etc..) are as invisible as Kevin Bacon. As the plot lessens, so does the clothing on the women in the movie. I guess they decided to rely on gratuitous boob shots rather than put some actual thought into the making of this movie. I will admit that there were some (few) suspenseful moments..but about halfway through (if not sooner) the movie becomes so predictable and the ending is so over the top it is ridiculous. Don't waste your money or 2 hours of your life on this bomb.
