Best movie I've seen in a while. A gripping story, beautifully shot and directed. The acting is superb, and the fight scenes are magical in every sense. There's so much depth to this film, it's hard to know where to start -- it's far more than just a martial arts movie, though the martial arts part of it is pretty fantastic.
