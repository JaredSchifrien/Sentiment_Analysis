This is one of the most powerful movies of all-time. More importantly, it is one of the most important movies of all-time. Amazingly, there are still people who deny that the Holocaust ever happened. And, each year, there are fewer and fewer people still alive who survived the Nazi concentration camps. This movie is a reminder of the atrocities (and it really doesn't matter if Oskar Schindler really wasn't the hero that he was portrayed to be). It keeps the tragedy in the public conciousness and reminds us to never let something like this happen again. Sure, it is quite long and people have shied away because of the intense subject matter. Nevertheless, if you have never seen it, you have an obligation to the millions who died to do so.
