After talking over this movie with friends, I find that you'll either find this movie kinda strange, or you'll find it with that certain unexplicable-type feeling that only you understand. I find the movie a wonderful conception of a world with a reality twisted only enough to make a difference, but not enough to make a significant leap in viewpoint. The best movie ever made, watch it alone.
