UPDATE: Say goodbye to America, hope you enjoy your police state? Facts are facts? Reav, whew. Now, there are lots of things you can blame on a public high school education, but your kool-aid distribution seems a little more serious. Moore's movie is factual? Even the faithful Deaniacs don't try to purport that. Just line up in Michael's kool-aid line when he tells you it's a fact that it's good for you. I'll remain in the police state I just voted for. And bluetar, being propaganda doesn't make it false? Look up the definition of propaganda again. ORIGINAL COMMENT 3/4/05: This is on the wrong list. Where is the list on crockumentaries? This rates a 5 there.
