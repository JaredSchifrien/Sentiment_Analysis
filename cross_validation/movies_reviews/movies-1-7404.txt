Although it has one or 2 amusing moments, it again turns too raunchy for its own good and has distatesful visual gags, too many sex jokes and too much profanity. About the only light are the occasionally-amusing parents, who swim in and out of tasteful and yucky. The acting is still sub-par, except for the father, and the plot is innane. Avoid this movie!
