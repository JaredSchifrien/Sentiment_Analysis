A movie that probably could not be made today, this is arguably one of the finest pieces of American cinema. I don't feel that I'm exagerrating. From subtle lines to the most offensive gags ( More beans, Mr. Taggart? ), Blazing Saddles never tries to be anything it's not and comes out being so much more; a real reflection of Amercan society and humor in the mid 20th century. I recently watched this film with some college-aged people (18-22) and, sadly, having grown up with political correctness, sound bites, and slapstick-only humor, the really genius moments were lost to them. Examples, The sherrif's a n-(church bell), ...my mother is Dutch! and even, It's twoo, it's twoo! These poor kids just didn't get it. Needless to say, the fart scene was a big hit. If your life experiences have taken you beyond your television, watch this movie. But if that's the case, chances are you already have.
