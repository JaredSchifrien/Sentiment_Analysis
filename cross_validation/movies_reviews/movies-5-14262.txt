An incredible movie that came at a time when we needed it most. Tom Hanks is moving and quite amazing as the lawyer afflicted with AIDS and Denzel Washington becomes the homophobic lawyer who takes on the case. Not only does Philadelphia explore the professional prejudice against AIDS victims, it brings us into the personal world..the human side. A very touching movie and sometimes difficult to watch. I specifically remember the scene after the costume party (Washington is trying to discuss the case as Hanks sings and translates the aria) An effective scene. If I have to explain that, it was lost on you. A must see.
