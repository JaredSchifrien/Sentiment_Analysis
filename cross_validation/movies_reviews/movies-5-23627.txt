This ionly goes to prove how good an actor Chuckie Heston really is. A poor script and the bad acting by others (not including Edward G.!), and a thin plot line, and yet he shines brilliantly. LIke in a lot of his flicks, he dies a memorable and believable death in this one, too. IJR says check it out!
