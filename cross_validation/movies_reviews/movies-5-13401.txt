its a great movie. tom hanks is so believable that you are beginning to think that the script or maybe the original novel was written with him in mind. director robert zemeckis pulled out all stops for crafting a superb film. robin wright was excellent, and so was computer enhanced gary sinise. this movie by the way has more special effects than the final part of star wars trilogy the return of jedi. all thanks to people in LucasArt, whose magic is woven seamlessly into the movie. its not just a space opera or fantasy flick. its one of those movies where S/FX are mutating out reality. but anyways, i think forrest gump is a great movie.
