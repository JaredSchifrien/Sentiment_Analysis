An absolutely marvelous film and one of the few sequels which lived up to the original. The movie is divided into two parts and the action goes back and forth between the two. One part tells the story of a young Vito Corleone, wonderfully played by Robert DeNiro. The other part chronicles the rise in power of Michael Corleone, perfectly played by Al Pacino. If you've never seen this movie, do yourself a favor and rent Godfather and Godfather: PartII. It will be a well spent afternoon.
