To call the characterzations in this movie stereotypes would be an insult to stereotypes. Thirty years ago this movie would have been out of date. Martin and Latifah should be ashamed of themselves to get involved with such a stupid depiction of blacks and whites. The really offensive thing about this movie is that its supposed to be some sort of social commentary.
