When I first saw this movie, not only did it bring tears to my eyes, but it made me think about life in a totally different way. It is the perfect film about the holocaust. Liam Neeson is excellent in this film and Ralph Fiennes is also excellent while he portrays a very strange and sadistic character. This movie at times didn't even seem like a movie, more like you, yourself experiencing these scenes in life.
