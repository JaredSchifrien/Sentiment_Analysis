Nightmare on Elm Street was one of the first of horror films to add depth to the theme by adding a phycological factor. It wasn't just a face hidden behind a mask out to slaughter everyone....Freddy could only enter in your dreams, and only to those who were the children of Elm Street. It made us think more (and sleep less!). It also had the catchy tune (one, two Freddy's coming for you..) that other horror films don't have. My favorite of the Elm Street series are parts one and three. Part one because it's the original and part three because of the unique ways Freddy tortured his victims. Wes Craven is brilliant!
