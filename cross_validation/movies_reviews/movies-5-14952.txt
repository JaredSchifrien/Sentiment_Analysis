Our local radio talk show host (Chuck Baldwin Live Pensacola, Florida) bought out 2 theatres showing The Patriot and offered FREE ADMISSION to his listening audience as a thank you for 6 years on the air. Over 350 people of all ages watched and all loved it! I would rank it as good as a Gone With The Wind epic and I really appreciated a movie that I was able to take my kids to. It taught them some history and patriotic principles. There were some very violent scenes, but I think it needed to be told to show children the horrors of war and the price for freedom!
