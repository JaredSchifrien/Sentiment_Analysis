Stanley Kubrick was an artist, it is quite obvious. He knew exactly how to push the right buttons. With Dr. Strangelove, he pushed as many as he could and still made a very controversial, very ludicrous, very sardonic piece of cinema. But, we cannot place the brilliance of the film at Kubrick's feet alone, for there are plenty others who deserve just as much credit. George C. Scott is brilliant as the often eccentric U.S. general. Peter Sellers, in all three roles is as funny as one can get (athough I think Scott was much better than Sellers here). Sterling Hayden's Col. Ripper is so clearly insane, it is hilarious to hear him talk of the Soviets draining us of our precious fluids. And of course, there is the bomb sequence. Words cannot begin to describe how insanely over-the-top, yet brilliant that scene is! Dr. Strangelove is a great film. Certainly, one of Kubrick's best, and a candidate for one of the greatest movies ever made.
