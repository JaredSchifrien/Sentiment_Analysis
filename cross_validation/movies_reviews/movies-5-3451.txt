More realistic than most people want to admit. The Green Party seizes power in Germant and kicks out the US Army. A revolution in Mexico. This leads to a Soviet led invasion of the United States. The Soviets would not nuke the USA because they desperatly need our fertile farm-land. The USA won't nuke it's own people. A two pronged invasion with troops coming up through Mexico and down though Canada brings a conventional war to mainland America. A ragtag group of young kids in small town, heartland USA see their idyllic little world turned upsidedown by the invasion, they decide to kick some commie butt. This is the plot behind this strangly compelling, and moving, movie. While it does not feature the best acting, and is a litle over the top in its Patriotism, it is still fun to watch. Unlike other war movies, where the good guys come in and save the day, the outcome and final resolution is, in a mild sort of way, unexpected. One of Patrick Swayze's first movies. The group of young freedom fighters are, of course, a disparate group. You have the jocks, the nerds, the smart ones, and the chicks. Sort of like THE BREAKFAST CLUB on steroids. A fairly passable war flick. Ignatious J. Reilly says Check it out.
