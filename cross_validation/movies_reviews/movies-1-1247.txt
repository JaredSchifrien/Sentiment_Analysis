Although I am the biggest John Travolta fan who ever lived, I hated this movie so much! I didn't understand any of it and I thought John's look was a disgrace to the magnificent handsome face God gave him! I only enjoyed ONE part of that movie and that was when he was dancing with Uma. I can't say the acting was bad by any of the actors, but it was the story that was just way beyond my understanding...however I know I am in the minority because of all the people I've ever talked to, they all enjoyed this movie very much!
