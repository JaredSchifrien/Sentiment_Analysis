Up until this movie, Harrison Ford had the most spotless list of good movies that any actor would only dream of having. Some would say that this movie may have started a chain of lacklustre movies. With later titles such as What Lies Beneath and Hollywood Homicide, that may be true. The biggest problem wth this movie, and the main reason why it's so bad, is the concept of the movie. Two different people meet up with one another because the strange simultanious deaths of their lovers. That's it! There is no real plotline to follow up on. The audience is left with no real resolution. You might as well say the movie ends 30 minutes into it. With that in mind, anyone watching will be left in a state of bordem that drains the life out of them the reminder of the time. Do yurelf a favor, and pass this one up. Pick up the Sabrina remake before this one.
