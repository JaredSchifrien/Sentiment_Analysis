This movie is a touching exploration of the human spirit and it is easy to see why it won as many awards as it did. The story deals with three men's problems of readjusting to life after World War II. One of the most poignant characters is Homer, who lost both of his arms during the war. Watching him struggle to adjust to his new life is truly heartbreaking. Homer and the other characters subtly point out the evils of war. They wasted the best years of their lives fighting this war and missed out on the most important thing in life, their time with their families. I can t say enough about how wonderful this movie is; you need to see it for yourself!
