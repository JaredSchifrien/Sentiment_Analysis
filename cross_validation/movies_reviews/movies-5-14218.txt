Beautiful Mind is a beautiful movie. The story of John Nash, in itself, is fascinating. But Russell Crowe's protrayal is a stellar piece of acting. Crowe would have gotten his second straight Oscar for that role, had it not been for an episode of behaving badly to a film exec just before the Oscars. Jennifer Connelly is goddess-like in this film. Her Oscar is well deserved. Scott Glenn, as always, excels. The movie depicts the horrors of going through life as a paranoid schizophrenic. Nash's eventual triumph is overwhelmingly emotional. My favorite parts of the movie is when Nash is cogent and lucid. He was a genius of the highest magnitude. The way the movie demonstrated his Nobel Prize winning theory of economic equilibrium (using the example of picking up women at bars) was one of the neatest things I've seen in the movies.
