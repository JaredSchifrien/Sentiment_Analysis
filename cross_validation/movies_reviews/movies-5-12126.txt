This movie is so stupid, but so, so funny. It's such a relief to see that Rodney Dangerfield is still acting and in this case still funny. Adam Sandler is his usual dumb character, this time Nicky, the son of the devil who is sent to find his 2 brothers who have just broken out of hell. Cameos, cameos. Jon Lovitz and Henry Winkler show up in funny cameo roles.
