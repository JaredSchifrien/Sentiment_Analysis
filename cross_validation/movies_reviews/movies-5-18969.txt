words cannot describe how much i love this movie. this is provably my favorite b-movie ever. bruce campbell is my hero. sam raimi is a genius. ok people who watch this movie and are expecting to be scared are to be sorely dissapointed, because this movie is in no way scary. this movie is hilarious. for anyone with a dark sense of humor, you need to see this movie. it is the perfect blend of horror and comedy. the evil dead trilogy is the best trilogy in the history of moviemaking, and army of darkness is the perfect way to end it all. great acting(you rule bruce!), great one-liners and catch phrases, and and well, an all out great movie.HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!!
