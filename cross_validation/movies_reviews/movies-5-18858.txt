Admittedly, it has its funny parts, but I think that doesn't make it a worse film. On the contrary, the comic scenes make the effect of the horror ones even stronger. The scenes in Scotland are pretty scary. And even now, more than 10 years after I first watched the film, I can't walk down the stairs to Tottenham Court Road tube station in London (where they shot part of the film I believe) without involuntarily looking behind me, and feeling kind of tense. Very good film
