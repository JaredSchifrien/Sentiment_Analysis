This was one of the best movies I have ever seen (and that is saying something)! It really got to the depth of the reality for some people without any sugarcoating. Angelina Jolie was incredible and fascinating to watch as a seemingly coldhearted sociopath. I have to admit I kinda could relate to a few situations in this movie and it really brought up a lot of questions in my mind.
