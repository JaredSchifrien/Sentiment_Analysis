This is a great action movie. I love how the characters are so vivid and unique. The storyline is great; but even moreso, the special effects are awesome! Those twisters looks so real and the acting is so believeable! One of the best scenes is of course, the flying cow (watch out for it if you haven't seen it). The scene at the end of the Twister was literally unbelieveable, but it was nice nonetheless.
