I am a huge Sean Connery and Michael Caine fan, so to have both in the same movie was absolutely amazing and fantastic for me. I had only seen clips of this from the documentaries that I have watched about Sean Connery and I thought it looked absoltely hilarious. It then came on over Christmas this year after yet another documentary on Sean Connery. So I watched it and loved every single minute of it. It follows the two main characters (Connery and Caine) in their quest to become rich and live like kings when they get back to London. But when Connery's character gets mistaken for a God and wears a crown upon his head, the power goes to his head and he refuses to leave even though they have the riches that they had always dreamed of. I won't say how it ends as I don't want to give the whole storyline away. The acting is fantastic, as is the plot and the script. This is definately one that you can watch over and over again.
