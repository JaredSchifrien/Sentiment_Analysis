I've never worked in an office before but I think the theme of wanting to escape a spirit-crushingly tedious job is one that has fairly universal appeal. The boss is spot-on as a wannabe good leader whose attempts to be emollient are horribly grating with his needlessly elongated syllables and patronizing manner. The best scene is when the three central characters take the symbolically oppressive office photocopier to a secluded place and start to smash it up in slow motion to the strains of gangster rap music. Definitely a good film to watch when work is getting you down.
