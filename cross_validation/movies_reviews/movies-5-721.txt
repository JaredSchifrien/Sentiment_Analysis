I love this movie. There are few more satisfying plots than that of a wrongfully accused person who is vindicated and earns the respect of the hard-nosed cop trying to chase him down. The performances were all great, and the dialogue possessed a gritty real-life quality I found refreshing. One minor irritant: It is of course absurd that Ford would wait until after being convicted to track down the one-arm man via his mechanical arm. Not that he had to bother: the movie revealed that Chicago PD interviewed the murderer during their initial investigation. All they would have had to do is show Ford his picture and he would have identified him (the craggy-faced man only disguised himself with a wig for heaven's sake). (I also wonder how the murderer got 13 people to verify he was out of town when he wasn't, but no matter.) Also, since the lack of forced entry into the apartment was a big issue, the first question someone would have asked was if somebody might have had a key. Bingo -- Dr. Nichols borrowed the car, even phoned the murderer from it. Oh well. If they had been so logical we wouldn't have had a gripping, highly entertaining movie. That would been a far bigger irritant.
