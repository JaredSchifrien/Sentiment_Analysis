Hands down, the best movie that I have seen this year. Directed by the same guy who directed Good Will Hunting, the movie has a similar feel to that movie. Older father figure helps young genius reach his potential and learns something about himself along the way. Yet, it is very different and brilliantly written. Sean Connery and Rob Brown are both great (I won't be surprised if they are up for Oscars). You walk out of this movie feeling good, but you aren't clobbered over the head with sweetness. I can't recommend a movie more highly. There is also a surprise cameo towards the end which will give you a chuckle.
