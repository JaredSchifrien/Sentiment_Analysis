This was a tremendous cinematic achievement and should be remembered as one the top films of the last 10-15 years. Brilliantly put together by Robert Zemeckis, Who Framed Roger Rabbit brings the world of live action together with the world of animation. You get absolutely lost in the interaction and forget that there is obviously no way that Eddie Valiant could be having a conversation with an animated rabbit. This combination of live action with animation would by itself make this a remarkable movie-making feat. But, the story is great, as well. It is both laugh out loud funny and quite touching and heart-warming. If you have always gone right by this film as you've been deciding what to rent or buy, next time stop and grab it. You'll love it whether you're 8, 28, 48, or 68.
