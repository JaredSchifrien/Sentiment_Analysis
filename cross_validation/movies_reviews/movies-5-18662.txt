This is one of those movies that comes along once in a while and hits the nail on the head and creates a genre. Sometimes a low budget flick with a no-name cast does it--this is one of those. It is not as violent as advertised and does have some sterotypes, i.e. crazed Southern inbred backwoods family. But put your skepticism aside and revel in the horror and suspense of the effort.
