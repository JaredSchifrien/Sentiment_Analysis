Probably one of my all-time favorites. What amazing chemistry that the late John Candy and Steve Martin exhibited in this film! I was laughing my tail off every five minutes- there was never a dull moment. The two scenes that stick most in my mind is Martin's rude comments to the lasy in the car rental center, only to recieve an equally rude You're f@*%! . I'm not too big a fan of the f word, but I thought that the way that Martin used it was hilarious. And who can ever forget the best of them all: THOSE AREN'T PILLOWS! . If you have not seen this, you don't know what your missing!
