This piece of trash is a total embarassment to anyone even remotely associated with it, an insult to the underlying concept that was gravely compromised and perverted, and total torture to anyone who might happen to view it. It's a quest for failure when one tries to develop a feature film from something as minor and narrow as an album concept, but the pinheads who bankrolled and churned out this bucket of vomit apparently didn't let caveat thinking get in their way. And any creative project with The World's Lamest Pop Band, those absolutely obnoxious, tone deaf and wimped out Bee Gees, is doomed to be a total disaster. Involving those pathetic Beatle-wannabes in this suspect initiative was the final Death Sentence.
