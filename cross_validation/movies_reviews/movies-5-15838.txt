It was so refreshing seeing this movie after having a bad year for movies. Sure, there were the blockbusters like Gladiator, Patriot and The Grinch but overall, I have been really disappointed in the movies out this past year, until I saw Quills last weekend. I left the theater thrilled to have seen a funny, dramatic, well done, great movie. It stars Geoffery Rush (from Shining), Kate Winslet, and Joequin Phoenix (sp?). The three of them were amazing in this movie. Quills was about the writter/playwrite Marque. Marque wrote about his passions and human sexual urges that in that time were considered wrong. Writing was his life. It is what kept him sane. In this film, you see the power of his writing on others, on himself and the destruction when writing is taken away from him. I really don't want to say too much more because I really want people to go see this movie. It was so good. From the previews, you might think it would be slow but it is full of emotions, drama, action. I wasn't bored at all. I really recommend going and seeing this movie, you will be pleasently surprised. And a side note to hkill, sex can be dirty, or beautiful, or fun, or playful, or twisted. It can be a lot of things. It can be seen as art and Quills not only shows the passion in sex, but the passion in living and human experiences. It explores a lot more topics than just sex. It is about love as well. Censorship, power, corruption, greed, friendship, religion. If you could get your chaste belt off, you might see that.
