Seeing a stupid comedy like Monty Python being number one and a witty and fun comedy like this being number 102 is an insult. This is an awesome comedy everybody needs to see. The story is a cartoon Rabit get frammed for murder and the only guy who can save him is a former cartoon detective. Adults will love the adult themes and play on words while kids will like seeing the cartoons and the slapstick. One of the greatest films of all time that no one can resist and that's all folks.
