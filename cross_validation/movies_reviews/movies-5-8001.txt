My favority comedy of the 80's, the golden years of comedy. I think the line there are two lines that say it all for me. The first from Murray near the beginning of the movie when his girlfriend leaves him and the second from Ramis when they are being interviewed by the army enlistment officer. One- "But who will water the plants?" Two - "No, we're not homosexual, but we are willing to try."
