This film was the perfect close to the most explosive trilogy in film history. Of the three origional films, this one is definately my favorite for a number of reasons. The battle scenes were wonderful, and the special effects, were, as to be expected coming from George Lucas, absolutely breathtaking. Everything seemed to come into place in this film with the death of Yoda and the subsequent death of Darth Vader. I enjoyed the last 30 minutes of the film the most, espescially the final battle scene between Vader and Luke, and I thought that having Vader save his son by killing the Emperor was the perfect way to solidify that old saying- blood is thicker than water. At least that is how I interprited it. In my opinion, this one was the best of the entire trilogy and the perfect closure. BTW, the Ewoks are awesome!
