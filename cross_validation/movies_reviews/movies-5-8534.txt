I'd have to say that Steve Martin in his prime was one of the funniest people ever, and the Jerk is great evidence. From the physical comedy of his discovery of rhythm to all the great stupid antics, this one is great from start to finish. Many of the lines have become classics that I find myself using in daily life: Oh so it's a profit thing! (after Mavin Johnson is told not to feel bad about his poor record as a weight-guesser) I don't want the money. I just want the stuff. (says Marie when Mavin goes broke) By the way, I'm glad also that Medgar Evers mentioned how great Bernadette Peters is in this. I absolutely fell in love with her in this movie, and wish I could have pulled on her face to observe the tightness of her face-skin just like Steve got to.
