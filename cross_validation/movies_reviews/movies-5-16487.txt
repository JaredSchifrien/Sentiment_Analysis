DiCaprio acts a real Romeo who contrats perfectly well with all the violence, hatred and the exhuberantly burning in colours and some even grotesque scenery. The director was a genius capturing the esence of the story. And a genuis at casting, too. Shakespeare would have loved it! The best R J I have ever seen.
