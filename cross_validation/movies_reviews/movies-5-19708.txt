I must highly recommend this movie if you are into the Jack the Ripper mystery at all. It took the theory that I like the most, and put a slight twist on it. The movie also came from Alan Moore's great From Hell comic series, which is what initially got me interested, and I must recommend that you check them out if you liked the movie.
