I've never understood what Mike Myers' problem was, but I bought the premise that he's evil incarnate hook line sinker. I also fell for his inability to die - a silly premise, but you believe it in this movie. Frankly, I don't know why the movie works - maybe that awesome, simple sequenced music score, the director's use of complementary colors (orange blue), his use of suburbia as a backdrop, the fact that there are no parents anywhere around after Michael shows up on the scene - I thought the quick view of Michael under the mask wasn't necessary, but that's my only gripe. of course this one is the 1st modern slasher film (really Psycho is the 1st - compare the 2 and you'll see where Halloween's influence comes from. I'll give you a hint: think swinging light bulb). Why did Michael dress as a ghost, why the RIP headstone, why did he seem like a collector when he kills the only guy, why is he so pissed off at women, and why he won't die - I think part of the movie's effect is all these unanswered questions. Is he dead? Where did he go? Is he hiding near you?
