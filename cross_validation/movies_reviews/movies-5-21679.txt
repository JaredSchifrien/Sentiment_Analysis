George Lucas has outdone himself with the final movie of the Star Wars trilogy. This movie shows that the force has a way of balancing good and evil. I liked the story, the props and setting used in the story, the technology concepts, and revealing of Jabba the Hut was unforgettable. The true glory of a revolution and efforts of one Jedi can show one that we are never limited in any of our dreams.
