I saw The Green Mile two weeks ago and thought this was the best movie I have seen since Saving Private Ryan . Then I saw Hurricane and I had a new most recent Favorite. If Denzel does not get an Oscar for this it would be a travesty. Just as Ruben Hurricane Carter's book acted as the catalyst for his freedom and this movie, his movie has inspired me to read his book and learn more about his amazing life.
