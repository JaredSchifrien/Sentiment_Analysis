What an amazingly complex and great movie! I've seen this movie at least 30 times over the last 20 years and I always see new things and have new realizations. The DVD version with comments by Waters and Scarfe demonstrates just how much thought was put into making sure the movie stayed true to the vision and the message. Summary: The quality of the music goes without saying, The Wall is a Floyd masterpiece. The animation is powerful. The acting fills out the characters, and the entire concept, with it's stories within stories and multiple layers of meaning, stretches the mind. One caution, though, the topic is depressing, and it helps to be VERY familiar with the lyrics and music of the album before seeing the movie. Also, you really need to watch it more than once, and watch out for loops of time within other loops of time... the story line is NOT linear. ENJOY!
