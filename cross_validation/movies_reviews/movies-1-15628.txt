This movie was absolute tripe, awful!! You can tell the story was taken from a well written book and instead of being true to the book it was completely hollywood-ised, where half-way through we were seeing the whose who of hollywood which completely detracted from the movie. Nicole Kidman is a good actress, but this movie failed to stretch her ability or show any of her growing potential like The Hours or The Others. The accents were awful, if your getting paid $15 million for a movie the least you could do is show some respect to the audiences intelligence and do a convincing southern accent.
