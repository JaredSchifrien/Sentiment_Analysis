Any film that supports the freedom of self expression and freedom of speech is way up in my book. The People vs. Larry Flint chronicles the story of Hustler magazine creator and publisher, Larry Flint. Starring a wonderfully talented cast including Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love and Edward Norton all turning in very praise worthy performances. Awarded with several awards and nominations. This film really makes Flint out to be a hero. Someone who stood for his rights and what he believed in. In a way, Flint is a hero in that light. He wanted his smut magazine in the market and damn you if you stood in his way. The People vs Larry Flint also manages to tug on some heart strings as it follows the declining health of Larry's wife to the AIDS virus. A very powerful and thought provoking film. Makes you proud to be an American. Well, most of us who fight for freedom in this country.
