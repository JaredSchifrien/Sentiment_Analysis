A movie that makes you think about life and all the bad things that come along with it. It delves into the dark, taboo things of American society yet it makes you see the beauty in everyday life that we take for granted. Weird movie that keeps getting weirder, but in the end everything comes together and makes sense. Great writing, acting, and really funny!
