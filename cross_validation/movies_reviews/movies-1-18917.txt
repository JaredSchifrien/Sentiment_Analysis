You people are so thirsty for a good horror film you seem to settle for cheap hour and a half long X-File knock off garbage. I saw this film the night it was realesed with high hopes of a great Exorcist like film. I wanted to be jolted I wanted to be frightened and I wanted the film to give me something to think about. Instead I got another high budget attempt at money making. This film is prpackaged cotton candy crap! I think my I.Q. dropped 10 points just from witnessing such an attrocity. I was ashamed. I am all for religion in cinema. I myself am not a religious man at all even though I was raised in a christian house hold. I can see how some people got a message from Stigmata and I can see how it opens some peoples eyes to a new world but those people must realize this new world they are seeing is based in a lame fictitious horror movie world that is based in no solid evidence and is made to make the schmuks who believe the tabloids paranoid. Sad stuff,man...
