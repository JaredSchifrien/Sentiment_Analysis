I have no clue how to start. The movie is breath taking. Not only was there a superb case (including ellen burstyn, jennifer conelly, jared leto, and marlon wayans) but the effect the movie had on me was amazing. I had just finished reading the novel and immediately had to see the movie. the reality of it makes you sick to your stomach, but the reality keeps you from turning away. Marlon Wayans perfomed astoundingly well, a major turn from his somewhat comical roles he normally assumes. Ellen Burstyn's performance brought me to tears. I would highly recommend this show to any true movie fan.
