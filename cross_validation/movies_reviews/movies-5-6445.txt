As others have previously stated, this film's strength lies in its unique, quirky, outside-the box originality. There is simply no other western quite like it, as it stretches the genre in directions it seldom ever ventures. Perhaps this is why the film was/is such a hit in France - there is even a French website dedicated to the film. The AMC channel also broadcasts Johnny Guitar about once or twice a year, and I highly recommend watching it for Peggy Lee's haunting title soundtrack alone. Joan Crawford portrays a pre-feminist-femme-fatale, who if necessary, can trade verbal jabs or bullets with any man or woman who crosses her. Certainly not your typical 1950's fare, which is one more reason to check it out.
