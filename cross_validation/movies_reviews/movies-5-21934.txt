One of the few movies where I actually liked the sequel better than the original. T2 is an extremely well made movie - the special effects, the casting, the background music - everything hangs together to give you a movie which will keep you tense throughout. The chase scene in which the the evil terminator (masterfully played by Robert Patrick), driving an 18 wheeler, is chasing Arnold and the boy on their Harley, is far and away the best chase scene which I have seen. T2 is pure excitement from beginning to end.
