absolutely loved this movie and always will. my favorite non sci-fi film ever(barley beating out mad max and saturday night fever) wow what a film. i was sixteen when i saw this flim and to say it totally absorbed me is an understatement. to me tom curise will always be maverick val will always be the iceman and of course athony edwards will always be goose. at least to me anyway. this movie had it all music, great cast, awsome special effects dog fighting scenes. i mean this film made me want to be a pilot and not just any pilot but a naval aviator.(officer and a gentlman did the same to a lesser extent) still love the songsfrom the soundtrack (especially mighty wings by cheap trick) another film with a great bulid up opening. try to find a guy who was a teenager in the mid 80's who didn't love or at least like this movie. a very personal favorite for me. i feel the need ,the need for speed. film still looks good today for a 80's movie.
