You have GOT to be kidding me. THis movie is so boring, so violent, so nihilistic and acted so terribly that it seems like no one would like it, but everyone does. It glorifies criminals who kill not just one, but hundreds. It also has protagonists that beat their wives, cuss up a storm and are apathetic towards moral, good people. Also, the length of the movie is insanely long. The movie is re-aired so much on television that it gets terribly annoying to even hear it is coming on the tele. It lacks the energy, creativity, and optimism of masterpieces like Star Trek, Star Wars, Pokemon, Toy Story and so many more great, underrated franchises. Get out of here bad movie, it's a deal you can't refuse.
