My friend and fellow reviewer, The Marquis (who loved this movie so much he borrowed the name) asked me to go along with him to see this movie. I hadn't heard much of it except for it's sexual brutality. Needless to say within 5 minutes I was totally engrossed in the film. Take a brilliant performance by Geoffrey Rush, add in Michael Caine and along with a great story (although fictionalized somewhat) and you've got an Oscar-deserving movie. The review by The Marquis was a bit harsh on the Joaquin Phoenix, but accent aside he also puts on a great performance-not quite the caliber of Rush and Caine but everyone needs to start somewhere. This film is not for everyone but if you want to laugh and yet be shocked by the way this movie displays hypocrisy then go and enjoy this film.
