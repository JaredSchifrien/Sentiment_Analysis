wow -- this is THE BEST MOVIE EVER! So easy to follow, so hilarious. My favorite two scenes (very hard to pick) would have to be burn the witch, very useful information on how to tell whether or not someone is a witch. The next, bring out your dead, how to pick up dead people, or the almost dead... this is just a great movie all together. I love it! If you haven't seen it, at least rent it, but i reccomend buying it, whenever you need a good laugh just pick it up and watch it -- or just your favorite scenes! Its awesome! If you don't like movies that have no point then you might not appreciate it as much, but it is awesome!
