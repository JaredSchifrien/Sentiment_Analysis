Not your typical Hollywood sports or animal flick. Character development is a focus, showing the humble beginnings of key figures who'd taken their knocks during the Depression Era. Provides a realistic sense of history, and why Americans took a personal stake in the races of a once-ridiculed horse. Likewise, it's easy to get caught up in the movie, as all the cast shines admirably. Based on Laura Hillenbrand's superb 2001 book. It's PG-13, but many age groups would enjoy it.
