This has such excellent writing, I'd definitely consider it among the very best movies of the 1980s. Though the last 20 minutes are pretty lame, the large majority of it is wonderfully great. I'm actually not a big fan of dark comedies, but this one gets me every time. (I also like the allusions to the late great rock band, the Replacements -- Westerberg High and color me impressed -- I remember seeing some interview with Winona saying that she used that band's Sixteen Blue to get into character for this film.)
