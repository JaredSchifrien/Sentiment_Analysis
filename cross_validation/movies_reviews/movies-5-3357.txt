The first movie made in the U.S. with Jet Li. The excitement of Jet Li's movies combined with the real life experience of modern Oakland makes this movie great. The special effects are some that are both exciting and gruesome. Russell Wong and Jet Li's fight scene is perhaps one of the best in any movie I ever watched.
