I think it is a tribute to the set designers, photographers and Gibson as a director that people complain about the historical accuracy of this superior epic film. Clearly, the presentation looked so realistic that some think the story was meant to be equally as realistic. Not exactly true; the William Wallace of legend is the subject here, not the Wallace of history. Wallace is a legendary leader in Scotland in much the same way that Davy Crockett is in the US; both have had their deeds exaggerated. In any case, Braveheart is one of the finest films I have ever seen and is also one of the most exciting and satisfying.
