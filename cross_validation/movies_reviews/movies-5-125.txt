I found Silence of the Lambs to be one of the greatest horror films ever made because it works on two levels. First it is a brilliant psychological thriller and two it is a shocking bizzare and often time frightning horror film. Not to metion a breakthrough script,magnificent directing and ingenious performances from Jodie Foster and (The Man) Anthony Hopkin's as the now famed Hannibal Lector. This picture put the thriller suspence type movie goers in the same theater with Friday the Thirtenth fans. A breakthrough film through and through. HIGHL HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! This is a thinking man's horror picture.
