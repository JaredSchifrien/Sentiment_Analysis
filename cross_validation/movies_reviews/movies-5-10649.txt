Very good film. I had been anticipating this picture heavily ever since I had fallen in love with Thora Birch in American Beauty. I was not dissapointed with this movie which is based off a sorely under appriciated graphic novel of the same title. This movie takes place following the graduation of two teenage girls who have always planned on moving in together and being forever friends. Their pleasure is scrutinizing and making fun of strangers. One day they are reading the personals and come across one that a man has placed seeking a woman he met on a plane ride. The two girls find this utterly pathetic and deside to call him, pretending to be the woman, set a date, and then go watch him as the date never shows up. Thora's character then becomes curious about the man (Steve Buscimi) and slowly grows attached as her best friend slowly grows away from her. Thora is in top form in this bitter comedy. She has mastered the bitter girl and I can't wait to see her in her next film.Simplistic in form and mature in subject. VERY good movie. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
