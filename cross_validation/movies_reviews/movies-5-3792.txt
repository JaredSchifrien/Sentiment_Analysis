It was great!I really had doubts going in to watch this movie because of the fact that Paul Walker was the only main character from the first movie returning.But i must admit,he actually managed to carry the film (with alot of help from co-star Tyrese) beyond the original blockbuster.I never thought they could make a good sequel without Vin Diesel,but i was wrong.Truth is,Vin should have starred in this movie than that lame XXX movie which was just a big letdown.I also thought Director,John Singleton,did a great job......HOWEVER,if theres only one thing that i thought let this film down was the fact that there was only TWO real street race scenes in this movie,otherwise its flawless
