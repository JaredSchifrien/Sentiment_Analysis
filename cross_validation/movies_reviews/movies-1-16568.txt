I do not know what led me to believe this would be a comedy but I was truly disappointed when I quickly found that it wasn t. I was further disappointed that the entire story was depressing, pointless and had an ugly edginess to it. Drew Barrymore did not convince me that she was this woman at the age of 15, 36 or anything in between. She further failed to convince me that her character was deserving of my sympathy or respect. Half the time I wanted to slap some sense into her and the other half I simply lost interest in her self-involved mindset. She set herself up, she fell and then she proceeded to whine and blame everyone around her. I kept wanting to say if you re as smart as you think you are and if college and career are so important to you then get off your butt, get a part-time job, a student loan and go for it you know, join the rest of the real world. Were we really supposed to feel sorry for this self-interested idiot who ignores her child and proceeds to dry pot in the oven of her government subsidized shack for some quick cash? Apparently no more than we were meant to enjoy this dreadful tale of woe.
