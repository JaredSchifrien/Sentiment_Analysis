One of the most brilliant things in this movie is the environment. The colors are just amazing, and they've got every detail just perfect- from the light reflecting off of the water to the smooth texture of the enemony where Nemo lives to the stuff floating around in the water. The plot is amazing too. A story about a young clownfish named Nemo with an over-protective father. They get seperated when Nemo is caught by a diver, and is taken to sydney. Nemo's Father frantically searches for him, and comes across a fish named Dory, who can help him find his son- if it wasn't for her short term memory loss. The two go through many obsticals, from nearly being dinner for a shark, to swimming through a field of jelly fish, all the while Dory cracks Nemo's Father of his fear of the ocean. Meanwhile Nemo is taken to a Dentist's fishtank, where he meets the Tank Gang which includes some interesting characters. In the end Nemo and Father are re-united and Father learns to be less cautious anout everything. This movie was both touching and Hysterical. The stars of the movie, Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres were amazing. Albert was really good at deteriorating that joke....which is either good, or bad...and Ellen was just perfect at playing short-term memory loss.
