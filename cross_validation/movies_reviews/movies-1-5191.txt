Here are some of the crude references in this movie: -An acronym for the word S. H. I. T. -The Cat picks up a hoe in the yard and says, "You dirty hoe!" -The Cat makes a reference to an erection when he looks at the kids' mom's photo -The Cat chops off his tail (there's no blood) and he screams, SON OF A (it is bleeped out) I never smiled during this movie. And I certainly never laughed. It is offensive and crude, but it is not funny. And it is BORING. Do not see this film. And do not under any circumstances let children see this movie, or their childhood memories of The Cat in the Hat will be shattered before their eyes.
