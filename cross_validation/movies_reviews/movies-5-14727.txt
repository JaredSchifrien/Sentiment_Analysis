Had all the ingredients necessary for a great movie: strong plot, good dialogue, romance, intrigue, and a leading lady who was as exceptional an actress as she was beautiful. This is one of the most well done David and Goliath stories I have seen in a long time. I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone, regardless of their movie prefs.
