This is a really good movie! I'd have to say that the best part of it was the way that it was visually presented, with a dark, bleak atmosphere pervading the entire film (with a few important plot line exceptions, of course, such as the oracle's house). There was a great amount of visual detail throughout, especially in the climax, which was arranged to look just like a shoot'em up, arcade style video game.
