I rate this film terrible with the same confidence that I gave the murderous dictator Joseph Stalin a one-star ranking in another RIA category. With a star-studded cast like this (Helen Hunt, Richard Gere, Kate Hudson, Farrah Faucet, Laura Dern, etc...) you'd think there would be something redeeming about the plot, characters, anything! There is nothinig good to say about this film. I issue a challenge to find something good about this film, the very worst film I've seen except perhaps for Caddyshack II, The Last Unicorn, and Dark Crystal. Actually, Dark Crystal may have been better than this.
