At the very beginning of the picture the camera moves (or appears to move) through the trees and the changing perspective of the branches gives a 3-D effect. The sheer beauty of these images is breathtaking. Then the characters are introduced. Thumper's delicious southern accent and mannerisms, Flower's modesty ( You can call me Flower if you want to ), and the antics of the minor characters - all combine in a rich mixture of images. And then there is the music - Little April Showers - a lovely musical arrangement and superbly sung. And all this without a mention so far of the tear-jerking plot. This wonderful film surely deserves its 5 stars.
