WOW.... My favorite movie. The plot line, actors, and the directing were fabulous. This movie was a psychological thriller without any major actions scenes. It made me evaluate what/how I see things. I would defintley recommend this movie to an older audience (not young teens). The actors deserved the awards they got for their roles in this film!!!
