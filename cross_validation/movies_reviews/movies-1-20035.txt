Like many of the raters here, I concur that this movie was one of the sorriest ever put out. It was hyped over the Al Gore-invented internet and that led to some fake buzz. I was never scared during the movie; instead I got madder and madder as I sat through this crap. I wondered how I got took on such bulls***it as this? This worthless piece of junk shouldn't be classified as horror. I've seen home movies with more terror than this. My first hair-cut on camera beat this crap. Thank goodness now everyone knows this & it's crappy sequel are pure junk!
