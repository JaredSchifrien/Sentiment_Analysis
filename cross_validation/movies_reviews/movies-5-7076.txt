Mel Brooks is a genius. So is Gene Wilder. And Terri Garr is just fun to look at. (We won't mention Feldman.) Anyway, I can't think of another black-and-white monster movie that's made me laugh more often than this one. *wolf howls* Inga: Werewolf! Dr. Frankenstein: Werewolf? Igor *points*: There. There wolf. There castle. Dr. Frankenstein: Why are you talking like that? Igor: I thought you wanted to. Dr. Frankenstein: No. Igor: *shrug* Suit yourself. I'm easy.
