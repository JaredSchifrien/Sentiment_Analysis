This movie is both inspirational and proves to be another one of Denzel Washington's great performances. Based on the true story of an African-American who becomes a football coach and evokes emotion and to see through colour in his overrun white football team. It is filmed beautifully and along with the highly emotional scenes, it also has a few funny moments (e.g. learning the white and black dislikes and likes in pairs). The DVD also has features explaining the meanings of certain scenes and an orray of deleted scenes. This is a truely beautifully told true story and teaches us to look beyond colour into the brave and wise words of Herman Boone.
