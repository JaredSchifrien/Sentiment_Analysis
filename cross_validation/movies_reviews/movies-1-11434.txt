Okay, so this was 2 hours of my life I'll never get back! I'm sorry, I just didn't think this movie was funny at all. I didn't laugh (or even chuckle for that fact) once. It just really didn't appear to have much of a plot. The acting was mediocre...but, to me, it seemed like they weren't familiar w/ their lines or the directing bad or something.
