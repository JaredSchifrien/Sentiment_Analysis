Freebird is right about one thing; I am glad I only rented this. Very boring, and extremely disorganized. Ray Romano's comic talents quickly gave way to a poorly written script, and extremely cliched jokes about politicians. I didn't even know which one to route for in that election; neither one seemed any better or worse than the other.
