I had nightmares for a whole week after watching this movie. If there is any part of you that believes in religion, evil, or the existence of other forms or spirits, this movie will be very entertaining. It's very realistic-no Freddy Krueger's or Jason's. It's more of a psychological thriller that questions your belief in whether evil can exist and effect us, and whether faith can save us.
