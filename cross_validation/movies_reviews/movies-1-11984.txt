What was the climax of this stupid movie. Where Jason Biggs says the F word to shock the 9 years olds that were watching it? Or was it when Jason Biggs punches that dude in the library and then becomes this hero guy. This movie was definately aimed at 8-11 year olds so they can brag to there friends that they saw a PG-13 movie. It terribly falls flat. No jokes (or at least good ones), nothing new. Blah.
