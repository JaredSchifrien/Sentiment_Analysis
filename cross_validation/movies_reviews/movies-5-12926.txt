I believe The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie ever created. The movie was directed extremely well, it has excellent cast, and above all, it has brilliant and wonderful story. It is funny, sensitizes, sophisticated and has an astonishing end - every thing a movie should have. When I first saw this movie, I was very impressed, especially from its end. From that time, I manage to see it at least ten times and each time I saw it again, I enjoy it like I haven t seen it at all; I even see things that I haven t noticed before. I think that everyone should see this movie at least one time, and if you haven t seen it yet, go see it - I promise you that you ll enjoy every second of it.
