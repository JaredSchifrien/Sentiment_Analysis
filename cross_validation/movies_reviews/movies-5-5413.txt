 It's a Wonderful Life Is a real classic, and it is a good lesson for anyone to learn who feels useless, and that his or her life has little or no meaning. People who feel discouraged with life can take a look at their life and think back at all the good that has come , and there most likely are people who could not have done without you. It is a good look at how one person's life can affect the lives of those around him in a positive way, and as far as Mr.Potter goes,in a negative way. So you can really appreciate a movie like this to help one find meaning in life.
