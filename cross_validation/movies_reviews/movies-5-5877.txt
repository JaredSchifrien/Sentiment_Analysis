This was the first David Lean film I've ever seen and so far the best. Lean has a real talent of making a shocking moment, which he did in this several times and in The Bridge On The River Kwai. I was shocked at the greatness. At the moment my #3 movie (surpassed only by The Godfather and Pulp Fiction). Wow! See this movie.
