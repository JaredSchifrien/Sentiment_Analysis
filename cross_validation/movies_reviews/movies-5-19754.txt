I always liked this movie. No one gives The Blob creature enough credit, though. It must have had supernatural powers. You see, it was so slow-moving that a snail or an earthworm could have made a quick get-a-way. But, the human victims froze in their tracks...too paralyzed with fear to even inch backwards and, thus, met their fate...alien aspic...
