A very good action/thriller with a strong cast. This is a movie which requires you to pay attention in order to fully understand the ending, which is a great twist. This film is Benicio Del Toro's breakthrough role, in which he plays a character that will give you a few laughs. Overall, a strong thriller, with a good cast and a superb ending.
