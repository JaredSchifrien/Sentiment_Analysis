My entire family enjoyed the film immensely. I put it above Chamber of Secrets (4.5) and the first Harry Potter flick (I rated it a 4). GO SEE IT ASAP. I have a different perspective on the Harry Potter movies. I have never read a syllable of any of J. K. Rowlings fine books, so everything I know about Potter is from the movies. I found the first Harry Potter a bit slow at the onset as they had to develop the story for all us muggles. With each subsequent Potter, we are now all familiar with the characters and enjoy a tightly-wove story. Prisoner of Azkaban was darker than the previous, albeit more compelling to adult viewers. There are some parts that might be a bit too intense to the wee ones. While I note some complaints from RIA Reviewers, speaking for the non-Potter readers, we really don't care if the movie doesn't expound on the significance of, let's say, why Harry Potter wipes his nose with his right sleeve instead of his left sleeve even though Dame Rowling might spend 10 pages on it. We saw Peter Jackson try to cram every minutae in LOTR Return of the King and I felt that it bogged down the movie. Things to check out in this movie: 1) Gary Oldman's stellar performance as the Prisoner; 2) The special effects are truly awesome; 3) The girl that plays Hermoine Granger keeps getting cuter and cuter. She's one tarty little witch. Her little witchy butt in tight jeans is displayed quite often.
