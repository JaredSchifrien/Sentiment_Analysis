For me, this is the movie in which Tom Cruise came into his own as an actor. And that in a movie in which Dustin Hoffman delivers perhaps the best performance of his career. Rain Man is the touching story of a young man who comes to terms with his autistic brother, and in the process grows up a little bit.
