It's hard to imagine a stranger screen couple than Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon. She's an elderly lady with a zest for life after surviving the holocaust, and he's a very young guy obsessed with death, who fakes his own suicides on a constant basis just to upset his mother. It's a pretty dark comedy, but some of Cort's fake suicides and his mother's reactions to them are hilarious.
