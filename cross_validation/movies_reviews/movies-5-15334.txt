I love Charlize!! It was amazing how they made her look like Aileen. She looked just like Aileen...but a younger version of her. This movie was excellent, and Charlize was stellar. This movie was a big break for her. The end was so sad and made me cry. I liked this movie so much that I bought it on dvd the first day it came out. Charlize definitely deserved all the awards she received for this film.
