The tag 'first of a kind' may be a bit of a stretch, but I don't remember too many movies where Sci-fi, suspense horror were so neatly put together before Alien. Another twist was that the Captain is the first major figure to go - surely that broke the rules and we have a action heroine as well! Great movie.
