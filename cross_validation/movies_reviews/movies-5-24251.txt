this shouldn't be in sci fi, though it involves no magic. it's really psychological horror. cronenberg, who i'm now convinced was dropped on his head as an infant, does the same thing in another film of his, existenz but with virtual reality. videodrome blurs personal identity and tethers its characters to psychosis with brainwashing videotapes, that ultimately, along with the weird-ass score, create new nauseating depths of perversion. cool film. blondie's in it, and she's cute.
