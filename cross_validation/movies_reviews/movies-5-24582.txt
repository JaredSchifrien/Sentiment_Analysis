Anyone, and I mean ANYONE, who has ever been accused of road-rage should LOVE this movie. Sure, the cars are nightmarishly cheesy and Stallone proved to anyone who has seen this movie that he can't act, but the movie is AWESOME. In a futuristic society, Death Race is the main spectator sport, supported by the government and loved by everyone, even the victims! A mind-blowing concept! Pop it in and WATCH THIS MOVIE. A real classic! (hey sis, how much for the dirtbag on the corner?)
