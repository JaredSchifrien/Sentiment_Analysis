What a great movie this is. I haven't seen it in a long time, but I remember it being one creepy flick... two scenes in particular really scared me - the one where C. Thomas Howell looks out of the car he is riding in to see Rutger Hauer riding in a station wagon with a family, with kids sitting on his lap... you just know that something terrible is going to happen. The most memorable scene from the movie may have been C. Thomas Howell getting an order of fries at the diner only to find.... well, I won't give it away. Very scary, very well done movie.
