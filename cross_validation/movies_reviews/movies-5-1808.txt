Perfect performances by Douglas, Close and Anne Archer. Michael Douglas is an excellent actor, he always plays these characters where you don't know whether to root for him or hate him. My friend and I always talk about the fact why Dan would have an affair when his wife is gorgeous, sweet and the perfect woman. Close looks like a drag queen compared to her. But, hey, why does anyone have affairs? Awesome movie, though !!!
