EXCELLENT Movie..one of my all time favorites. This movie had everything..great actors, an incredible script, perfect soundtrack. One of those movies that you have no doubt these people actually exist, you forget they are acting..and throughout all of the craziness, for some odd, unknown reason, you want to be a part of this crazy life! Why is that?..same with the Godfather! The ending was incredible..and the music along with the montage-perfect.
