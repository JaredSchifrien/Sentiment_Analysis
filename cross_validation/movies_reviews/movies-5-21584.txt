They could have butchered this film, but I am relieved to find that Peter Jackson found competant actors to bring this story to life. There are two great things about this movie. One is Ian McKellan's Gandalf, who is absolutely brilliant and was shafted for best supporting actor. The other great thing about the movie was the suspense and fear it created. In short they did evil right. Kudos to all those involved. I loved every second.
