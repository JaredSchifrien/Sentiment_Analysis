ive never had a movie touch me as much as this one has. one of the most depressing movies i have ever seen, but one of the most honest movies i've seen. this a movie about drugs and how they can destroy a relationship between a mother and her son, two best friends, a perfectly happy couple. after this movie was over, i was in awe. i didn't know what to say. i didn't know who had it worse. i was just amazed. leto's performance was amazing, and it was great to see marlon wayans in a serious role ellen... man, just everyone gave an outstanding performance. great, great score too. beatifully directed. i'm shocked that they didn't take home any oscars. one of the best movies i have seen scince american beauty.a must see...
