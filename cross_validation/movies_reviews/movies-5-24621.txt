Planet of the Apes rocks! Lots of action, great story and incredible acting. I don't know what you all are talking about with th 3 star ratings. I was around for the first wave of Planet of the Apes, and this is so much better. Very realistic, great production. I cannot wait to get my hands on the DVD.
