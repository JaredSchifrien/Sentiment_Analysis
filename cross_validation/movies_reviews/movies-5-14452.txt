Hoosiers will remain the greatest sports movie of all time. If you have only seen it on TV, you must rent a copy and see it all. TV almost always cuts out great dialog and scenes that are classics alone. What the movie doesn't tell you is that this small town team also had to win two games in the Semistate round and an afternoon game in the finals. This means they won two games a day three consecutive weekends after their Sectional to win the state. Not to mention they (The Milan Indians) went to the final four the year before (1953). Milan had a total enrollment of 161 in 1954. While you are at the video store, get a copy of Breaking Away. It's another underdog sports story that won Academy Award for Dialog.
