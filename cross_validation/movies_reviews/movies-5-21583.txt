I love the Lord of the rings! While, as stated many other itmes on these pages, the movies did not stick completely to the books, it was excelent. I loved every aspect of the enitre movie and love the two towers as well. I can't wait for the third enstallment to come out this christmas. Peter jackson did an excelent job portraying the true heart of the story and all of the actors did excellent as well. I got the FOTR movie for christams and now the film is worn out if that tells you anything about how good it is!
