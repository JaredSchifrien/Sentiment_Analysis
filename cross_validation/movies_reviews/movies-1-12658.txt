This movie failed on all levels with me. First of all, if you've seen The Ring, nothing in this movie will surprise you. Samara isn't nearly as scary in this one as in the first one. It was far to easy to tell when it was Aiden, or Samara in the possession scenes, and I didn't think Rachel's acting was particularly good at any point in the movie. The special effects in this film are pretty much what you got in the first one, no surprises there. There are two good effects moments, though. The deer attacking the car (Why didn't Rachel just listen to Aiden and keep driving?) and the bathtub scene (Why didn't Rachel listen to Aiden when he said he didn't want to take a bath?). Those two scenes were the highlight of an otherwise dull and unremarkable film. Skip it.
