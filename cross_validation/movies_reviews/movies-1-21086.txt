A stupid, inconsequential musical based on the life of a totally unimportant dictator's wife, who was also totally unimportant in her own right. Useless premise supported by a typically wan, banal and limp score concocted by that dreadful A.L. Webber, the composer of some of worst crap ever heard by humankind. Add the most overrated no-talent since Bing Crosby/Bob Hope, namely Madonna, who can't sing, dance or act (a triple threat) and wooden, sleazy-looking Antonio Banderas, and you have the workings of a feature film whose entire contents should have been left on the cutting room floor. A friend of mine rented this video for a small social gathering, and we laughed and laughed at how atrociously bad this cultural afterbirth was. Who bankrolls crap like this? And better yet, you actually coughs up the $$$ to actually go see this in a theatre?
