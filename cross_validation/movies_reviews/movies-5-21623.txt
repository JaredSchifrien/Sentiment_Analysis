I only really found two problems with the movie. One they made Arwen seem like a main character, and two is that they left out the part with Tom Bombadil. Other than that the only thing I could see wrong is that they left out some parts or changed some parts, but that is to be expected of any movie that is made after a book. I thought the costumes and the people who they chose for the characters were very good. And they did follow the basic plot line.
