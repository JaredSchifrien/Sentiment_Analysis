After seeing this movie in the theatre I knew that I had to own it. This movie had it all action, romance and even a little bit of history rolled into a story of betrayal and revenge. One of the most memorable performances was the one that Richard Harris gave as The Priest . The character was light hearted but still inspired a broken Edmund Dantes to not give up in life and never lose hope.
