Easily superior to the original, Shrek 2 is a comic tour-de-force. There are a plethora of theatrical and televisionic references from Godzilla to The Price is Right and even Lord of the Rings. There's also some other forms of delightfully silly and chipper humor. The animation is even better, with the trees looking darn near realistic. The voice acting is solid across the board, but Antonio Banderas's Puss-in-Boots truly steals the show. Also, Jennifer Saunders as the Fairy Godmother is hilarious. Even the musical sequences are enjoyably fast-paced and upbeat and backed up with great gags and more.
