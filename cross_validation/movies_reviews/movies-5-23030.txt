When I went to see Spiderman it had only been released a couple of days. It was very crowded and it seemed to me that the theater was filled with two very different groups of people. Half the crowd had never read a Spiderman comic book, and knew absolutely nothing about the characters. The other half knew way too much about Spidey to be healthy. Before the movie started I said to my wife that one half of the audience or the other would have to be disappointed. If it were deep enough to impress the experts it would be way over the heads of the novices. I could not have been more wrong. The whole audience was entertained and everyone enjoyed it. The movie is about 90% true to the comic book. I remember seeing this movie advertised in theaters before the September attacks. In those early promos they showed an amazing scene where Spiderman spun a web between the Twin Towers and caught a helicopter. After the attacks, the movie's release was held up and all scenes of the Towers were removed. Some day, in the future, when the wounds heal, I would like to see the original version and compare it to what was released.
