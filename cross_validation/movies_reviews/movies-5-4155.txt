I watched it not that long ago and it seemed like there were a lot of weird scenes. Sometimes it is a little scary, like when Willy Wonka takes them through that dark tunnel and all these werid things are flashing by. There was even a quick shot of a chicken stuggling. It is pretty weird when you watch it now. You don't notice those things when you are a kid.
