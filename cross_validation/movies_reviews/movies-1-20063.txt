This movie kept me on the edge of my seat.... waiting for something to happen. It never did. The dialog consisted mostly of the F word, used once every 10.44 seconds. I learned that, even I could be offended by this language when exposed to it long enough. Basically, if you take 11 seconds out of the center of the movie and put it in a continuous play loop, you've got the whole thing. Stupid dialog about 3 stupid people who go into the woods with a map they can't read and a compass they don't know how to use. They have no survival skills whatsoever. Any ordinary person threatened by a 'whatever-it-was' would hopefully sharpen a couple branches and make a spear or dagger, or fashion some kind of weapon. And what's up with all the filming while they're 'running for their lives'? I don't mean to pick on the lack of realism because this is fiction, but these people were so moronic that I was actually cheering for the 'whatever-it-was' to get them so they couldn't eventually reproduce. I understand what this movie was trying to accomplish; fear of the unknown. It missed the mark by a mile. It could have worked, but it didn't. It was boring, repetitive, had dialog consisting almost entirely of F--- and left me with a burning desire to call my Congressman and demand more funding for education. I hope the $30,000 cost for this movie was spent on expensive lunches. Otherwise, it was wasted.
