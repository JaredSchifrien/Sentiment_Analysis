This movie is a classic for all the reasons brought out by the other reviewers. What I most liked about it, however, is.. first, the almost dreamy mood created by the dialogue, lighting, and editing. You feel the quiet desperation of these people. And secondly, I like the stark, crisp beauty of the black & white photography.
