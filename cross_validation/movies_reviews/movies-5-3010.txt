Great movie! I saw it in the theater and it was a wonderful experience, except for the strange guy sitting next to me, trying to make me sip from his Icee. . .anyway, it is a tense, well-written movie that keeps you guessing. Even when you know, really know, who the killer is, it's suspenseful and raw. Awesome movie. Definitely suggest it!
