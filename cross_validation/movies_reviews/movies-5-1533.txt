What a great action movie. Lethal Weapon modernized the classic buddy picture (e.g., Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) and ushered in a host of imitators that also pair up unlikely male buddies of different races (Rush Hour, Last Boy Scout, Wild Wild West, just to name a few). But the imitators can't match the Mel Gibson/Danny Glover chemistry that drives the movie and makes you care about the characters. Lethal Weapon has great action scenes, great dialogue, and better acting than you'll find in most action movies.
