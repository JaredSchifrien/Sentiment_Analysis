Now this deserved more than one Oscar. It perfectly created the atmosphere of 19th century New York, touched on several haunting themes, and overall had a much greater affect on you than Chicago. Martin Scorsese is a pretty incredible, hard-hitting (pun intended) director who frankly deserves a bit more respect in Hollywood than he currently gets.
