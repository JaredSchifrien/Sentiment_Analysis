About a half an hour into the movie it abandons any notion of plot in the battle of Zion. Its an hour of explosions, debris, and screaming. It was absolutly wonderful.From Neo's crucifix pose to the Oracle in the end of the movie the religious backround of the movie is also more obvious. If youre a hardcore fan of the Matrix you WILL like this movie. The wierd thing is this movie isn't even the best in the Trilogy. I could type a hang of a lot more about this movie but just go see it.
