This is the best movie I have seen that I will never watch again. I was so scared after this that for weeks I had to turn every light on when I walked through the house. I was living with my mom and her husband and on the walls were pictures of his family, so from those old pictures of the 20's where they were farmers and didn't smile. I just had a creepy feeling that I would bump into them.I loved the suprise ending that I had no clue of until the wife dropped the wedding band. I was pobably still crying when we were driving home from the theatre.
