I absolutely loved this movie. There were no extreme high dramatic moments which is exactly what Sophia Coppolla was trying to capture. How I related to this movie was being in a strange place, where you feel extremely out of place and out of time. You can't relate to anyone there and the person who you thought you could relate to seems like a total stranger. If Bill Murrays character and Scarlett Johansson's character were at home they would probably never connect, but both characters met half-way due to their vulnerability and no connection with the outside world.
