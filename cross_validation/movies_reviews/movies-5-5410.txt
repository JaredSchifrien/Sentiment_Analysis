This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Our family watches this every year at Christmas.A tradition for us.I love the story of a man who has always given up his dreams to help others. He goes through a crisis and thinks about ending his life . and down comes Clarence the angel.He shows George what life would have been like for others if he had never been born.George finds how important he is to those around him and decides he wants to live. the very last scene where the town rallies around for George is still a tearjerker. I love feel good movies and this is a good one. James Stewart is perfect as George Bailey.the other actors are fine too.
