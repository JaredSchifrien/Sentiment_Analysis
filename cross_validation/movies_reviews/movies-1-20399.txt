. . . I don't even know where to begin. It was so bad that if they make a sequel, I'll protest. This is the absolute WORST movie I've ever seen (to be fair, I haven't seen Gigli ). I liked the video game, so I gave this movie a chance. There were SO many things wrong with this movie. Where can I begin . . . 1) They automatically assume that a bunch of teenagers who have never touched a gun in their life can become expert at the use of semi automatic weapons and be able to handle the recoil upon picking one up. 2) Gratuitous breast exposure should be at least limited to less than 3 times in a ten-minute span, unless it's a pornographic film. 3) Why is the 15th-century captain's log typed and bound in leather? Or did the captain just have really good handwriting to write in Times New Roman, 12 point? 4) Of course all Asian girls know martial arts and is so in love with America that they'd wear a tacky outfit of the US flag, I do that all the time . . . seriously, what were they thinking? And that's just the beginning of my rant. I can't believe that someone had to first, conceive this idea, THEN think that this was a GOOD idea, THEN find someone else who thought it was a good idea to make the film. One person who walked out of the theater made a perfect comment: It was so bad I was TRYING to fall asleep .
