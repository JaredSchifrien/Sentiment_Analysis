This deserves zero stars and three additional turkeys. Now, I shall sheepishly admit that I read a couple of the Anne Rice vampire potboilers to see what all the hype was about. Therefore I knew who Lestat was, but since I didn't read the book that this bow-wow is based upon, I was totally lost. I go to a used video store once in a while to shop for bargain dvd's and this chestnut is always in the cheapo bin. That should tell you something.
