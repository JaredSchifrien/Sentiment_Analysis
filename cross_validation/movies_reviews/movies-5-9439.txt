My favorite comedy ever. I can't count the number of times I've watched it (I own it). Best scene: Tootsie is trying to hail a cab to take her, late already, to her first day of work. Taxis streak by, igoring her meek little lady voice, until squeeling breaks are heard after the middle-aged women yells out TAXI! in a very low man's voice. Cracks me up every single time.
