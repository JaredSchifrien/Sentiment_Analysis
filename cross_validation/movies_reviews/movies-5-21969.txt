I thought I would never find anybody who didn't love this movie but then came my brother-in-law I guess he just doesn't like fairy tales. If you require intense serious dialogue and plot schemes this isn't the movie for you. However if you have an imagination and are young at heart you would think this was one of the top ten movies you've ever seen. Swashbuckling, pirates, R.O.U.S., a beautiful princess, a witty hero, a dispicable villian, revenge, Peter Falk, highly quotable lines. What more can you ask for in a movie. How anybody could give this movie less than five stars is INCONCEIVABLE!!!
