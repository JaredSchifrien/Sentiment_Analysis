How can this rate higher than the 1974 original? Have fans of this remake even SEEN the 1974 version? That version is a drive-in classic, a real product of its time----graphic without being in-your-face, gritty, darkly funny, beautifully shot and edited. The viewer actually feels "dirty" after watching it. The remake is none of the above--just exploitation. Heck, I'll take the Renee Zellweger "remake" from 1994 over this thing.
