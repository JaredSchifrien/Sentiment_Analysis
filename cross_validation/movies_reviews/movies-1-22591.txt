t3 was a joke. Did they writers even watch the first two movies?? They butchered the storyline, and ruined the trilogy. The previous movies were serious, with some comedy...this was a comedy with bad graphics. Graphics are suppose to make things LOOK more real, not totally abstract. (see T2 idiots) I think T2 graphics were much better....and the sound....bad sound....what happened to NO FATE BUT WHAT WE MAKE....the future isn't written???? then why the hell does J Conner have a solemate. What a joke. This isn't another stupid chosen one movie, where the he is destined to glory, he just happens to be the one who saves the day in the end. He isn't a jesus figure....writters took stuff from the Matrix storyline and thrusted it into a much more complex story. T1 and T2 had a story, a good story, with significant action scenes and a plot. YES, PLOT. The amount of crap that was shoved into T3 complicated the movie, I don't even know exactly what happened. People don't need none stop action, T2 fans liked the story, not just effects. AND, the effects were actually good, not a joke. I still don't know how SKYNET was built despite the work of Dyson In short, T3 was a comedy, with no story, no acting, no sound , and no legitimate connection to the previous movies. I have so much respect for James Cameron that I never knew.
