Wow is this a depressing movie. Sometimes you want get bummed out, and this is just the movie to do it. I remember hearing that this was X rated when it won Best Picture in 1969 or so. Its tough to imagine why it got that rating. I can only imagine how disappointing some rowdy young adults were when they went to see an adult movie and got this heart wrenching arty drama instead. Kinda like when Bart Simpson's pals were headed off to see an R rated movie, chanting Bar-ton-Fink! Bar-ton-Fink! , not knowing what was in store for them....
