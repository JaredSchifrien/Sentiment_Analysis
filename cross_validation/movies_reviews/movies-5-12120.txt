I would normally give this one 4 stars, but I'm giving 5 because everyone else seems to be bashing it so badly. I liked it. I can see though how some fundamentalist types might be upset by the Dantean-Catholic-newage vision of the heaven/hell mythos. The thing that was funniest to me at the time was the running gag about how saintly Henry Winkler was! I remember Henry as the badass Fonzie in Happy Days anyone else old enough to remember the contreversy about that character? How times have changed!
