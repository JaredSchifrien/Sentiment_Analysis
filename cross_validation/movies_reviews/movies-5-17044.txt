even though i beleive this movie is a 4, i give it a five to balance out those who disliked it, thus bolstering the grade a little bit. :) I thought it was fairly interesting concept that was somewhat predictable. I liked the idea that would prove that innocent men and women get put to death each year by the state and how that really doesn't matter to those who are in charge. There was many anarchist measages in the movie which i found pleasing. (by this i mean real anarchist, not the stuff those in charge like to scare little kids with) Most people i don't think picked up on that as well. Enough with the praise, now for what i didn't like. Kate seemed to breka into tears every few seconds even though the first time was really understandable. The character of David gale started off as some one you could almost like, but then he slips into blandhood which means by the end you really almost don't care what happens to him. This i chalk up to bad writting because kevin does a good job of trying to save the heart of the character.
