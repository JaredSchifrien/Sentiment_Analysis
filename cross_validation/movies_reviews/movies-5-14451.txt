Along with Remember The Titans , this has got to be the best sports movie of all time. Gene Hackman as always gave a great performance, as did Dennis Hopper as the drunk basketball fanatic who badly wants to get his life together, but can't seem to get his mind off the bottle. Its so surprising to me that this emotional story is actually true- its very rare espescially today to find anyone so dedicated to their job as Gene Hackman's character and his team was.
