An excellent movie about an American who takes a trip to England and gets turned into a werewolf, and the action never really seemed to stop. One of the few werewolf movies out there that is actually excellent. All the actors did an excellent job and I would even almost go as far as saying there were some Oscar worthy performances going on...EXCELLENT ! A must see if you haven't already.
