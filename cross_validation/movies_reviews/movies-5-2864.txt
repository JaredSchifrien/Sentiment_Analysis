This movie was an action-packed film that kept me interested throughout.Halle Berry was cool and so was Pierce Brosnan(who happens to be as smooth as ever and a womanizer).I agree with the opinionater down below who said Madonna's drab theme music was bad.I personally think they should stick with the orchestras.
