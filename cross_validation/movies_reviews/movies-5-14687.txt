This movie is in my top 10 greatest movies of all time. I loved the drama this movie had ! The ending made me feel great, too. Erin is definately someone to look up to in this world. There are so few like her left anymore. This movie was also the first movie made by Julia Roberts that was good. I never thought that day would come.
