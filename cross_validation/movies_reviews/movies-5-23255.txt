I loved this movie as a child, and I still love it today. I find this to be a perfect scary movie for kids. It has enough moments to keep them gasping, without there being anything to really give them nightmares. The Skeksies (sp?) were very creepy, but the gelflings were neat enough to make up for it. The story was great, too. This is a must see if you have children, one of Henson's best!
