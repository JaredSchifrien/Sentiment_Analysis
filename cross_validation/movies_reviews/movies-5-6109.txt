I would put Ben-Hur in my top 15. The movie was incredible, particularly the chariot race and the scene with the slaves rowing the ship faster and faster. However, I did not like the ending. I feel that the end (spoiler coming up) made a pro-religious statement. By curing everyone, the movie said that Jesus was the son of God and could magically cure people. Before this, the movie portrayed Jesus as a great guy but did not make a religious statement. At the latest, I would have ended the film, if I were William Wyler, when Judah gave water to Jesus. That was a powerful moment.
