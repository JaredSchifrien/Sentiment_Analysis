Thoroughly enjoyed Anchorman. Will Ferrell is on a hot streak. Old School and Elf were good movies, but Ferrell's portrayal of Ron Burgundy kept me in stitches throughout the flick. The movie did a great job in placing you in the 1970s (unlike the awful That '70s Show, which has no clue on what the '70s or humor is). It also captures the soul of San Diego, though some of the backdrops of the city were of recent vintage and were kind of an anachronism. The love/hate/love relationship of Burgundy and co/rival anchorwoman Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate looks great) is a riot. But the real hilarious stuff occurs with Burgundy's downright insane on-scene reporter, sports guy, and weatherman. The fight scene between Burgundy's crew and the rival station news teams (watch for A-List cameos) was one of the funniest fight scenes ever staged. The DVD has a ton of special features. Ferrell's music video of Afternoon Delight is spit your food out funny.
