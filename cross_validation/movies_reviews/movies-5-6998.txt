A movie that you can watch over and over again and never get bored. You just can't help but be drawn in by Ferris's unique charm. He's the guy that we all want to be. I thought that Matthew Broderick played the role perfectly, and what a hilarious performance by Jeffrey Jones. I never get bored watching this movie, and if I ever see it on when I'm just browsing the channels, I'll watch it despite the countless times I've seen it before. The movie's blatant sarcasm is what I like best about it.
