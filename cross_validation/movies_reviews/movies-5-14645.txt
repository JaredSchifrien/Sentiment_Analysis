I loved this movie....It has been put onto my fave list. If you like movies that have romance and dreams coming true this is a movie to watch..the acting by the guy who played Cooper wasn't that great but other than that the movie was good. I loved the plot and Amanda-Jody was awsome. This movie helped me see that with hard work even I can achieve my dreams...I LOVED IT.
