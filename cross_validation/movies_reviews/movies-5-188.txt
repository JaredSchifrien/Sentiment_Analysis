Excellent movie. This one definitely makes my A list. The scenery is beautifully dressed. The story of William Wallace is legendary in its telling, and the battle scenes are magnificent. If you have not had a chance to rent this movie, do so. You will not be disappointed. I recommend a DVD set to wide screen mode.
