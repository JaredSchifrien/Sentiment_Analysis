A very powerful movie. NOT for the young. It doesn't pull any punches when it comes to the way skinheads and the neo-Nazi's in the country spread their hate. This film is about a skinhead who goes to prison for killing a black guy. While in prison his younger brother gets involved with the skinheads. When he gets out of prison the older brother (Ed Norton) trys to get him away from that. He's been rehabilitated. I've watched it 3 times and the ending still gets to me. A must see for anyone over 14. I'd advise young people to see it with an adult, preferably their parent if they can. It's a pretty strong movie. Ed Norton has to be one of the best actors of our time.
