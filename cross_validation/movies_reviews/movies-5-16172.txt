This one gets five stars becuase it's about the best period flick I've seen in some time. Very colourful, believable and very interesting to see a parallel of our own colonial history in the U.S. I'm not a Leonardo Di Caprio fan in the slightest, but I think even he did a good job - in this particular role. But I the two actors who made the film for me was Daniel Day Lewis and Liam Neeson.
