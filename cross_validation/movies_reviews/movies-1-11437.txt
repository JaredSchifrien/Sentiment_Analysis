Within the last year this film has garnished praise from countless critics as the best thing for Indie films since sliced bread. So I went to the film confident it would at least be decent, but to my disappointment, my wife and I could barely sit through the thing. A few adjectives that quickly come to mind: dull, empty, juvenile, shallow, meaningless, self-indulgent, meanduring and pretentious. It wasn't like I was trying to learn the meaning of life by going to see this, but I simply found it incredibly unfunny and completely full of itself...the whole time I felt like I was on a hipster twenty-something MTV filmset watching them pretend to shoot a film, rather than a typical film experience. What a waste of 16 bucks.
