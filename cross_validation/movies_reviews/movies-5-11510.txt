I must admit that i am a fan of the original and did think that the second could not be as good, but they pulled it off very successfully. I've read the other comments on this movie and find that if anyone had watched the original they would absolutely love this and if you hated the original and its sex jokes don't watch this one. Howeverm with the crazy antics that Jim and his pals get up to will leave you laughing so hard and even has a cheesy love sentiment about it (for you romantic types). All actors pull off their performances with wit and consistency. This is a film to be enjoyed by any teenager, just don't take (what one person noted - the 'mocking' of modern teenagers) seriously. It's all in good fun and will make you laugh all over again.
