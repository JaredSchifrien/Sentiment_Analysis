This movie is great! Scary and funny. Laughs at itself and other horror movies. The main character, Sydney, is smart. Her boyfriend not only doesn't save her, he's one of the two killers. The characters were believable, I find myself rooting for them and being amazed at the death methods- decapitated by a garage door- whoah!
