I really think that Nick Parks is a master of masters in the specialized world of puppet animation, and even though he did not personally move the puppets around in this, his first feature film, his eye for detail and his dry Brit humor rings through. I saw a sneak screening and when the movie was over I hid in the bathroom and snuck in with the next audience just to see it again.
