More complex enjoyment from Mr. Gilliam. This one had a better cast than TIME BANDITS, and you could see the director letting them loose on occasion. You almost caught yourself reading the movie, as its fairy-tale sets and effects evoked a child-like wonderment all about. Dream-like in places, I get a kick out of it every time I see it.
