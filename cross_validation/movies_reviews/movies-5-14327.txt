A very good film, a retired Jewish school teacher in the south with a black man that her son hired to drive her because she was to old to drive herself. It brought up bigotry, illiteracy, ageing, all kinds of issues but most in a pretty subtle fashion. The relationship between the driver, Morgan Fairchild and the teacher, Jessica Tandy changes throughout the movie.
