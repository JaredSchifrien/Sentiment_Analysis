A truly excellent movie from Disney. Mixing slick direction, great acting, an excellent and fascinating plot with great humor, this movie is a success from beginning to end. The plot and the progression of that plot is quite interesting and includes several great twists. Nicolas Cage leads an excellent cast which also includes Christoper Plummer and Jon Voight. I also love the pro-democracy vibe such as when Nicolas Cage looks in awe at a particular line that basically boils down to whoever has the power to do what is right has the responsibility to DO what is right. That's so true! Also, the ending is definately MY kind of ending!
