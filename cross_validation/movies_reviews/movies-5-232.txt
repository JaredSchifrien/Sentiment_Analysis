This film started a highly emotionally charged, long running sexual affair. The theme of the soundtrack alone is still enough to send shivers up any spine. Easily confused with Rob Roy for anyone who has no real knowledge of Scotland, and definitely preferred by those who like to revel in their fantasies. Well scored battle scenes.
