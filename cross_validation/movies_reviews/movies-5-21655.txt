It's always a battle between this and Empire for being the second best Star Wars. This also had an excellent score and amazing special effects like the other two. It has a wonderful end to the Star Wars trilogy. Plus those Ewoks are amusing and the explosion of the death star is incredible. An absolute triumph in film history. Got To LOVE it!
