Macho with a soft side, whodunit with a quality story, pathos and some good action scenes, though it's not action the whole way through. Sweet goodytwoshoes lady in Detroit took in numerous foster children through the years but actually adopted four of them that were in unique ways unadoptable/degenerates. Anyway, years later she is shot, prompting her four now adult sons to reunite and seek out the truth about the shooting. Recognized most of the actors, though can't recall names, except Mark Wahlberg (one of brothers) and Terrance Howard (one of cops on case). Motown soundtrack. I think most everyone would enjoy this never boring good-vs-evil redemption movie, though some bad language and a bit of violence and sexual explicitness.
