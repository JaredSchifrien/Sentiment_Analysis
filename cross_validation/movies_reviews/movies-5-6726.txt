This is my absolute favorite of James Dean s three films. His magnificent portrayal of the disturbed twin Cal is so deeply compelling and believable I actually ached for him. His need to gain acceptance and love from his parents (wonderfully played by Raymond Massey and Jo Van Fleet) is a universal theme, which nearly anyone can identify with and it pulls the viewer in from the start. The brief but sweet love story between Cal and Abra (Julie Harris) is extremely moving and one of the most intense I have ever seen depicted on screen. Dean conveys more feeling and passion in their one kiss on the Ferris Wheel than a dozen more graphic scenes ever could. This movie posses a very winning combination of great directing, writing and a stellar cast with the remarkable ability to create timeless characters. All these winning points combine to provide a rare opportunity to enter and experience an excellent piece of classic literature.
