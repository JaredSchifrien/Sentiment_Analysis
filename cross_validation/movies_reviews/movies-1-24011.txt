I think this movie (like Eyes Wide Shut) is a case of The Emperor's New Clothes with those desperate to accepted, by the psuedo-intellectual Wanna-Bee's repeating ridiculous comments; Wonderous, Brilliant, etc. BLECHHHH!!!!! This film was TOO long and boring, there was no point to it. No story, the kid/robot was extremely creepy and I would have had him destroyed. The real kid was dying of a virus and is up and around within ten minutes?!?! The husband brought the thing home and then hates it?!?! None of it made any sense. Alien/Robots?! A Fairy Statue that after two thousand years looks to have been painted that day?! In fact, the entire movie was stupid and our opinion of Mr. Spielberg has dropped considerably. Definitely the WORST Movie That Spielberg has EVER been associated with. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!!
