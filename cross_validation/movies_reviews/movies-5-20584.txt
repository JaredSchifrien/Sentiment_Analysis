I did this one (off Broadway) so I am partial. I love the music and dancing . I would have voted this my favorite musical until Moulin Rouge came along. Natalie Wood did a wonderful acting part but why couldn't they get a real singer/actress to do the lead role instead of the obvious dubbing of Ms. Wood's voice
