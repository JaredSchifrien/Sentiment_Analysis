I found this film to be a disappointment. This is measured not only in MY view of the film, but also that of my two daughters who found it quite lackluster. There was entirely too much adult (sex) humour for a film directed at kids. I personally don't care for the lowest common denominator humour: gee, the bear has gas and his poop stinks. Har Har Har. It was bad enough directing away question about what is oral sex thanks to Bill Clinton, now I have a kid asking what an Action Shot is. I guess after Klumps I should have known what to expect; heck, from Eddie's early comedy act I should have known what to expect. The movie is slow, the humour is weak, and the there is nothing that makes you really care what happens. Sorry, Baaaaad movie.
