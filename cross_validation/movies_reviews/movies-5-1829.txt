This movie would have long been forgotten if it wasn't for Bruce Lee. His screen presence, power and stunning physique make this movie worth watching..and Williams massive fro. There is no way Roper could beat Bolo! Things to wtach out for: 1. Hans terribly dubbed voice 2. Williams impressive fro. 3. The "art of fighting without fighting" scene. 4. "Bull*** Mr. Han-Man!" 5. Jackie Chan getting his neck snapped by the master in the underground lair scene. 6. "The battle with the guards was EXTRA-ordinary!" 7. Bruce Lee delivering a massive kick to Han's head.
