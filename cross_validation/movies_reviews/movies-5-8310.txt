This movie's special edition DVD -- looking for all the world like a slim, leather-bound bible -- has a place of honor on my shelf next to other classics of religious subversity. (Includes Last Temptation of Christ and MP's Life of Brian. ) People can sit there and get offended all they want by it, but beneath the *# $ monster, the cruder jokes, and the general insanity is a plethora of deep insight into the nature of all religions, not just Catholicism. This movie is so good that even the end credits are good, with an Alanis M song that I like (the verses seem to be those that God would use, too), and a list of authors that inspired this work that everyone should look into for further insight on what this movie was trying to get across.
