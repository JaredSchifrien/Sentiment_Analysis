This movie was excellent. Very intriguing story of this mathematical genius with a profound life-debilitating illness. I was fascinated with how his delusions were made to seem so real. I know someone personally affected by schizophrenia and this movie opened my eyes a little more about how the victims lives are taken over by their imaginings. The movie truly touched me, I shed a tear. Russell Crowe is an excellent actor.
