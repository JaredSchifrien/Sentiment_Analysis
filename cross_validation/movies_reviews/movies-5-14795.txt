The thing I like about Sergio Leone is that when watching his movies,and especially this one, you have the feeling that he holds nothing back in terms of reality.I mean, this man would be capable of showing s**t in his movies,if it serves a artistic purpose.But it is not realistic a la news,it is also full of poetry,feelings,imagery.This combo between gritty realism and feelings is mastered uniquely by Leone.As for the actors...LOVED every performance.Even the very small roles were excellent.1 last word: WOW!
