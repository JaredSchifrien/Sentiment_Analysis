For those of us who regularly watch Disney movies (my brother loves them, so every time I new one comes out, I see it), we got totally spoiled with a string of really great ones. This was the last of that string. Finally, we get a Disney heroin who actually does something besides look beautiful, get kidnapped or put to sleep or whatever, and get rescued by some man. It was well-made, had some very memorable music, and had it's share of laughs. The kids will love it, and most of the adults I know enjoyed it, too. Take care, everyone!
