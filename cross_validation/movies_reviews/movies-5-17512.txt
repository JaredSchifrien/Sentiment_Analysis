 Wings of Desire is one of the most beautiful, thought provoking films ever made. From the very first scene Wenders illustrates a world of isolation and connection, of the fallen and the saved, a wonderful journey through what it means to be human, mortal. The cinematography is outstanding. This film touched me so deeply and became and instant classic for me. This film is about love, the love of life and the love of others. This film will make you look around yourself and feel differently about your existence. It's that good.
