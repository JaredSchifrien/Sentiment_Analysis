I was very surprised when Todo sobre mi madre won the European Film Awards '99, not only for best actress, but also best film! I was quite sure either F...... m l [Show Me Love], Mifunes sidste sang or Nothing Hill would win! It's said that this film is Pedro Almodovar's best, his true masterpiece! But it doesn'tstop there: The movie is ranked as the 100. best of the IMDb users! And the ranking: 8.7 out of 10. To have something to compare to, the leader of IMDb's Top 250, The Godfather is ranked 9.0 out of 10... Finally, the world has a chance to see a Spanish movie, a language 500 million people talk! Tonight it's a fact: It won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film! :o)
