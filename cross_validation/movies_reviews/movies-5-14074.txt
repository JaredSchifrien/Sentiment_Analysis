This is my all time favorite movie. Every minute of it was great, I didn't even mind his annoying hippie wife. Even Costner acted with a little personality, and Lioatta did a great job of playing Joe. Lancaster was great, everyone was. This story brought a tear to my eye more than once. I remember the first time I saw it on USA, I was moved like I never was moved before. Before I saw this, I didn't think I could be emotionally effected by movies. I was very, very wrong.
