Boring Much? I really wanted to like this film but I just kept getting more and more annoyed. I didn't really have any sympathy for this whiny bunch of rich folks and I didn't become engaged in the story at all. I thought Richard Gere's character was pretty vacant and for a film with so many familiar names on the marquee, this film was totally unremarkable. I think that Altman is an acquired taste anyway but I can usually get into the flow of his films. This one left me hanging, waiting for a punchline, a tragedy, something to liven up this lifeless excuse for a movie.
