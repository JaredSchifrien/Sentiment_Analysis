 CARRIE WAS THE FIRST HORROR FILM I EVER SAW AND I STILL THINK,DESPITE IT`S AGE THAT IT IS THE ULTIMATE HORROR SHOCKER IT HAS GOOD DIRECTION,A GREAT CAST AND SOME OF THE GREAT SHOCK MOMENTS IN ALL OF HORROR. IT ALSO HAS ONE OF HORRORS BEST EVER SCORES WRITTEN BY PINO DONAGGIO PLAYING THROUGHOUT. ALL IN ALL UNMISSABLE.....
