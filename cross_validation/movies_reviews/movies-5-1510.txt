Based on the graphic novel by James O'Barr with the same title. The film really lived up to the graphic novel and its brilliant to watch with all the gothic imagery and simplistic camera work. The premise of the film is simple - if a love is pure it will never die which is reflected when Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) returns from the dead one year after his and his fiancees deaths on devils night. Eric seeks revenge on the persons responsible for their deaths and one by one kills off the criminals by their own trademark which leads up to a fantastic sequence between him and the big boss who ordered the deaths. It was tragic that this was Brandon Lee's last film - but that makes it even more special to watch as you get to see him in a spectacular film.
