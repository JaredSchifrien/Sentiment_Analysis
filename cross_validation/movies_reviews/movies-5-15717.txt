I've seen this movie three times and will see it again. It's one of the best modern movies I've ever seen. It's a rather long movie, but you won't care Michael Mann manages to hold your attention. It has a superb cast with Russell Crowe, Al Pacino and Christopher Plummer. The movie is about Dr Jeffrey Wigand and the controversial 60 minutes episode regarding the tobacco industry. Pacino is terrific as Lowell Bergman, the 60 minutes producer and Plummer is outstanding as Mike Wallace. The movie is edgy, tense and powerful.
