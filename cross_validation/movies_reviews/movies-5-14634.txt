One of the best films I saw last year. What I liked about it is that there were no special effects or big budget hollywood studios sticking their ore in, just a movie making room for sheer entertainment. Throughout this movie the story keeps you interested, the character's are real the dialogue's convincing not to mention outstanding performances from the children to the adults. A well told story, Clint Easwood is truly a extra-ordinary story teller.
