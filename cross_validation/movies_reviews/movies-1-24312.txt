What is it with sequels never knowing when to stop, especially when large creatures are envolved. JAWS and Jurassic Park were fantastic movies, but there was absolutly no need to make more of them. The only reason I even watched this movie was because somebody was playing it in the room I was in. I never would have spent money to see this movie, and I'm glad I didn't.
