This 1952 film was one of the first to seriously tackle such issues as alcoholism and codependency in a personal way, but never in an overtly preachy or doctinaire manner. Shirley Booth won a well-deserved Oscar for her charming portrayal in this bittersweet classic, and Burt Landcaster gives a credible, noteworthy performance as her aging, jaded, battle-worn husband. Recommended.
