A film so lame that even highly unsophisticated audiences in those horrible Times Square moviehouses laughed it off the screen. A shopworn and tired premise supported by a really limp script, humdrum score and featuring one of biggest no-talents ever as its female lead. No wonder this picture bombed and set back the trumped-up and artificial career of Mariah Carey about ten years. That bimbo isn't bad to look at, but her singing reminds you of the girl at high school Talent Night who had a couple of voice lessons. All the taste and delicacy of a jackhammer, every line imposed upon by pointless and unessential vocal gymnastics. Dreadful. Who listens to this crap anyway? The only reason this no-talent ever got to the public eye is that she dropped for that idiotic T. Mottola when he was a highflyer at Sony. Maybe there's a future for her in stroke films.
