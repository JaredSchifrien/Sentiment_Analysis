 Point Break with cars instead of surfboards and bad. The acting may have been good if the actors would have had something to work with, but as it was, the BEST actors couldn't have saved this movie. Unfinished plot lines that weren't very good to begin with, lame cars and the longest 1/4 mile races I've ever seen.
