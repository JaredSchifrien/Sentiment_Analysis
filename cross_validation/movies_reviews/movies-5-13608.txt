A little simplistic in it's portrayal of rebellion and middle-class ennui, but in these times of resurgent conformity and material crassness, it's very refreshing to see a movie promote, among other things, simple joy and pleasure. The acting is fantastic. Spacey deserves the acclaim he received; Wes Bentley is also mesmerizing.
