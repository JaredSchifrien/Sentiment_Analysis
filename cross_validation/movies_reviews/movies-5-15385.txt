 Save the last Dance was absolutely 'slammin' (haha)!!! It was so excellent!! It made me wanna get up and dance myself!!!! I cried like five times.!!!!!! Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas were so good together, both they're talents complimented each other!!! One to watch if you wanna laugh and cry!!!!!
