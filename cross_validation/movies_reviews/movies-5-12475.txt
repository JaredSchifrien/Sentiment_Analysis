Wonderously delicious! Something for everyone. Kids will love the visuals and the fantasy-like storytelling. Adults will love the cultural in-jokes, dark humor and Johnny Depp's hilarious deadpan delivery. I adore the Oompa Loompas (all played by the same actor) and how they pop up in different settings and costumes throughout. Their musical numbers are funny and over-the-top, especially the Esther-Williams takeoff and the heavy metal band. Freddie Highmore is a perfect choice to play Charlie Bucket, full of wide-eyed innocence and grace, a perfect foil for the charicatured kids that embody a variety of social and moral ills. Director Tim Burton is a master of creepy/cartoony scenery and this film is one of his best ever.
