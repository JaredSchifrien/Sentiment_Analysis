I gotta agree with dark. Not a very good movie at all. It promotes the idea that it is okay to abandon your buddies and friends during a time of war. It was long and it was boring. The scenary was beautiful, but I just can't get over the fact that I invested three hours of my life and $7 (US!) to watch this worthless flick. But, what can you expect from Kevin Costner, one of the most untalented, over-rated hacks of all time. He has made very little that is actually watchable.
