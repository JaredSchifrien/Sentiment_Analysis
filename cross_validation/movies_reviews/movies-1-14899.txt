Aside from one humorous scene involving a rocking chair and the occasional cute moment, this movie is not enjoyable in the slightest. The acting is too low-key and very angst-ridden. The plot is wholly uncreative, very cynical, and borders on nihilistic. The battle scenes are terribly done, and the gore factor kills them completely. And, the movie drags on for way too long. Even the historical aspects of this film cant redeem it in the slightest. Rene Auberjonios (Star Trek Deep Space Nines Odo) plays an interesting characterwho is killed. That is also not a good thing.
