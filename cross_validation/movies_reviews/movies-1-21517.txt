Total garbage. I tried as hard as I could to like this movie, but couldn't. Bad acting (Natalie Portman was awful, as was Sam Jackson). The transformation to Vader wasn't believable- in a matter of minutes Anakin goes from good to ambivilent to child killer. Stupid. And Darth Vader walking like Frankenstien? How about I've got the higher ground? WTF? Throughout the prequels people jump over each other in sword fights with no problem. My biggest complaint- the empire only existed for 18 years before a New Hope??? A New Hope made it sound like the Jedi were forgotten legends, not a goup that had only disappeared for two decades. Lame.
