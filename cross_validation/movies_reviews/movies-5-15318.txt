Saw Finding Forrester last night. What an excellent movie. No car chases, violence or sex, and yes it was predictable but that is because the movie was real. The characters made decisions and played the roles of real people not supper human, everything is perfect people. In all I thought the movie was great story telling. Several scenes could have been overplayed and overacted. The producer seemed to maintain a very tight reign on how far affects and acting played on emotion and opted to allow the story to become a participating character and fill those voids. Example, the scene where Wallace gets Forrester out of his apartment for the first time to go to a basketball game and Forrester gets lost and becomes very confused with great anxiety. This could have been over dramatized with effects, music, and human emotion building a grand suspense moment. Instead, they allow the story to remain the character and you to understand the moment not caught up in the drama. Some will not enjoy the movie simply because it is relatively flat. My enjoyment came from watching superb professionals portray their characters without the crutches of effects. Sometimes it is much harder to convince the audience you are the real character without the supporting cast of the special effects department. A great feel good movie that does not leave you emotionally rung out and exhausted at the end.
