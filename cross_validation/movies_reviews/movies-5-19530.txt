I think this movie was just really interesting. kind of hard to understand and the images of the ghosts were actually scarier than the movie itself. As far as scariness goes, my 12 year old brother watched it and said it was wack, But I think that Monk,(Tony Shalhoub) was really great in such a different role than I'm used to seeing him in.
