REturn of the Jedi, is, in my opinion, the best of the Star Wars original trilogy. All of the action, suspense, the atmosphere is just right. George Lucas can make movies, and well. There are many reasons to see the movie such as, The emperor has a larger part, the war ends, the rebels defeat the empire. There are too many reasons to list. Han gets freed, Jabba dies, and the Death Star blows up. The digitally remastered version makes the movie even better than it already is. This is a must see movie.
