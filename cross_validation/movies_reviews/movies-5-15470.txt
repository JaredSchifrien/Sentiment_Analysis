This movie was based on the prison system and how innocent people are wrongly accused. The prisoner accused of the crime was sentenced to death when his partner only got life. The one who got life was wealthy and could afford a good legal defense, while the one sentenced to death was poor and had to have council appointed for him. It shouldn't matter if you are a person who is rich or poor, if they did the crime they should pay for it.
