Interesting that the movie is listed under the comedy category. Moore brilliantly utilizes a constant change of tone and emotion to keep the viewer's attention throughout the entire movie. There is not a down-point in this cinematic masterpiece. It departs from the status quo of hit movies today, acting as an expos of America's culture of fear. Moore directed a thought-provoking film, intellectually challenging the person watching to examine the very society in which they live. The documentary-style film travels around the country, interviewing people from the surprisingly articulate Marilyn Manson to Charlton Heston and two victims of the Columbine High School massacre. Capitalizing on the themes of his book Stupid White Men, Michael Moore explores the view of African Americans as criminals and menaces to society as well as the major theme of the danger of gun violence and why it occurs more frequently in America than any other civilized country. He uses resources such as actual footage of the Columbine shooting, facts about brash, reactionary measures taken by the U.S. throughout the world in the past half-century, and newscasts from local evening news stories to amplify the point he's trying to make. Whether you agree with him or not, this film is undeniably credible and keeps you entertained throughout; it created in me at various points sentiments of anger, sadness, laughter, disbelief, and awe. That fact speaks volumes about its merits as an effective work.
