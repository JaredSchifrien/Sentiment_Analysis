This has got to be one of the best movies ever made. Tom Hanks, as always, is brilliant in this movie. Has a great suspension of disbelief. You know this couldn't be a true story, but you wish so much that it was, and believe every single thing that happens on it. This is deffinetly in my top five list of movies I've seen.
