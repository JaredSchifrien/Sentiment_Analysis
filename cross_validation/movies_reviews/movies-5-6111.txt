A masterpiece movie made of Lew Wallace story of love,belief and dedication. I have seen this movie now more than 10 times. Every time I feel I see that for the first time. Charleton Heston(Judah Benhur)does a splendid leading role and Stephen Boyd makes an excellent supporting role. Those 20 minutes of Chariot race will put everybody on the edge of their seat.I think this will be one of the all time great biblical theme movie in big screens.
