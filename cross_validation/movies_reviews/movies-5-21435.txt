Hands down, my favorite series of movies of all time. I happen to prefer The Empire Strikes Back, but that's probably because it was the first one I saw in the theater (when I was barely 5 years old). This has all of the elements of a great story and its characters come across as real, unlike the new prequels. The special effects were stunning for the time - and still are. The restored version (not the updated, expanded version) is amazing. It blows away any of the new CG graphics for its realism and believability. If you can't find it in your heart to at least enjoy Star Wars, I believe you have no soul.
