I really couldn't think of a better way to close this trilogy. Most of the questions introduced in the film were answered in the end, and I honestly was shocked with the ending. Revealing Roman as the mastermind behind the events of the entire trilogy was quite clever. I was also very impressed with the writing of Erin Kruger, who really did a great job of closing the trilogy, although his writing style seems to conflict with that of Kevin Williamson. Parker Posey was hilarious in this film as Jennifer. One part I did not like which was a bit far fetched was the lame appearance by Randy which was simply put in to appease his character's fan club. Overall, a very good movie.
