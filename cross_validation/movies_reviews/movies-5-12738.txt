Wow--this documentary is well-researched and enlightening. Only the extreme right would hate it, because it violates what they believe: The rich corporations should get away with anything and everything, at the costs of the environment, animals, consumers, stock holders, and society as a whole. I will only drink soy milk or organic milk as a result of watching this. See this movie--and be prepared to get angry and demand changes. One of the most telling things about this movie is how it dissects modern corporate behavior and compares its attributes to that of a psychopath. Grim stuff---essential viewing!
