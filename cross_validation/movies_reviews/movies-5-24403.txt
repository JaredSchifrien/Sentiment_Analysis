I just finished studying the theory of Evolution in my Earth Science class. I found this movie to be pretty funny although it doesn't quite relate to the actual scientific theory of Evolution. You have to give credit to the actors(actress) for portraying the characters in comic roles. Plus what more could you ask from a movie, David Duchovny, Orlando Jones, Sean William Scott, and Julie Ann Moore. To see such awsome actors(actress) in the same movie is a rare sight. This is one of the only movies that has that.
