Excellent film, incredible story of triumph and overcoming just unbelieveable odds. So many uplifting and inspiring moments. It's one of those films where (and I know a lot of films have these but I'm still going to note it) this guy is pushed down and pushed around and seen as nothing for so long and then he's starts coming around and becomes recognized for the skill he has and you just feel really good. When his father carries him into the pub for a beer I think I saw my friend shed a tear (he's kind of a Sally).
