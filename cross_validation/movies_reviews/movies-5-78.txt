One of the best action movies of all time. I distinctly remember seeing Raiders of the Lost Ark in the theater. I hadn't heard anything about it, so I had no expectations. And the movie opened up with that great scene where Indiana Jones uses his whip, then it led right into that classic scene where Jones tries to steal the idol and has to run through all the traps while a huge granite ball is rolling behind him. All in the first ten minutes of the movie! I remember thinking that if the first ten minutes were that amazing, how great is it that I have the entire movie in front of me? And the rest of the movie didn't disappoint. The story is compelling, the Indiana Jones character is great (perfectly played by Harrison Ford), the action is extremely well-done and exciting, and it manages to be funny, too. I'm guessing almost every adult has already seen this movie, but if you haven't - what are you waiting for?
