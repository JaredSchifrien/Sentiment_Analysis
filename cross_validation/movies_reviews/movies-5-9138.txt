I'd have to disagree with some posts here--I absolutely loved this movie. It's one of Monty Python's cruder movies, and should be for ADULT audiences only, since it goes (graphically) into topics such as sex. Be forewarned that it is quite different from the other Monty Python movies, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
