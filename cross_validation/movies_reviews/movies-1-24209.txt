One of the worst movies of this decade: awful, pretentious, and incredibly dull. The speech that Nick Nolte, (playing the Hulk's sinister mad scientist father) gives near the end, and his transformation into some sort of elemental creature are so laughably ludicrous that I almost couldn't believe my eyes and ears. Avoid if at all possible!
