an intelligent film not really a horror film rather more of a thriller with alot of suspense thrown in. still it manages to scare you on a thinking level. pretty good preformances. i've only just seen this film less than a year ago and really enjoyed it. loved the brit eklund dancing scene very arousing especially if consider it from the constable's point of view with all his repression and such. nicely done scene.
