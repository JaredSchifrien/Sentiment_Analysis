 This is the movie that opened my eyes to alternative cinema. I saw this when I was in seventh grade and it blew my mind. I had never seen anything so original, so funny, so dark, so incredible in my entire life at that point. This movie opened the door to original ideas in the movie making industry. This film is one of the best independent films of our time and deserves to be recognized for the brilliant masterpeice of modern film making that it is. Superior cast. My favorite Bruce Willis character ever because it breaks his usual mold of John McClain action flicks. Highly recommended absoloutly mesmerizing. A masterpeice.
