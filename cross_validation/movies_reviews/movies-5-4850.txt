A great surprise! A non-Disney G-rated movie and its a laugh riot as well. Patrick Stewart voices the main villian, who steals parents and leaves our hero and his friends marooned on Earth. After eating too much candy and partying too much, they go into space to save the day. Highly recommended for all!
