Three words describe this movie to me - dull, dull, dull. And it was saying a lot for me to get this impression because I first saw it when I still enjoyed westerns and still didn t have a clue as to how little this folklore had to do with reality. And I especially enjoyed the ones that had a love story going on. HOWEVER, I just could not take the practically comatose subtlety of Gary Cooper s low-key acting style. He not only put me to sleep but he also looked more like Ice Princess Grace Kelley s father than her hubby. Unfortunately, unlike the western genre, this denial of masculine age and the pairing of old dudes with young chicks still persists in Hollywood. And, it still seems like exactly what it is a pathetic attempt to make the man feel and look younger. Oh, and by the way - it STILL doesn t work.
