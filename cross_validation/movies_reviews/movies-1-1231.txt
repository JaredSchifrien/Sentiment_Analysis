This is ONE of 3 movies that I have walked out of in midshow. This piece of junk should have never been created. It is senseless violence, and it really has no storyline worth mentioning. The scene of male rape was really disgusting, and it is what broke the camels back. You can believe the theatre gave our money back as we left. And we weren't the only ones. Quentin Tarantino is possibly one of the worst directors of all time as well. I do NOT recommend this senseless movie to anyone. It will leave you feeling dirty, sick and just bad if you watch it. This movie also made me lose TONS of respect for John Travolta, Rosanna Arquette and Bruce Willis...
