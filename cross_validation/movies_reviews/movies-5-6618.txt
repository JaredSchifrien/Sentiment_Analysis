The greatest of the rebellion-for-the-hell-of-it movies. A film that has influenced lives and gone down in the American lexicon as a representation of the counter-culture lifestyle. Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper in unforgettable roles, and Jack Nicholson in the film that made him a star. It has also given us one of the great film images, Nicholson and Hopper posing on the bikes while the Holy Modal Rounders' If You Want to be a Bird plays. All in all, one for the ages.
