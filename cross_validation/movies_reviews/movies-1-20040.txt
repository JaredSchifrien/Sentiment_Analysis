Out of curiosity, my mother and I rented this movie, but never expected it to be SO BAD! The directing, purposely amateurish, is supposed to invoke creepiness, but it makes Scooby-Doo look truly scary in comparison. There is way too much senseless profanity, and I've never heard any group of teenagers curse this much. The plot is extremely unclear and the teenagers look like floor-faced fools. The only good thing about this movie was that I was able to enjoy the brilliantly executed, and G-rated, parody by Cartoon Network, The Scooby Doo Project!
