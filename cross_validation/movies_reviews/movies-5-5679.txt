Love the storyline and it really is a timeless classic. Watched this movie over the weekend and I loved it just as much as the first time I saw it. The one character I don't care for is Miss Scarlet. She seemed to marry more than Elizabeth Taylor. She also was very self absorbed, seeming to crush anyone who came in her path. Love the ending when Rhett tells her where to stick it.
