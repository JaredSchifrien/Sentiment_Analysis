I don't have much to say about The Perfect Storm because I watched it for 30 minutes and then fell sound asleep. I just couldn't get into it. The characters were forgettable, and it took too long for the action to kick in. Most of the movie was shot in shadows or in the dark, which probably contributed to my sleepiness. My husband watched the whole thing, though, and he said he enjoyed it. I'll take his word for it- there's no way I'd try watching it again!
