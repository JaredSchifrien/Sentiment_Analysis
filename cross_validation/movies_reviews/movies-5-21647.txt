I have been a Tolkein fan for many, many years. You could say that his writings truly had effect on my early years. So, when I heard they were making this set of movies, I was somewhat concerned for what would come of it. The first thing most people ask me is: Did they stick to the book. I have to say NO. But they were TRUE to the book. Peter Jackson did something I would not have thought of....he told the same story from a new perspective. Instead of backtracking and flashbacks like the books, Mr. Jackson has told the story forward, in chronological order. This has the effect of telling a familiar story in a new and exciting way, and being faithful to the telling. I have never walked out of a movie with the same feeling; this movie has even replaced The Matrix in my book. It was incredible....and it wasn't NEARLY long enough!!! There is only one seen that I wish was not included, so I could feel secure taking my 12 year old to the movie. When they are calling for the Orcs from the Earth Womb , well, I think she would have nightmares for a month. The movie is expertly done, not a bit of foul language, and not gory/bloody. It is truly a moving experience.
