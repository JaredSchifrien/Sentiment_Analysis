Atually,I'm a big fan of TBWP...After watched the first TBWP,i always try to find the conclusion.I think all of you,want it too.Is that right?Suddenly, when i heard the news 'bout the next blair witch(BW 2),my heart start pushing me to buy the movie....But finally,after watching the BW 2....i felt regret... It is because the movie is sick...suck.It just wasted my money. Before buying the movie..i think that the movie will start at the Rustun Parr's house but is not.i would like to suggest that the next BW will continue from the Rustin Parr's house and make a conclusion(whatever it's true or not).Keep up a good work....
