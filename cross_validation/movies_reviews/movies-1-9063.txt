That John Belushi wannabe Chris Farley couldn't be funny even if he were a ten foot Pole! And this film is no exception. As usual, Chris Farley tries too hard. He's not a natural at anything except attempting self-exploitation... May he RIP, his career will last longer as a legend than it would've had he lived.
