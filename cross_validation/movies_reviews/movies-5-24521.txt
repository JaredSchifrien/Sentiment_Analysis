PLEASE don't ask me why I love this movie so much (after close to 120 viewings, you'd think I'd be ready to pitch it through a window!). All I know is that after checking most everything out there, THE ICE PIRATES stands up as the Mack Daddy King Mamma-Jamma of "good bad" films. It doesn't look like anything else before or after it, with herky-jerky effects, wide-ranging sets, and weirdly-lit camera work. The acting ranges from lukewarm obvious to inspired silliness (coming from a slightly-askew cast that includes Bob Urich, Ron Perlman, and Anjelica Huston). One of the few Mary Crosby vehicles out there, as well (I've always had an unhealthy obsession with Ms. Crosby; might be the hair, the crooked smile, the uneven eyes, etc.). Great supporting players in John Matuszak (who holds the honor of being in more "good bad" movies than anyone else), SEINFELD bit-character Michael D. Roberts, and the ever-annoying (but fairly funny here) Bruce Vilanch. The plot.....well, it's a basic damsel-in-distress scenario with too many continuity holes to plug in a 5000-word space. Suffice to say, it's nothing that'll bring little gold statues to one's trophy case; what it will bring is a harmless smirk to your face that lasts an hour-and-a-half. Abominable ambrosia.
