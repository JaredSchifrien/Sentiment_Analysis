Excellent puppetry! I love a good Jim Henson movie, and this is one of the better ones (I'd also like to recommend Dark Crystal, if you like Labyrinth too). The movie is also an excellent loss of innocence/coming of age story (the heroine learns that she has to be more mature and take responsibility for things as she battles the labyrinth and is tempted by the goblin king in an attempt to save her baby brother).
