Generally I've liked the King mini series on television but this one just doesn't live up to past successes like It, Salem's Lot, and to a less extent Storm of the Century. Covering familiar territory with nothing new at the table makes for uninteresting viewing. The casting on this show is weak as well (I shouldn't even notice that, but I did).
