This movie didn't hold my attention at all. As much as I had heard about the sweet, simple plot, and the gentle charachter development, I was looking forward to it. My husband watched the whole thing, but I zoned out after about 30 mins. Very slow, boring and artsy for the sake of being so. I would not recommend it.
