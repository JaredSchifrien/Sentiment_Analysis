This film is so poinient. The characters are built up beautifully and you really feel the hurt and friendship that is portrayed in the film. This must be one of the best things that Stephan King has written, its so sensitive, makes you laugh and makes you cry. Phoenix River was outstanding in this. Its hard to believe he was 16. I think he's still missed as he was a very talented actor. His younger brother Joquin is following that.
