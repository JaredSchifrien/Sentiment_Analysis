UPDATE: IAMOPINIONATED, you've got it wrong, AMERICAN PIE tries to be the updated version of this movie. And, unlike AMERICA PIE, FAST TIMES IS VERY FUNNY. It has a lot more than just Phoebe and Jennifer taking off their clothes. It gives a pretty good look into the real life of a high school student at that time. By today;s standards,it does appear to be outdated, but overall the movie still holds up. CLERKS may have surpassed it as my favorite comedy movie, yet this classic remains a close second. ---------------------------------------------My all time favorite movie. Just about every scene is a classic. If you went to High School during that time, you can find a charecter just like someone you knew. What teen-age boy couldn't relate to getting caught in a very private moment like Brad did? The book is much better than the movie, with better charecter developement, but the movie is still a clasiic that holds up well to the test of time.
