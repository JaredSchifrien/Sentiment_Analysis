One of the most charming movies to be released in a very long time. Cinderella and Ugly Duckling stories have a new treatment in this glorious celebration of Greek culture and their lovely families. Nia Vardalos and Michael Constantine shall be remembered at Oscar time...and I dare say...they will be rewarded.
