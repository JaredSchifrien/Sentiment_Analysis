One of my favorites. When I was younger I could watch this movie over and over. I haven't seen it in years but just thinking about it gives me good nostalgia. Michael Keaton was great. Contrast this character he played against the character Batman and you realize what a different sort of guy he is. I loved all the scenes when Barbara and Adam are in that waiting room there to see Juno. Some funny stuff in there. The guy with the teeny tiny little head, the swimmer with the shark eating half his body, the guy with the bone in his throat (actually that one looked pretty disgusting) and the rest. The animation was cool too. Good movie.
