i was 4 when star wars came out and my parents took me to see it when it came out, i have grown up all my life loving the star wars trilogy I AM A FAN but revenge of the sith is the best star wars movie yet, if even only for the unbelievable effects, which is why everyone in 1977 went to see this unbelivable movie it is the perfect FINAL movie for the perfect BEGINNING. p.s. i love all the star wars movies and i am praying to my yoda god to pls pls pls give us the last three. if you enjoy any star wars movies then you will love this.
