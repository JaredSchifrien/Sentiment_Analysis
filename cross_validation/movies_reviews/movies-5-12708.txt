What a great documentary!!! This film is insightful, provocative, funny, and profound all at the same time. I love how Moore makes the connection between guns and fear in the US and this fear is based on history, lack of a social safety net, and propaganda that fans the flames. I respect him for having the courage to come out and say the things that need to be said and the genius to do it in a way that combines investigative reporting, political activism, and prankster trickery.
