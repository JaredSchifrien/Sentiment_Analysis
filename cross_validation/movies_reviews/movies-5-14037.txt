This film tries and succeeds at adapting a play in which Mozart is hated by one of his contemporaries. Salieri's hatred of Mozart is never really developed well other than Mozart's arrogant slight of Salieri, but the movie does very well at chronicling the life of the composer and his relationship with both his wife and father. For anyone interested in this type of period work, it is a must see, not just for the dialogue and plot, but the music which really does make the movie.
