I don't understand those people who call fans of this series obsessed or nerds . I never even thought of Tolkein before all of this. I wasn't even into the cartoon version of his stories when I was little. In fact, I was forced by a seventh grade English teacher to even pick up The Hobbit. But something clicked in me when I saw the Fellowship last year. I never really liked fantasy stories because I couldn't grasp them, they just didn't seem real. Well, this IS real--or at least it seems that way. The characters are believable and lovable, the comedic moments are perfectly timed, the action is the kind where you gasp and squirm in the theater seats. This movie is fantastic, and it deserves every cent it earns.
