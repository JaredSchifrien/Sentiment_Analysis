Throughout this marvel of a movie I kept thinking 'this is insane,' 'there's got to be a better way'--what these penguins go through was somewhat hard to watch: as winter approaches they wobble 70 miles to thick enough ice for breeding; then after passing off eggs to males, the famished females walk the 70 miles back to sea to get food and come back to feed babies; meanwhile, males go 120 days with no food, staying huddled thru brutal, pelting ice storms; these treks go on for 9 months of the year before going back 'home' to sea; though the movie sensitively handles the dead stragglers, prey, eggs, and chicks, it will be sad for children--not that that's a bad thing; stay for closing credits to see clips of how both panoramic and close-up shots were taken. Morgan Freeman narrates.
