Romantic comedies usually don't do a thing for me, but this one is a keeper. To call it a Woody Allen-ish comedy is an insult. He never made any movies this good. Meg Ryan is especially good (and gorgeous) as Sally, and she has the best scene in the whole film, and anyone who's seen it knows exactly what I'm talking about.
