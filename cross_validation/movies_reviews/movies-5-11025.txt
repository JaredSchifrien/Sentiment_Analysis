This 1980s movie spoofs a whole lot of stuff. Weird Al was great back then. The story revolves around him buying out a crummy little television station and trying to hit it big on the air. Things get off to a very slow start but his creative ideas boost the station's success and make the you laugh. It's a great movie.
