One of the funniest and best movies I've ever seen. Only Jack Nicholson could have played the part of Melvin, anyone else would have not been funny. Helen Hunt is also great. Some of the lines in this movie are just hilarious (ex. People who talk in metaphors ought to shampoo my crotch and when he introduces Carol and Simon by saying Uh, Carol the Waitress, Simon the Fag. ) One of my favorite movies. Anyone who doesn't like this movie is either insane or has no sense of humor.
