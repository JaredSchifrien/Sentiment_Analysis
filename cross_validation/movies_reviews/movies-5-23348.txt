This runs like a really good episode of the series. Ironically, in retrospect, the gradual descent in the quality of the series can be be traced back to around this time, although this movie is one of the best X-Files stories of the 5th season/6th season era. It rather rips-off a lot of other great SF, but it doesn't dwell on it too much and goes right back into a great XF story without slipping too much. Giving Mark SNow a full-fledged orchestra was not necessarily a good idea, and so this score is not as good as his scores for the TV show. Ultimately best appreciated after seeing the major mytharc episodes of seasons 1-5.
