This is my favorite movie. Everything about it is great. It's got a very classy storyline. It is the story of the most perfect acoustic instrument ever created, as it touches the lives of hundreds of people on 3 different continents. From Italy, to Vienna, to Oxford, to China, to an auction in Montreal, this violin and its secret astonish and seduce everyone, including the viewer.
