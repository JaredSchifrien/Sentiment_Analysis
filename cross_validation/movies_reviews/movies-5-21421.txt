I will start by saying What I say here is THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH!! I have seen the original motion picture in the theaters OVER 500 times. There is a witness though I have not seen him since the release of ESB. Anyway.... This is in fact was the GREATEST motion Picture Ever made up until 1981's Empire Strikes Back. Now I am not a huge fan of Ep I, II , III looks like Mr. Lucas is reverting back to yesteryear with Story and tale telling. All those who did not care for it, I cannot fault you. IF you were not 7-12 years old when this movie first came out YOU have truly missed a great ride. Unfortunately NOW you are stuck with the likes of JAR JAR Binks.... You get the picture though...
