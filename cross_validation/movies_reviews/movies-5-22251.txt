This movie unquestionably is a classic. It redefined the movie industry, with its awesome special effects (although not like that of T2). This was Arnold's step to stardom. He was perfect as the Terminator. This movie was perfectly cast, and Linda Hamilton was exceptionally good as Sarah Connor. The directing was astounding as was the musical score.
