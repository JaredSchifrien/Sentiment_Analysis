There are many great war films out there, but Apocalypse Now is certainly the greatest of them all. Although, technically not a war film, it deals with thoughts and ideas that could only be conjurred in the act of war, thus I classify it as such. This film showcases Francis Ford Coppola's director skills, even more so than his Godfather films (although that is endlessly arguable).
