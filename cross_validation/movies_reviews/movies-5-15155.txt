I have to give this movie a five because I think Cameron Crowe has such a talent for portraying reality with such entertainment. I really appreciate Crowe's dedication to character development (something often sorely lacking in today's movies), his meticulous attention to casting actors that fit the part, and overall his natural talent for depth. With most movies, there's the hero, who's usually flawless for the most part, the supporting characters and the villains. Usually I'll only like/appreciate one or two of them, but in Jerry Maguire I just fell in love with everybody.
