This movie is fantastic! Yes it does have an adult theme running through it, but that does happen with a few things and the kids don't always pick up on it. They'll just see some adorable ants trying to save their colony and a romance occur. Some parts are heavy, but the parents should be able to deem whether it is suitable for their children or not. Personally, I love this film.
