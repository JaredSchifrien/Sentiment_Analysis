wow, i forgot cameron did this one, too. as a sequel, i'd have to say this movie couldn't be better. unfortunately, some blasphemous hacks couldn't leave well enough alone and had to do a 3 and 4. the third one wasn't quite as painful as the fourth one, though i don't know what possessed sigourney weaver to agree to either of them.
