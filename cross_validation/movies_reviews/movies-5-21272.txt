The King...The King...I mean, that's enough, but Ann-Margaret is amazing as well. She dances like a spasticated idiot but it's so much fun to watch, and the acting - it's so bad that how could you not think that it's BRILLIANCE!!!!! When he looses his money in the pool, it's so stupid it's hysterical. And you've gotta love the Forte Four singing that cheek to cheek... song. And check out the songs that didn't make it into the film like You're the boss. The King is sex.
