Great Classic with effects far in advance of their day. Still find it very watchable and moody. Forget the plot - this was the Matrix of the 50s - Man or machine - Who's the Ghost in the machine? What does it mean? Like the Matrix you will find many threads to follow and draw your your own conclusions
