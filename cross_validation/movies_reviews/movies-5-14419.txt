I really loved this movie. Almost every detail is perfect. The cast, the cinematography, the score, the costumes, and of course the script and the directing. I think Julianne and Todd are one of the greatest teams in Hollywood. It's sad that Far from Heaven didn't get as much recognization as it deserved. However it will always be one of my favorites.
