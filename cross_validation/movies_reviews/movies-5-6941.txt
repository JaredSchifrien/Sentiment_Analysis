shurley there were a lot of movies about plane truobles at the time, i was told by my mom. So some crzy guy said, F!% that, lets make a movie that people will laugh at and not worry about a plane crashin. So that guy made this movie, and it was the first to ever really put slapstick-non-stop comedy into a movie more that 50 times. So thats why this movie is great. Some up tight people wont like it but i sure as heck did, and any comedy person should too. This is a great comedy. It came out in 1977, i was born in '85, and it never gets old. And even my mom and dad cant stop watching it!!!!! oh yea and dont call me shurley!!!
