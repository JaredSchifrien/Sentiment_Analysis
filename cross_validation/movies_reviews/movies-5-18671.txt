This movie rocks!! the only flaw is it takes a while for it to get intresting, but that really doesn't ruin it for me!! this movie was scary!! I mean the dark scenery was creepy and the Grandpa is the creepiest element of this flim probably! this is one of my favorite flims of all time! Leatherface is scary and the movie is very entertaining, I also like the whole Hillbilly family, I thought they were hilarious and scary!!if you haven't seen it a highly recommend that you view this. it's SCARY!!
