Another blood-soaked exercize is stupidity, this movie is just as bad as other useless movies (Godfather, Saving Private Ryan) that push the limits of entertainment beyond decent. Violence, negative role models, and profanity is everywhere. But, a spark of creativity or optimism is nowhere to be found. Why would anyone want to watch this?
