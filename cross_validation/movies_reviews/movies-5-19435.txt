What can i say, i grew up on this movie. even though the movie makes no sense and everyones actions' motive is questionable, it keeps you watching again and again. maybe its the hope that you will one day figure it out. who is the tall man? where does he come from? is every town in the rest of the world a ghost town? where are all those midget-monk things at? in the desert or hell or what?there are too many questions about this movies to lists and thinking about it makes my head hurt. it is the movie that brought us the tall man and the hemicuda.argumentavly the strangest movie ever made, but a definate classic. highly recomended.
