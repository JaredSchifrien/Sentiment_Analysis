Jaws is the best horror movie because it still scares me today when I pass it on regular channels. Jaws is one of the best horror movies because I remember it freaking out everybody in Southern California so much so that no one wanted to go into the water at the beaches. Jaws was so good they made another two movies. I loved the special effects. Great!
