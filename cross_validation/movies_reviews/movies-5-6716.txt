Shows what a great director like Howard Hawks could do with a tiny budget, a B-movie cast, and some cheap special effects. Another one of those movies that should not be remade, because they'll never do it better than the original. The mostly-unseen monster (actually, James Arness in a carrot suit)anticipates the mostly-unseen Monster from the Id in Forbidden Planet, and even the shark in Jaws. Lots of snappy patter, overlapping dialogue, smart dames and tough guys. Sci-fi has rarely been done better, or been more fun.
