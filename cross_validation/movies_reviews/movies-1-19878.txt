Im glad I waited till this one came on HBO to see it...after the Ring I expected a good movie but it was horrible. I was so disappointed. It had a couple of good "surprise" moments but the overall story was far from unique and the ending left me going "Huh? I watched this movie for that?" I don't recommend this one at all!
