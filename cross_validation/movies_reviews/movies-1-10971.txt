Whatever happened to the hilarious comedianne whom brought us comedies such as The Distinguished Gentleman and The Nutty Professor? He now does terrible, mindless comedies such as I Spy, The Adventures Of Pluto Nash...and now Daddy Day Care . This film is putrid and disgusting. The only merit here is a fun performance by Anjelica Huston as the rival day-care owner. Otherwise, stay away. It's like watching a bad remake of Kindergarten Cop.
