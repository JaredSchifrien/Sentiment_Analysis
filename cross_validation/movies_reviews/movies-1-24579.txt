Oh George...what were you thinking? This film made no sense at all. Where was the story again? In this film set in outer space, Clooney finds that he has come in contact with his deceased wife, and has to cope with everything going on around him. What I didn't understand is why he didn't want her back, even though he loved her so much. Clooney was totally forced.
