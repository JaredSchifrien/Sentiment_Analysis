I missed part of the opening battle but I'm going back because I haven't seen anything that dark and thunderous since Excaliber. Favorite scene where the Carthenian gladiators flip the chariot,, maybe hollywoodish but awesome effects. Then end brought a tear to my eye. This guy wasnt just a raw fighting machine, he had thoughts desires and needs. He did it for his family, her family, and the man he onced looked up to. I could care less about the exact accuracy of the film. The gist of the politics summed up the twistedness then and now. Must see.
