People should stop whinging that this cartoon is to voilent for thier kids and it is not what you would expect from an animated film. Listen to yourselves! you are actually slagging the film off for being different ie. ORIGIONAL! ok the plot was not the most origional ever to hit the big screen, but then name an animated feature whose plot was not predictable. This is one of the best cartoon films i've seen and as for it being too depressing for kids - bad guys do bad stuff, boy stops them, boy falls in love, boy saves day, everyone happy. GET A GRIP!!!
