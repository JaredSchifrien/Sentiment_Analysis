possibly Kevin Smith's best movie. he finally had the budget and the means to do something big. The camoes are great and teh story is pretty good. George Carlin as a Bishop was pretty funny, and Jay and Silent Bo never fail to amuse. The star of this movie, i think, Is Alan Rickman. His dry performance and his sarcasm and lack of patience make this movie a whole lot funnier than if he wasn't there. Jasone Lee is great, too. This is an attack on religion, or at least the fickleness of orgainzed religion, so i wouldn't recommend it to people who hold strong views. However, as a catholic, i wasn;'t offended in the least. Though this movie is very funny, it is also very thought provoking.
