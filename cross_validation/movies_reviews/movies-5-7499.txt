The best comedy! I laughed until my sides split! Joe Pesci is such a wonderful actor. How could anyone who's brain is mostly intact not like this movie? Whoever thought up the character of Vinny was a true genius. I hope to see this again, maybe I'll rent it this weekend. People, if you are feeling down, this is the perfect movie to watch! You will laugh till you are exhausted! This is a fun, hilarious movie! (The way they make fun of all the rednecky accents is fun-ny!) Anyone who hasn't seen this terrific movie, SEE IT!
