I totally enjoyed this film. I thought that it was in fact a really good representation of the kind of ennui that some of us felt after highschool. I think it also speaks about kids today, the post modern sense of fashion, in trying to create a look of your own and to build ideas of your own from what has gone before that is really important in looking at why society is forming the way it is. I didn't think the film came across as too biased in favor of the characters, they were often made to look rediculous. This film reminded me of the sense of confusion that we often feel as we form our identities thoughout our lives. It also mocked the collector and I think you could read social commentary in that as well. We live in such an affluent society that we can collect things, most of us don't have to worry about day to day survival, we can amass luxury items and keep them on shelves forever expanding and we can even build our identities around them as well. I read a lot into this film and I think there was a lot of meat to grab on to, lots to think about and to talk about. That to me is the mark of a really good film.
