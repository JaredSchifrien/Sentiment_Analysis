This is what helped dvd players sell, I don't know which was better the story or the style (which every director and their mother copied off of) everything was well put together beautifully, the cinematography iwas so inovative it was a pure work of geinus. The story line may be hard to follow for some, but if you like to think a little bit instead of having everything right in front of you.. you'll love this story. Reloaded is just as good, but unfortunately thats where they should have stopped because revolutions seemed rushed and leaves the audience feeling empty. well at least me.
