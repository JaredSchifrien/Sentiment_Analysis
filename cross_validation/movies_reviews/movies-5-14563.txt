Great movie! There's a lot more to this movie than meets the eye! If you're looking for an adventure movie, you'll be disappointed. If you hate movies that have an 'open' ending, you will hate it. I think the ratings showm at this website reflect this. This is a movie about life itself and about the choices that we've made and will make. Many have criticized the ending. At the end of the movie, Tom Hanks has some new choices to make. The movie does not indicate exactly what he does. This is the way that the movie HAD to end because there is a certain amount of logic to each of the different choices that he could have made. This is what fascinates me about this movie. I love to ask people which choice do you think he made. Their responses are varied an always subject to debate. I'm not a touchy-feely kind of guy ( I got my degree in Accounting and things HAVE to balance, damn it!). But Cast Away really moved me.
