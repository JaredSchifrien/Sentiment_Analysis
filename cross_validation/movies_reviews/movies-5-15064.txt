JFK is one of the most compeling dramas I have ever seen.Oliver stone did an AMAZING job with this film as he does with every other movie he does. Probably the Biggest amount of tallented actors I have ever seen: to name a few Kevin Costern, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Sissy Spacek, Jack Lemmon, John Candy, and Gary Oldman. The movie has so much info and takes you Right in the middle of Jim Garrison's investigation; absolutly enthralling.
