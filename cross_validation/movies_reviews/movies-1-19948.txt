Terribly over-hyped movie. By the same group who made Super Troopers, this just didn't deliver the same kind of laughs (although, to be fair, I didn't find Super Troopers to be that great, either, though it had its moments). If you were unfortunate enough to see the movie House of The Dead, I think Club Dread was at least partially making fun of this movie. Given, it's supposed to be cheesy and bad, but it wasn't so bad it was funny, it was just bad. It had its moments (I think their version of Pac-Man was pretty interesting, at lest), but they were few and far between. Pretty much a waste of eight bucks.
