 Wall Street is a really entertaining movie. Michael Douglas' performance as the greedy corporate raider Gordon Gekko really made the film, in my opinion. His ruthless manipulation of people and money seemed completely realistic, and he also looked the part, with his extravagant wardrobe, trim physique, and deep tan. I loved the scenes where he spoke memorable lines such as, If you want a friend, get yourself a dog. and If this guy owned a funeral parlor, no one would die. Charlie Sheen also put in a solid performance playing an ambitious Wall Street stockbroker trying to make it big. There is never a dull moment in this movie, and it's worth seeing several times for the dialogue alone.
