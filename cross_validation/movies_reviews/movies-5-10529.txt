I don't think it can be noted for a great deal of cinematic brilliance, but it is nonetheless a favorite among people around my age (13-19). I must have seen it 35 times. Kids just love seeing the idea of a 10-year-old outsmarting two criminal bandits. The physical abuse they endure at the hands of Kevin McCallister is the extremely humorous part. Also, everyone has been angry at their family and felt left out at one point or another; but it teaches that you have to look past that and be with your family (especially during the holiday season).
