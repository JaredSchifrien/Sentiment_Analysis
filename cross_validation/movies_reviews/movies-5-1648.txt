A misunderstood film. This story is based on an old Chinese tale. . .yes, the flying is something you have to look past but our legendary tale of Paul Revere is just as fictional. CTHD is one of most beautifully shot films I have ever seen. Incredible cinematography, decent acting, terrific fight scenes. But it is simply a beautiful film to watch- the scenery, the costumes, the locations are just phenomenal.
