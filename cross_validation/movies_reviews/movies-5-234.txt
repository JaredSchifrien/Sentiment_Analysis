A wonderfully scripted and acted epic about the rise of a Scottish revolution. Mel Gibson gives the audience a very graphic depiction of Medieval life and warfare. While some aspects of the life of William Wallace are embelished, the lack of true factual data allows Gibson a bit of creative lisence.
