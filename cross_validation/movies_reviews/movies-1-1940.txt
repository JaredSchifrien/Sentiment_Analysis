Not near as disgusting as alot of people told me prior to watching it. They made it sound like a movie that had to be seen, it was just that gross. I thought it was one of the worst B-rated movies of that year...and I still wished I wouldn't have watched it. Pure cinema torture...not ONE actor did a good job...should have been shelved...HORRID !
