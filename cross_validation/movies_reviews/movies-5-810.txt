I think this movie was excellent...Although it was a thriller type suspense...it was very well done...This movie can keep u on the edge of your seat all the way to the end! I remember the 1st time I saw this.. It was for my birthday with some of my friends....THe whole theatere was packed so we had to sit on the floor seats really close to the picture! I can remeber freaking out at certain parts (being the only one in the audience screaming..haha)... : ) I read some of the comments above and I noticed some1 saying how they neva showed wen Bruce Willis showered or ate...and so on...but I mean not every movie shows that...but come on even though this movie didnt show wen a person wasnt eating or sleeping it was showing the MAIN purpose of the movie...YA get me? Neway...every1 should go and c this movie..its GREAT GREAT GREAT!!! The ending really gets u thinkin wat a great movie ...THis was such a good idea for a movie...and the actors were just fantastic..One of the best movies I have ever seen! :o)
