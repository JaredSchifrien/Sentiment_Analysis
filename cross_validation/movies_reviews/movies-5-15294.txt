I was amazingly surprised with this story. it's about a bachlor (Hugh Grant) who hates kids, and ins up getting stuck with one. He changes the life of this kid an though he doesn't know, the boy beggins to change his. a very emotional but satisfying movie I give it five *****. ( PG-13 for thematic elements some sexual refferences and Language, including two F-Bombs).
