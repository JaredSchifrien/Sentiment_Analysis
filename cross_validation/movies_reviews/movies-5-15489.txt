When I first heard about 13 Days I thought It sounded like a great movie. But the main reason I was going was to see the trailer for Lord of the Rings. But by the time 13 Days was over, I'd forgotten all about Lord of the Rings. Being from Canada, I wasn't very familiar with the story. All I knew was that the situation must've been resolved, since I knew nothing of a war between the States and Cuba. But having an idea about how the movie would end didn't spoil it at all. Every second of this movie was fascinating. It was intense without having action sequences. The high point in my opinion is the performance given by the actor portraying Bobby Kennedy. I can easily say that 13 Days is one of my favorite movies of the last few years, and I can't wait to see it again. It was quite a long movie, but it kept my interest throughout every scene. 13 Days is currently on top of my movie recommending list.
