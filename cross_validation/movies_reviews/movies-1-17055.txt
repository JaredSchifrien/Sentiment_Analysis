Ugh. What an amazing disappointment! There's nothing worse than going to see a movie you expected was going to be good, and it all ends up blowing in your face like a bomb. I cannot believe I saw this completely crappy and pointless movie. I'm sorry if I'm being crude here, but it was just so disappointing to see Leo make a fool out of himself. I paid 5 freaking bucks to 1.) have all my friends make a joke out of me for about a week (because I was the one who made them go see it). 2.) Have NO ONE at all trust me when I would say Hey, this movie looks good let's go see it! (no matter what movie I was reffering to). And 3.) Have to sit for about 2 hours that seemed to be the longest of all my life, to discover I had just made a fool out of myself by actually dragging my friends along (atleast if I wouldn't have, I would have been the only one suffering). The movie made me feel crappy and unwanted. Can't describe it anymore! It deserves a 0.1, but the lowest was a 1, so I'll just have to compromise!
