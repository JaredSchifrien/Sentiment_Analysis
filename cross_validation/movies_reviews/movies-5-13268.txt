Well written, sensitively directed and superbly acted. The portrayal of Captain John Miller as a humbly man, a school teacher who only wanted to return home to his wife but never made it, was very moving and highly compelling. My father was a medic on the front lines in WWII, he did make it back home, only he returned with more than just physical scars; something of which he never talked about, he was a humble man too, as well as a brave man. War flims, art imitating live, what a shame that it has to exist.
