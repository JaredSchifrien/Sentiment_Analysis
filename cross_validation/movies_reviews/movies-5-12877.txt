One of the greatest movies ever made. Most of the cast did an ecceptional acting job. However, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins stole the show. This is a perfect flowing movie in every aspect (plot buildup, musical score, stosphere, ec.). One cannot claim to have seen the best movies of all time unless they have seen The Shawshank Redemption.
