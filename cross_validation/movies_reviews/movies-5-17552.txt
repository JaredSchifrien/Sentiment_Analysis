This is one of the most visually stunning movies I have ever seen. Jeunet and Caro create a world so realistic and yet different that I couldn't help but wonder if they in fact live on the same planet as myself. The atmosphere is dark which allows the humor to juxtapose beautifully. Watch this film if you enjoy beauty.
