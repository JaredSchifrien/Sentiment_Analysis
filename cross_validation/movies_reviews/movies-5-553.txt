If I could I would give it 6 stars! This movie was just awesome. Granted, it is not for people who don't pay attention. The twists and turns will leave you in the dark if you don't or can't use your head for more than a hat rack. Spacey, Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Chaz Palmenteri, and even Del Torro were all grat in this movie. One creative script. I love it!
