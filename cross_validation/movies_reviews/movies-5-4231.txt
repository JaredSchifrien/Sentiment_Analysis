One of the best movies of the year, Ice Age is a brilliant cinematic accomplishment. The voice cast is well-rounded, the animation is stunning and the script is awesome. The banter is crackling with wit, there are tons of visual gags and even an uproarious Star Trek reference for the ones with the eyes for it. Not only funny, it is also warm, touching and has a very positive ending! Highly recommended for all!
