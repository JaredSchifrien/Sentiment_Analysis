Filled with naughty innuendos and toilet humor, 'The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad' is one of the funnier movies to come out in the latter half of the 20th Century. Leslie Nielsen's bumbling Frank Drebin harks back memories of the Keystone Cops of silent film. And with a madcap group of actors who provide for a hilarious ensemble behind Nielsen, the movie is a laugh riot. Who can forget the part where Drebin looks up Priscilla Presley's skirt while she is on the ladder and says boyishly: Nice beaver!? Or the sequence when the bad guy at the hot dog factory starts firing at Drebin, and uttering Ludwig has a message for you, Drebin responds Don't fire the gun, I can't hear what you're trying to say!? This movie was hysterical!
