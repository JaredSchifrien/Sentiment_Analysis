Altho I am supposedly at an age (61) - W/F where this type of movie should shock me, I was merely profoundly moved! 5 days after seeing it I am still disturbed by the images and story portrayed. I thought the casting was excellent and Geoffrey Rush deserves all the awards he might possibly be nominated for!! Altho I truly enjoy all the brain candy movies - this one had a impact on me that will last a very long time!!!
