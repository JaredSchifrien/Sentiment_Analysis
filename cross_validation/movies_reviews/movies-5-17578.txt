The favourite film of Russian critics(in a 1995 poll)is a deeply personal and complex autobiographical account of childhood,as well as an ambitious overview of 20th century Russian life and history..Although the pacing, time shifts and occasionally impenetrable meanings(typical of the director Tarkovsky) will not appeal to all tastes,the rapturous poetry of its images is unsurpassed.Rendering mundane objects and elements almost miraculous,it is a film of intense,inspiring beauty;a serious and utterly unique work of art.
