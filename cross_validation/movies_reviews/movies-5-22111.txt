absolutely amazing movie..the special effects were out of this world..keanu reeves acted brilliantly and was supported really well by lawrence.the story was spectacular and though it was slightly slow in the starting it was covered up by the end which was really good fun..it paved a new way for sci-fi movies and special effects
