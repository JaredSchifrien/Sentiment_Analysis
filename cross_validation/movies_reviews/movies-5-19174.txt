This has to be the greatest movie I have ever had the opportuninty of seeing. Not only is it the perfect horror movie it's funny! It's a great movie to watch w/ a group of friends and I would never miss a chance to see it. Thorne, Mr. Pink, and Tarman know what they're talking about and everything I have to say about it would just be a repeat of what they've already said.I highly recomend Return of the Living Dead to everyone who gets a chance to see it.
