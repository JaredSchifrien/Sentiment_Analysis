Greatest movie of all time. Humphrey Bogart's best movie. Mixed together a perfect combination of love, deceit, war, and a trace amount of humor. Appropriate for people of all ages but younger humans may not understand it to the full extent this deserves. Ingrid Bergman was very good in this. The loveable singer Sam added lots of drama to the movie becuase usually when a key scene occurred he played music.
