This movie made a mockery out of one of the darkest days in American history. According to the plot of this movie being stationed at Pearl was one big funfest. Nurses running around dressed in there casual clothes flirting with every Non Comm they see.Officers funning it up on the beach, loads of free time to be had by all.They make this prelude to war seem fun and romantic. If this is the way our military system operates I'LL reinlist tommorow. Now I know that Hollywood Takes libertys with the facts but this movie went way out of hand.If your going to make a movie about Pearl Habor then do so, show us the facts and the unknowns of the day. Not some stupid love story that holds no bearing at all in the dealings of the day. Dec. 7 1941 will live in infamy. this picture people will soon forget.
