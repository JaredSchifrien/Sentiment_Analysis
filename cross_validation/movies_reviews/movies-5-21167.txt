A snapshot of the Summer of Love, the idealism and excess of the hippies, the rigidness of the rich, the terror of war. One of the most enduring things about this film is the way it portrays how the freedom from social ethics of the hippies brings joy and passion, but also has a shadow side. Also, the lyrics push limits even by todays standards and the vocal parts and harmonys are still some of the best today.
