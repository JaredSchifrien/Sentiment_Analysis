what a film, they simply do not make films like this anymore. what we need is more films with all star casts like this one, I know that you are going to say what about sneakers which did have a lot of stars in it but when you watch that film once more you and you see how many stars are in it it sticks in your mind! anyway what we need is a film when everybody you see on screen is or was a star! go for it hollywood
