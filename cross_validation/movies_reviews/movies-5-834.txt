Let me first say that THIS IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE! Even though it is categorized as horror, it is more like drama with a supernatural theme. And, like many have said before me, it is a great movie. Great acting, brilliant script, and of course the ending... wow. And, yes, it will withstand the test of time - just like Psycho did and many other great movies.
