this is one of my very favorite movies and im a big val kilmer fan. he played the role of doc holliday wonderfully. he actually got ready for the role by losing enough weight to resemble hollidays appearance that kilmer himself became ill during filming. in one scene where doc collapses in the saloon kilmer in fact had collapsed for real and almost was replaced
