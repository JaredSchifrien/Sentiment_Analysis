A classic. One of my favorite scenes is when the door of Sean Penn s van opens up and they fall out in a cloud of smoke, although every Spicoli scene is great. Did you know this movie was based on a book written by Cameron Crowe, the guy who wrote the screenplay for the autobiographical movie Almost Famous ? Crowe supposedly spent a lot of time doing undercover research in a southern California high school to gather material for the book/movie.
