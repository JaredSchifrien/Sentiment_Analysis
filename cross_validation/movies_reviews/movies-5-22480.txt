The Greatest Sci-Fi movie ever made. A classic Shakespearian story to a futurisic theme. It is the 23rd century. Khan Noonian Sihn, a geneticly engineered dictator from 1996 seeks revenge against a starfleet Captain and a Universe that betrayed him 15 years ago. With a weapon of unbelievable power, the Genesis device, the crew of a starship, and a hiding science team at stake, including Kirk's alienated son, Kirk must overcome all odds, and defeat an arch nemesis he thought he had left behind. Riccardo Montalban was great, no one else could have played the part. Leonard Nimoy was also great, when Spock died, it touched every Star Trek fan. Everyone must see this great movie.
