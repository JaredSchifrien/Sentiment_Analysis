I wanted to be Molly Ringwald (Samantha in the movie) in this movie. Oh, and Jake, he was so cute. The sophmore girl wins over the popular seniors heart as he dumps his oh so popular, hot girlfriend for Samantha. I have seen this movie (not exaggerating) approximately 200 times and I still love it. There are so many funny parts. Everyone plays their part perfectly. Anthoney Michael Hall, Molly Ringwald, Matt Dillon are some big names but then there is the classic Long Duck Dong and the brother who says one of the best lines in the movie....'Sofa city sweetheart'. Just thinking about it makes me hope that it is on USA or some other tv station this weekend.
