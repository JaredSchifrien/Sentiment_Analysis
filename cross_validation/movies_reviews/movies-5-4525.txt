Great! I love that movie it is my favorite movie of all time. The one made in 1998 isn't as good but I absolutely am addicted to this one. Hayley Mills was really good. And the movie was charming and funny. And is just better then the 1998 one because Hayley Mills- The one who plays the twins is way better then the one in the 1998 film that plays the twins. So thats why I rated this movie a 5 cause it is the best Movie of all time
