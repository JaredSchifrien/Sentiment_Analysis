Okay, I'm sorry to say this, but I hated this movie. ALL of the characters have exactly one facial expression - disturbed. Aside from that, this would have been a much better story if they had left the whole alien thing a mystery, but to actually bring them out and cut off their fingers... Well, they lost me there.
