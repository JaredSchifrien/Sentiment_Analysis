First off, watch the French version with English subtitles (if you need them). It's much better, and tends to make the story easier to follow. Second off, it's beautiful. Just... wow. Costumes, scenery, choreography, everything. The score is stunning. Now. Yes, it is glaringly historically inaccurate. But I don't think it was one of their priorities, let alone something they had in mind. In any case, after all is said and done, it's still a great movie, and worth watching just to see Fronsac frenzy at the Brotherhood's hideout. Also for the final fight scene with Jean-Francois, to see his sword. A bone sword/grappling hook/chain thing. It's worth watching to the end to see it in action.
