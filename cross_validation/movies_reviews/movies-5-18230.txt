Can you honestly sit through this movie in its entirety and not at least laugh you ass off? It is not possible! Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell are probably the greatest actor director team of all time. Bruce Campbell is one of the most underrated comedic actors out there. This man is at least twelve times funnier than Jim Carrey. Anyway. Evil Dead 2 is almost a remake of the original. It recaps the beggining of the original minus three characters. Lynda becomes a deadite and from there the sequel begins. This film in no way tries to scare the viewer, maybe startle a few of them. The startles are surpassed by the brilliant comedic moments. A beautiful array of the macabre and the comedic, Evil Dead 2 is a classic along with the rest of this incredible series. HIGHLY,HIGHLY,RECOMMENDED!! along with the rest of the trilogy. Swallow this.
