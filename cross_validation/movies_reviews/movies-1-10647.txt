My significant other insisted this was a movie for me -- the reviews he had read were spectacular. He was wrong and so were those reviewers. I cannot recall much about this long drawn out tale other than I should have gotten the largest popcorn they sold -- the meal would have made the experience a bit shy of a big waste of time.
