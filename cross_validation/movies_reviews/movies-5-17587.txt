The most charming and well-animated movie I have ever seen. Watch it once for the delightful story of devoted grandmotherly love, twice for the plethora of minor characters, a third time for the amazing animation (especially the way light and shadow are used), and a fourth time because you can't get enough of it. Maybe even a fifth, just to delight again in the triplets' culinary and orchestral eccentricities.
