Wow! Directed by Martin Sorsese who has a long working relationship with Robert De Niro and mainly shot in black and white. Its basically the life story of Jake LaMotta's life in regards to boxing and his relationships. The fight scenes in this are magnificent and I don't know how people can rate Rocky as better than this. This film doesn't sensationalise Jake's life, it shows him hitting his young wife, lashing out at his brother, being jealous of other men looking at his wife and him putting on weight. The storyline is as intense as the fighting scenes. I'm not a fan of boxing, but I'll happily sit down and watch this movie.
