I know I'm going to get killed for this but Is it possible to hate this movie. Because I do. All the jokes were way too over-the-top to be funny. The funniest stuff you couldn't understand because of their British accents and the ending didn't make much sense. If you want funny comedies watch Airplane, Naked Gun movies, Pink Panther movies and Who Frammed Roger Rabbit. I'm not kidding I didn't enjoy this film. But the credits before the film was funny.
