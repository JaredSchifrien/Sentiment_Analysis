Many claim Beauty and the Beast or Snow White to be their favorite tradationally-animated Disney feature. I, on the other hand, choose The Emperor's New Groove. Certaintly able to be described as an atypical Disney film, this one ditches the emotional plot and sappy music to focus on out-and-out humor. The voice cast is quite talented, but Patrick Warburton shines through as the enjoyably-inept Krunk. With smooth animation, the feature has snappy dialogue. The best humor comes from moments where the fourth wall is shattered with style. More movies and TV shows should break the fourth wall and play with the sense of reality!
