I could NEVER watch this movie. I saw the trailer for it, and I couldn't watch it. I don't get scared easily, but it's when I'm in bed with the lights out, that everything I watched during the day comes back to haunt me. I was terrified for three days after just watching the trailer. I don't like demonic movies, because unlike normal horror, this is actually real. This could happen.
