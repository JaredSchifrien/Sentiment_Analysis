Babe is a funny, touching and enduring film about a pig that becomes a sheep herder. It may be classifyed as a children's movie, but adults will get great enjoyment out of the movie as well. The animals in the movie are utterly charming. James Cromwell is superb as the taciturn owner of the special pig.
