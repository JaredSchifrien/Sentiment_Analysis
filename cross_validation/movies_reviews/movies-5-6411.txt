Movies usually blow it when dealing with issues of racism...films often make the common mistake (like we all do) of simply painting one character as 'good' and the other as 'evil'. I believe this film is the greatest exploration of racism I've ever seen in a movie. Nobody's simply 'good' or 'evil'- all characters are developed and the performances are spectacular. Rod Stieger as the small-town sheriff is unforgetable. Sidney Poitier as the Philadelphia cop is no less fascinating. Watch the film as these two stubborn characters learn just enough about each other to learn mutual respect. Just a powerful example of great filmmaking.
