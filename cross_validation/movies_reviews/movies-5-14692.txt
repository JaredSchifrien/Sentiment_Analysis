Okay, I admit I'm biased as a single mom of three kids who would like to think that someone like me could do something so amazing. But really, she was just working hard and stumbled upon something that, even if I were her, few could turn their back on. I liked this movie for some of the more subtle scenes that depict the heartache of a mother who must work to keep food on the table. The best scene was when she was in her car coming back from Hinkley late at night and heard about her baby's first word. Julia Roberts acted in that scene as any other mom whose heart was broken over missing such an important moment would. I cried with her. I tell any single person that doesn't seem to get what it is like for me to watch this movie. Those that took my advice come back and say that they had no idea what true juggling was. I don't agree with her outspoken way of behaving sometimes, but in all she is to be admired.
