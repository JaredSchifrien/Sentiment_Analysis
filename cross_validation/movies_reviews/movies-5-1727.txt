As Dr. No is the first James Bond film (released in 1962) and was largely responsible for the ultimate success of the series, the movie would merit five starts on that basis alone. Of course the film deserves a high rating on its on as well. First, the film establishes much of 007's persona which lasted throughout the series. Bond is tough, smart, suave and witty. Second, the film is set in a relatively exotic locale (ie Jamaica) and uses local music throughout the film. For some viewers, this was their first exposure to this type of island music (eg ska and calypso). Third, the plot is strong but not overly reliant on action (which has plagued some of the more recent films in the series). Fourth, the film includes some hi-tech aspects (remember it was 1962) with nuclear power, rockets, and a mechanical dragon as part of the story which became a staple of the series. Fifth, as icing on the cake, the film boasts one of the best Bond Girls in the form of Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder (setting yet another trend of intriguing names for the series) and features the best Felix Leiter played by Jack Lord. (It's a shame that Lord did not reprise this role in latter films.) Finally, the roles of both M (Bernard Lee) and Miss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell) are introduced and established in this first 007 movie. On an artistic note, Dr. No differs from some of the other Bond films in that the viewer does not ever see Bond's primary nemesis until near the end of the movie. This plays on the already mysterious nature of a man named Dr. No and builds suspense throughout the film. The viewer gets the impression that No is just hiding in his lair merely waiting to ensnare Bond when the time comes. This tactic appears again in You Only Live Twice (1967) and Diamonds Are Forever (1971) but with less effect.
