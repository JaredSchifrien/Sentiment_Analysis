When I first tried to rent this, the guy at the video store snatched it away from me and said I'm sorry, I just can't let you leave with this movie, it's that bad. Now I know why. This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's not that far behind, either. It's like a really crappy rehash of Ringu (Japanese film, 1998; the American remake, The Ring , came out in 2002, the same year as Feardotcom ), with the same basic idea of If you watch this, you will die in X amount of days . I did like the reasoning behind it (a tortured soul wanting revenge), but it just didn't make for a strong story. The true antagonist's motives were never really explained (he just kind of liked torturing women for fun, I guess). The excessive nudity and violence, some of which is highly disturbing, seemed as if it were there only for shock value and nothing more. If your local video rental guy really cares, he won't let you leave with this video.
