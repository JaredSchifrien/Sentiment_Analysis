Another 1980s classic. I must have seen it 1000 times, but I just never get tired of it. It had all of the major high school categories; Brian the geek, Andrew the jock, Alison the freak, Claire the princess, and John the slacker. It showed how appearances could deceive, and that not everyone has it that bad. And of course, Molly Ringwald is perfect in her roll.
