This has to be my all time favorite horror movie. I wouldn't really call it horror as much as I would call it comedy. This movie is hilariouse. I cannot describe to you the depths of dark humor reached in this dare I say ingeniouse film. It is an un credited classic and if you ever have the chance to rent or buy this film DO IT! I gaurantee you will laugh your ass off. What keeps this film going is the great dialouge and the surprisingly good ensemble acting. This film has some of the funniest scenes and brilliant quotes to come out of a movie since Army of Darkness, HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMENDED! MORE BRAINS!!!
