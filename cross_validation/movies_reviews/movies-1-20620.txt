Please, hand me the air-sickness bag. A stupid turd of nostalgia featuring two of the absolutely worst leads ever to disgrace the screen. Olivia Newton-John sure looks good in this one, but as usual, sings like she's got a clothespin on her nose. John Ravolta puts in another oily and unconvincing gooch performance, singing like a frog in rut, and twitching around in that disconcerting manner of his. The songs are juvenile claptrap. The dancing is predictable and hardly memorable. The script is moronic. Otherwise, this is a great flick!!!
