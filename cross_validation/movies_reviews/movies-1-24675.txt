Good movie idea gone bad. They had special effects that were great and the idea of an invisible man is something you could really run with creatively, but Kevin Bacon was just creepy and Elizabeth Shue was annoying. The English chick who's name I dont know, whom Bacon surprised in her apartment is a hottie though.
