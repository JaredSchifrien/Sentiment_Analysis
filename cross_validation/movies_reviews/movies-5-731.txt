The last action sequence in this movie is the best I've ever seen. It starts with Duncan tied to a stake and set on fire in a trade which allows the others to go free, then Daniel Day Lewis shoots Duncan from afar so that he won't suffer, then one of the English sisters jumps off a mountain and commits suicide rather than be a captive of the Moguia Indians, then the Mohegan son fights nobly but is killed and pushed off the mountain, then the father kills the Moguia Indian; all with some great background violin music. I get teary-eyed every time I watch it.
