This is a beautiful story with superb animation, and you can tell that Walt Disney put a lot of time and love into the making of this one. The only thing is, it just KILLS me when Bambi loses his mother. I can understand that it's a very important part of the film because it's about how life really is in the forest, but it just gets to me. One of the absolute best from Disney.
