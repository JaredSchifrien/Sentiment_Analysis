it was the brits who did it all, the americans were not involved. dont cry people, no americans died here, so of course no one died worth crying about. i wonder, if the film had been made with english accents and the subs were called 'HMS whatever' instead of 'SS whatever' would this film have ever been even seen in the US. somehow i dont think so. this makes me sick. claiming the heroic deeds of the british as your own and not mentioning them at all.
