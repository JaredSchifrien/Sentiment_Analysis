Really enjoyable and quite different from the usual Hollywood fare, and with a gorgeous score by Tan Dun (Yo-Yo Ma on the cello). While you can enjoy it for the cinematography alone, the story is engaging and poignant. I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. UPDATE: I think it is interesting that people complain about the stunts being unrealistic--when they are fans of Hollywood films that feature heroes emerging unscathed, with nary a hair out of place from gigantic explosions, twenty-car crashes, machine-gunnings, plasma-rifle-riddlings, nuclear explosions, asteroid strikes, gamma-ray irradiations, and other culturally acceptable stunts.
