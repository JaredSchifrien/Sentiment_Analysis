A great cinematic achievement. Cinematography, script, acting, and direction are flawless. I would easily put it in the top fifty films of all time, possibly fairly high in that rank. Newman is superb, Law is exquisite, and Hanks is in the role of his life. The fact that outside the bank-robbing and being totally mobbed up, Hanks' character is in many ways the replication of my father, may be colouring my judgement. And if it is, be damned to it. Its a fine movie.
