How this film made so much money is a mystery to me. Okay, the villain of the piece is....a big storm...that everyone knows about...but our protagonists don't care...because thar be fish in dem dar waves. George Clooney and Mark Walberg are both talented actors but not even their skills can overcome corny dialogue and a story that may make for good reading but makes for excrutiating viewing.
