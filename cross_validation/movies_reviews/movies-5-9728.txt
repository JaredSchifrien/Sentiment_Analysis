A slightly above average war movie. M*A*S*H is based on the true life experience of the author. HE was a real doctor in a M*A*S*H unit in Korea. The book reads like a newpaper account of the antics of the unit. Fortunatly, the screenplay is much, much better than the novel. Elliot Gould, Donald Sutherland and Tom Skerrit all are terrific as the draftee doctors. Only Gary Burgoff as Radr made the transition from movie to TV series. The movie was based in Korea, but Robert ALtman wanted to make a point about the war in Vietnam, and have the audience thnk about Vietnam, so Korea is mentioned only sparingly throughout the movie. It doesn't matter which war the movie is set in, it is a biting indicment against war, and tha maddness which causes it.
