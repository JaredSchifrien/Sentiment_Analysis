Classic movie, not as scary as I thought it would be, but it does have class and that is what stands it apart from all the other modern horror movies except Halloween and Night of the Living Dead. This movie shows a family of insane killers going about their everyday tasks. And that is what gets to people. Phrases like I told you to stay away from that graveyard , and I never could take no pleasure in killing from the cook. Or Let's let Grandpa have a whack, you always said he was the best. And me and leatherface do all the work, he's just a cook , from the hitchhiker. These phrases and many like them put into the context they are in, in the movie make this film disturbing to some, and classic to others. This film will never be duplicated or topped, because once you achieve perfection in a certain area there is no way to improve. Be it film or whatever in this case The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a masterpiece, some people don't get it, but for those that do they enjoy.
