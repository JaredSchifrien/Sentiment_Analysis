How can someone not appreciate the comedy of Mike Myers, in a movie that in my opinion will stay forever in the hall-of-fame of comedy? Austin Powers is not supposed to be about hilarious one-liners, or sarcastic jokes. Austin Powers is all about character's expressions, and faces, and situations in which these characteristics are emphasized on the individual in order to exaggerate it and make it uncontrollably funny. That is what makes Austin Powers so unique, and a hit comedy different from anything else anyone has ever seen.
