i have seen this film a million times, amazing how I still get a laugh out of it every time. Broadrick was excellent in this film, and the way the over all plot came together was simply perfect. My favorite scene is when Cameron calls the principal pretending to be Slone's father. The principal tells him off, thinking it is Ferris Buler. Ferris Buler calls on the other line, and watch the fur fly!
