This movie was so great. Any female who faces the dating dilemmas Bridget Jones does can relate to this movie. Renee Zellweger was abolsutely hilarious in this role-and so convincing that an English acquaintance of mine thought that Renee Zellweger was British, intstead of Texan. She really should have gotten the Oscar for this role. She was so good in it.
