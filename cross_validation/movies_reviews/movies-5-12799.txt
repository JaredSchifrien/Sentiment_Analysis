Excessive? Yes. Alarming? Most certainly. Funny? Relentlessly. In this film, Morgan Spurlock merely drove home, in irrevocable, undeniable and not uncertain terms something those of us with two brain cells already know: that 95% of junk food is total crap (they don't call it junk food for nothing) and can be downright harmful to you if you overindulge. However, obviously millions of Americans have less than two brain cells when you consider how many of them are stuffing their faces at this very moment in the countless, various culinary crapatoriums found in every strip mall and on every highway in our grossly obese and flab-disgusting country. It used to be that the average waist size for adult men in the U.S. was 36 inches: today, it's like 42. The average dress size for women used to be eight: today, it's 14. Lazy, ignorant, gluttonous and self-destructive slobs that they are, Americans need a movie like this much more than they need a 700 calorie soft drink, a 600 calorie super order of fries or a 550 calorie Big Mac. What was disconcerting about this film was: (1) Spurlock gained something like 27 pounds in a month of eating McBowel; (2) he was at the verge of compromising his liver from such a high-fat diet (even one of his own physicians was amazed), and (3) eating all that feces on a bun even made him, in the words of his girlfriend, less of a man than he used to be. What was sad in this film was that scene featuring the pretty, but very overweight teenage girl, who, citing the supposedly healthy and fat-reducing qualities of Subway (vomit) sandwiches, bemoans the fact that she can't afford to eat there twice a day. The funniest bit? When Spurlock ate the triple quarter pounder and almost immediately gave it back, hurling out the window of his vehicle. They even panned the camera out the window of the car so that the audience could see the upchuck spewed on the ground. Now, there's a documentarian dedicated to getting all the facts on film!
