I went to see this movie with high enthusiasm and was quite let down. It was not worth spending $8 on. The same jokes as the original movie were used, most times less effectively than the first Austin Powers. The new characters, mainly Fat Bastard, served for a few laughs, but overall, it's NOT a must see.
