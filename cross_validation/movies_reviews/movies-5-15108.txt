The camera work in combination with a thrilling and totally on key soundtrack only enhance a seemingly flawless plot. Best $8 I have spent in a while. This movie is capable of evoking emotions commonly no associated with movies of its pace, action, and big name star caliber. However, Michael Douglas, Salma Hayek, and Catherine Zeta Jones team up to really make a memorable movie.
