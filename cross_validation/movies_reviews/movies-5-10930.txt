I now realize it is a bit juvnenile, but it is the movie I have probably seen the most times in my life. I can never watch it through without cracking up at least 5 times. The idea of the 10-year-old Kevin McCallister outsmarting everyone he encounters is hilarious. One of my favorite moments is when he manipulates the movie in his hotel room to sound like it's talking to the workers at the Plaza Hotel. The schemes he devises to trick Harry and Marv are also extremely amusing. Overall, an indescribably comical movie.
