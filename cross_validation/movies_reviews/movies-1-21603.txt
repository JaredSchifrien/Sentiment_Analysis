Apparently, I'm one of the few who thinks differently than the rest about this movie. I hated it. I'm beginning to come to the realization that I hate fantasy, sci-fi type movies that last for hours. I did not appreciate Star Wars, Harry Potter, or this. I read the Harry Patter books, and liked them fine. I'm considering reading these, althought the movie is a huge deterrent. I vow, from this day foward, never to sit through another movie like this.
