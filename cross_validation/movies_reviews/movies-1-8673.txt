One of the saddest wastes of cinema that is out there. Its hard to imagine that creative, well-acted, upbeat movies like Star Trek: Nemesis, Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, Pokemon 4Ever, Daddy Day Care, and Down with Love get bad reviews from critics and bad mouthed by most other teens. First of all, the plot is patently offensive. A group of high school teens vowing to lose their virginity by prom night? It would be good if they were rejected and realized that they had to treat women with respect, but that doesn't happen. Instead, sex is treated just like it is any other need--such as air. Shockingly, the women in this movie are just as perverted as the males! And, you think that makes this movie filled the gills with bad role models--stand by for more! For example, an extremely mean-hearted prank is played on someone causing them to have...stomach problems. Are the people who do this punished? No. Of course, profanity rules the day in this movie that had to be cut multiple times from being NC-17. In the end, the males aren't taught a lesson or thrown in jail and the females don't go seeking gentlemen. Thus, this movie is a complete waste of time--full of NO humor, NO positive role models, NO one on the side of good, NOTHING.
