This is an awsome movie and one of my favorites. The cast was very beleivable. I think the blandness of Ryders character in the movie was meant to be that way in order to compliment Jolies wildness. Of course it was a little different than the book. Movies aren't as clear because they're not so black and white as books. That's the coolest part about the movie. We can see it differently. I don't believe these girls were as crazy as they wanted us to believe they were.I think more that they were just women who didn't want to follow the rules of the outside world. Maybe even the outside world would like to be as carefree as these women are sometimes but, we're afraid people will think we're crazy. I give the movie a 5 star rating because it's as realistic and crazy as this world we're living in.
