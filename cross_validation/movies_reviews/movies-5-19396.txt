An excellent, moody King adaptation, brilliantly directed (by David Cronnenberg, whose films I usually do not enjoy), and acted by all. Chris Walken, Martin Sheen, Herbert Lom, Anthony Zerbe, Brooke Adams, Tom Skerritt--all excellent. A little episodic but chilling (Martin Sheen as a psychopathic President; not quite West Wing material). One of the best King films.
