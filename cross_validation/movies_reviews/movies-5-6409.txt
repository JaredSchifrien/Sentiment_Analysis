This silent classic,rated among the all-time top 10 by Village Voice ,Spanish and French critics, was inexcusably omitted from the A.F.I'S Top 100.By turns lyrical,dramatic,exuberant,romantic and enchanting,its gloriously photographed tale,of a man in a Germanic-style village tempted against his kind wife by a glamorous vamp from the city,mixes the director's European artistic sensibility with American narrative flair- for 90 minutes of cinephile heaven.
