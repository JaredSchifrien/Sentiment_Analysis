My favorite film in my favorite series of films of all time. So much to see in this movie, and it's all great. It does leave you hanging in a way, but they had to stop somewhere I guess. In any case, this is film-making at it's absolute best. There are so many memorable scenes...The battle on Hoth with the Imperial Walkers, Luke being captured by the Wampa creature and the audience sees him really use the force for the first time to pull the lightsaber into his hand, Luke learning to be a Jedi on Dagobah, we get to meet that lovable Yoda for the first time, the Millenium Falcon flying into the asteroid belt, only to learn that they are in the belly of a huge space slug, Han and Leia escaping to Cloud City, only to learn that they've been betrayed by Lando Calrissian to Vader, Luke flying to Cloud City to face Vader in what is probably the best lightsaber duel of all the movies, Luke getting his hand severed at the wrist and then finding out moments later that Vader is his father. So many wonderful scenes and situations. I wish everyone could feel the way I do about this movie.
