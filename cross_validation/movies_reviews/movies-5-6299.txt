I must've seen this movie over 100 tiumes. It was my favorite movie as a child, and remains my favorite to this day. Audrey is amazing in this movie. Who would've thought that someone as classy and flawless as Audrey would make such a great Eliza Doolittle? As much as I love Julie Andrews, I think Audrey was perfect for the screen version of this classic.
