Could be the best of the traditional westerns. Wayne was in one of his best, perhaps only outdone by his work in Fort Apache . As with all westerns of its era it is not politically correct in its treatment of Indians, however, it does convey a sense of the harshness for all involved in the confrontation between settler and Indian in the south-west. A good flick.
