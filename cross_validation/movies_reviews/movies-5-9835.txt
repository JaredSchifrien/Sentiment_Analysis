This movie is one of the greatest Friendship comedies ever. Romy White (Mira Sorvino) and Michelle Weinburger (Lisa Kudrow) were outcasts in high school. Now 10 years later, They're fun-loving ladies who go to dance clubs. Only problem is their 10 year high school reunion. Romy is afraid their lives and great new looks aren't impressive enough. Watch for actresses Janeane Garofalo as the morbid Heather Mooney, Elaine Hendrix as Lisa, and Camryn Manheim as the hyper-spazz Toby. This film is about true friendship and being true to yourself. Not only that, It's hilarious!
