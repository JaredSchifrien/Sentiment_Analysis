I've discovered one thing about this movie for certain: people either really hate it or really love it. I'm one of those people that really love it. It's a hilarious movie, it has a pretty much good plot (even if it is a little off-the-wall; ok, make that a LOT off-the-wall) and all the people who do the voices are wonderful at them. I can think of nothing to complain about...ummm...Kuzco needs a love interest. But that's it and that's stretching. I recommend it to both adults and kids; that's right ADULTS and kids. In fact the adults would probably find it funnier.
