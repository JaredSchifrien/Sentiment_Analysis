This movie is magical for many of us who like it . Robert Zemickis unintentionally creates a movie that is so poignant and thought provoking that it changes the life of those who love it , not to mention giving foreigners like me a different perspective of recent American history . Personally , I always feel positive and serene when I listen or recall the beautiful score , lines and scenes of Forrest Gump . An American classic !
