Why is it that you could eat in the finest of restaurants and still have bad food? The money spend for this movie could have revigorated the economy of a small 3-rd world country.And what is the result?Love story between social classes?Yeah, very entertaining.A young Picasso on his way to America?Yeah, very realistic.A bad upper class vilain spiting on the heads of the poor?Pleaaassseee.....Ok the sinking of the ship was excellent,but who cares?Like I said, you can have crapy meals in the finest of restaurants.
