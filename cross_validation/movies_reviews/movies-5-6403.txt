Great westen story! Not the best western I've ever seen, but very high up there. John Ford is a genius. He certainly has a feel for the landscape in his pictures and it shows in The Searchers. For those who think John Wayne is a bad actor, I urge you to see him in this film. His potrayal of Ethan Edwards is one of the best performances in cinema history. The only thing I don't understand is how, at first Debbie is reluctant to go with them but when the other guy (I forget his name) sneaks into the camp and tells her he's gonna take her away, she's more than happy. A last minute slip-up which kind of hurts the dramatic impact of the climax. But other than that, The Searchers is a pretty solid film.
