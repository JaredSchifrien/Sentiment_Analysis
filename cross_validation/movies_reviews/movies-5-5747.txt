Hitchcock at his best. Considering it was produced in the 60's, the SFX are fantastic. The plot is his usual suspense and making you wait to see what happens. It really does ask a question - what would we do if different species turned on us??? Oh yes, since when was Wesley Snipes in Hitchcock films done in the 60's?????
