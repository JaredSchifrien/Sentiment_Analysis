I had high expectations for this movie and they were met. I don't usually laugh out loud at movies but this movie made me laugh. I love Ben Stiller, he is a funny bastard! This movie was histerical from begining to end. All the crap that this poor innocent guy has to go through to win over his fiance's father. You really do feel bad for him but, you can't help but want more bad stuff to happen because the comedy sequences are just too funny.
