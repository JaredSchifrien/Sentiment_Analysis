This is an awesome, incredible movie!! One of the best out, and one of my favorites!! The story is almost too powerful for its own good, as the slightly emotional among us probably had trouble staying dry-eyed through parts. But, it never got overly sappy at all - never pathetic. Just a great, warm, incredible movie. Patch Adams, the man, has become one of my true to life heros.
