This movie is an absolute triumph. The character collaboration and conflict is ingenius, every emotion played on, every heart opened, every thought explored. This is an incredibly responsible bit of filmmaking, wonderfully edited, divinely written. It prods into the human spirit as few others have done before it, trailing the life of boy/man genius Will Hunting. We see him in love, we see him in pain, we see him cornered, we see him forced to face his past, his present, and his future as an insanely gifted man. We see him interact with a variety of characters, including psychiatrists, bar buddies, childhood friends, fellow geniuses (with an explainable amount of contempt), and girls. He is both accelerated and hindered by his unheard of brain power, both good and bad sides of his talents are explored. Robin Williams, Minnie Driver, and Ben Affleck give performances comparable to Damon's own. Surprisingly, Casey Affleck, portraying the stupidest bloke in Boston as a foil to Will Hunting, delivers a performance to evoke both humor and pity. All involved in this movie deserve commendation. Watch it and watch it again.
