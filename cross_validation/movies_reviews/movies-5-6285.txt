Not only is this the best war movie ever made, it could be the best movie ever made. The story survives today just as it dod when it was first made. Never mind that the charecters are German (the enemy), this movie is moving nonetheless. It speaks to and about not only the Germans, but any soldeir in any conflict in any time. The tale is timeless. It really puts the horrors of war in the proper prespective. Very well acted. Lew Ayers does an excellent job. I can highly recomend this movie for everyone.
