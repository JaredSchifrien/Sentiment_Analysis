This stinker was so far below Dustin Hoffman it is hard to imagine WHAT he was thinking when he agreed to take the part. Beatty, on the other hand, is another story entirely. This film is only slightly above Plan 9 from Outer Space - and, in Ed Wood's defense, at least he had the excuse of a low budget.
