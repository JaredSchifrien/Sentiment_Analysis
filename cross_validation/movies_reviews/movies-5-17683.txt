Leave behind any misconceptions about Indian cinema;this wonderful Satyajit Ray film (the first of the famous Apu trilogy)about a young boy and his poor family in Bengal is far removed from the gaudy extravagant melodramatic Bollywood musicals,and is undoubtedly one of the crowning achievements of World cinema.Winner of the 1955 Cannes festival,it's gently engaging,beautifully observant of nature,imbued with a child's sense of wonderment,as well as deeply lyrical,wise and poetic.Recommended unreservedly,to anyone who prefers contemplative pleasures to breakneck action.
