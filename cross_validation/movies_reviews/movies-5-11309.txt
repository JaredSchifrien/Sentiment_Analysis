Hey everyone! Well, despite what oodie had to say I think that Scooby Doo was great! And the kids in the audience were laughing quite histerically at the movie.. along with the adults. NO kid would rather the museum over Scooby Doo... I haven't watched the show in a long time and to go to the movies and see it was like seeing the cartoon characters in real life. The actors that partrayed these roles were great! I mean, like Matthew Lillard... I never was too big of a fan of his, but in this role he was hilarious!! I remember one part where he said something I found myself laughing for like 20 minutes ahahaha.. I would go se the movie again just for that part.. haha okay well anyways.. Freddie Prince Jr .. Whoa baby!! Even with blonde hair he is a sexy papa! And he was hilarious in this role too.. As were all of the actors.. Sarah Michelle Gellar was great! I found myself laughing at her lot.. She was adorable in her the little purple dress he wore, but nehoo!! The woman who playes Thelma was great! The movie was great! Whoa! I think I'm taking up too much space so I'm gonna go! If anyone is in the mood for a funny lil movie then I suggest go see this! :)
