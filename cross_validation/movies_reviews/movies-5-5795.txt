Call me a sucker for films that take place within an enclosed environment, because this film, along with many others of its kind, is one of my absolute favorite movies. Fueled with emotion and running primarily on the performances of the actors, Twelve Angry Men is an excellent example of the many different fascettes of the human condition. A coincidence is possible, no matter how fantastic, and this film proves it.
