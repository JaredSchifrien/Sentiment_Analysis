I love this movie! Jim Carey and Jeff Daniels both do a great job playing a couple of bumbling fools with sub-human intelligence. The writers did a great job of putting jokes in the script as much as possible, yet tying everything together. I'm tired of people who insinuate that one's preference in entertainment has anything to do with intelligence. Of course this movie is ridiculous and stupid, but it's also hilarious. Dumb and Dumber is not meant to be a cinematic masterpiece; it's supposed to be funny and entertaining, which it definitely accomplished. I'm not going to say that if you hated this movie, you have no soul or sense of humor or anything like that. Different people laugh at different kinds of comedy. I'm just saying that from my end, I can't imagine why someone wouldn't find this flick funny.
