Traffic was amazing!!!!! The peoplw who you thought couldn't act, SURPRISE, they can. Michael Douglas is my hero. I loved this movie it was pure genious. And anyone who trys to compare this movie to The General's Daughter , will have to deal with me. If you havent seen it go see it. I am in love with Traffic.
