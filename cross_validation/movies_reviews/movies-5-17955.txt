ok I have just seen this movie recently for the first time w/ my fren.....and I have ta say that I think this is the best horror film of all time! I thought that every1 in the movie acted very well....I mean i would never EVER play a role like that or nething in it....lol...but it was very good....I mean I started freakin out when she did the lil spider walk down the stairs...AHHHHH that was soooooo scary...kinda..well i thought so..hehe...and o mi goodness when her head turned and the green throw-up...totally gross...but way kool ; ) umm...i dont think ne other movie can top this one...it was the perfect horror film....oh mi goodness im gettin goosebumps talkin bout it...so im goin to end mi opinion...hehe bye bye all!!! :o)
