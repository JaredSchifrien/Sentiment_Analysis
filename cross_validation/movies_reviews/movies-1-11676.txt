This movie was so horrible I am embarrassed that I spent 90 minutes watching it. Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore are out of control. . .why would any one hire a hit man to kill an old lady?? Why would any one even try to kill an old lady?? The whole time I was watching it I wanted to tell them both to get control of themselves. They were both acting like lunatics simply because this old lady was annoying them? Sorry, but thats not funny. Its stupid.
