One of the funniest film I have ever EVER seen. I never laughed so hard in my life. And it was from beginning to end! I know this film isn't high on the list because people are pansey asses and are offended at the drop of a hat. South Park offers no apologeze and must be watched with an open mind and a human sense of humor. The jokes come at you fast and hard and never let up. Next to Cannibal: The Musical, this is Trey Parker and Matt Stones best work.Actually a very intelligent and interesting farce on society and our constant blaming of others instead of looking at ourselves. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
