One of my 3 favorite films. Not so much a war story as a character study surrounded by a war. In the end, you really forget about WWII because you are so interested in what will happen between the characters. Beautifully written, shot, and directed. And the acting, oh, the acting. Alec Guinness gives one of the great performances in cinema. Everyone else is pitch perfect. Underlying symbolism and commentary on war are what makes this film stand out from the rest. Also, one of the best written and exciting last scenes in the movies.
