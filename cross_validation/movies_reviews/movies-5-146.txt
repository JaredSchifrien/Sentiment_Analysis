Can you love a horror movie? If you see this you will. Anthony Hopkins should still be winning awards for this film. I think if I saw him on the street today I would be a little afraid! Each minute of the film builds the suspense and even if you have to cover your eyes at the more graphic parts, the dialogue will carry you through without missing a beat.
