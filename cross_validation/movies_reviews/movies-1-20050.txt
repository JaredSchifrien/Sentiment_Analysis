They had a good concept, to use actors who didn't have scripts (anyone see this as a prelude to all the Reality TV crap that's overrunning the airwaves now?) with handheld cameras. The jerkiness of the picture was irritating, though admittedly necessary for the type of thing they were going for. But that's about all the credit I can give it. I was waiting to be scared, almost fell asleep through it (it's extremely slow-going), and got left sitting down as the theater lights came up and wondered . . . well? When's something going to happen? It might be worth seeing to check out the concepts in the making of the film . . . otherwise, it might be better to pick something else up to watch.
