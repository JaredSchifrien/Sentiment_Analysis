A great movie with the obvious lesson that no matter where you come from you can still choose to walk a path of virtue. The title character can be harsh but has some quirks that make him lovable. The guy'll drink beer and smoke cigars but will also have milk and cookies with a kid after saving some kittens. I wouldn't recommend this movie for CTVFan. Knowing him he'd rate this movie poorly based on the title alone. But instead he would claim that the movie lacks morals and fails to be family friendly.
