This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, let alone horror movies. I have watched this movie so many times I have memorized almost every line. But the one thing that makes me want to watch the movie over and over again is Jack Nicholson...his expressions are hilarious! His acting is second-to-none...one of my favorite actors. This movie proves that a horror movie doesn't have to have blood and guts and all that other good stuff to be scary. I think the idea of being locked in a hotel with my lunatic father who was going to murder me and my mother with an ax and chop us into little pieces is scary enough. This movie is outstanding and I believe it is not only the best horror film of all-time, but also one of the best movies of all-time.
