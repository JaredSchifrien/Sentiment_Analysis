Animal House is one of the greatest comedy movies of all time and time doesn't change that. If you've never seen it, where have you been. If you have, see it again and say the lines as they say them. Bluto and Otter's final speech to get the Deltas fired up to do some damage is still my favorite scene in the movie. So different and so funny.
