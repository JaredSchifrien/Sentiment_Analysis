The Music Man is my favorite musical. Robert Preston just bursts with energy. The movie is terrific from the clever opening song on the train to the end. Shirley Jones was great too what a wonderful voice she had. The movie had a great roster of charactr actors- Paul Ford, Pert Kelton, Hermione Gingold, ,Buddy Hackett and Charles Lane. Plus, let's not forgett Ronnie Howard.
