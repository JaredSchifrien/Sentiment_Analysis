It's the Beatles! Guys, of course it's great. The animation is neat and kind of psychedelic. The music is taken from Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour and (I think) Revolver genre (right?). If you see the new release version there's also a clip that was originally cut out of Hey Bulldog. The movie is funny and pretty.
