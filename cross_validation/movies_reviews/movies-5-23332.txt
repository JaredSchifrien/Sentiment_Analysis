If you're looking for Matrix-type special effects, this movie isn't for you. It's a film that uses a SciFi format for a plot that has nothing to do with interplanetary travel - except as the catalyst for the message of the film. It's also interesting to see how filmmakers in 1950 envision a spaceship (interior and exterior).
