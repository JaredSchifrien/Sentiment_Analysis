This movie was outstanding and such a great movie for children to watch. The Dwarfs were cute and loveable to watch especially DOPEY! He was so funny and his pointed ears just wants to make you smile. Of course in just about every movie this is a source of evil and that was Snow White's step mom. How truly evil she was. How on earth why would a mom kill her child just to be the most fairer in the world. Overall it was incredible to watch.
