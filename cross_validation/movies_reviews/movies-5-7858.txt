One of the great ones. As a comedy, I'd give it 4 stars b/c, to me, it wasn't hilarious laugh out loud funny, but as a movie in general it gets the full 5 STARS! As usual Nicholson does what he does best, he acts. Helen Hunt just seems so fake and she seems to over dramatize. Also in it is Cuba Gooding Jr. and Greg Kinnear who play their parts well. The dog is without doubt the best character in the whole story. He's just SOOO cute!
