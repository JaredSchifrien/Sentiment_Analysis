This movie definitely disturbed me (not as frightening as reading the book though). This is a timeless horror flick. No matter what new special effects come out, Exorcist will always be horrifying. It plays more on you mind that blatant blood and guts of so many horror movies. I hear it is based on a true story which makes it even more freaky.
