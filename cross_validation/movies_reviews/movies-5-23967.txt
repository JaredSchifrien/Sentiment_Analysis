Another Great Trek movie! That makes 9! This one, like the previous 2, focuses on the cast from the awesome The Next Generation. In this one, the crew has to fight the bad guys trying to gain immortality by relocating an entire population of people on a planet. Mixing well-timed humor with references to other Trek shows, great special effects, heart-warming character moments and blood-pumping battle sequences, Insurrection is a success from beginning to end.
