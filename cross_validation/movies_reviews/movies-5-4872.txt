Though deadpanned by the critics, I have always thought it was underrated. A terrific family film, Steven Spileberg once again creates a magical world to immerse yourself into. Dustin Hoffman is utterly perfect as Capt. Hook and Robin Williams somehow succeeds in transforming into Peter Pan. Full of color, a wonderful score and touching story, it attempts to tell the untold story of whatever happened to Peter Pan. A joy to watch as a family.
