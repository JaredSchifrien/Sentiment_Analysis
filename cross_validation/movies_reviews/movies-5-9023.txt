John Cusack stars in this wonderful teen comedy.Cusack is dumped by his girl for his archrival and decides to kill himself.Hilarity results.The paperboy chases are kickass. The same director Savage Steve Holland also directed Cusack in One Crazy Summer with an early appearance by Demi Moore.It has several of the same actors as slightly different people. Both are highly recommended.
