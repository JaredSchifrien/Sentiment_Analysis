This film should have been subtitled No minorities were injured in the making of this film. The movie almost brings up real issues (oil companies and dams and corporate America), but then quickly turns back to the cheesy romance and good guy/bad guy senario. Funny how the bad guy is the South American revolutionary and the good guy is the rich white American male. And somehow they manage to blame it all on drugs. Obviously those minorities only want to hold people ransom and attack the oil project so they can protect their cocaine crop. And somehow they manage to make it be okay to go shoot the minorities if they are saving a couple of white guys. Talk about cultural insensitivity and racism. The movie simply enforced age-old stereotypes.
