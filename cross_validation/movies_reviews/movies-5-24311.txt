Although the first one was much, much better, this film I found to be very entetaining. Of course, very, very, very few films will ever come close to being as good as the first JP, so I wouldn't mark tgis film down just because it's predesscor was better. This film had the best special effects out of the three, although it's plot lacked. The only thing that pissed me off aboput the movie was that Spinosaurus defeated the T-Rex. No way could that happen! Some finned- fish eater can't take thanimal wuith the strongest jaw in the history of thre world. That is a hard scene to swallow for me. But overall, this film did have what the 2nd lacked- Sam Niell. Niell is kinda of the man who makes JP what it is anyway. And plus Spielberg, the best filmaker ever without a doubt, didn't direct this, so you can't expect it to compete with the first one. The fourth movie is starting preproduction now, and some of you are already fretting. Spielberg has come up with the idea this time and Michael Crichton will most likely be writing it......so it will be good. Sam Niell is iun talks of returning to reprise his role as Alan Grant again, as are Jeff Golbloom and Richard Attenborough. Finally, that original cast reunited. And for those of you who say the series should be ended, in the Universal contract from like 1992, they is a total os six movies to be made. And if they sell well, they may just renew the contract for a further six film. I'll get back to the series should be ended at about Jurassic Park 12.
