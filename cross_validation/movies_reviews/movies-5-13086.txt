I think, although i am slightly biased to comment on this film because i am jewish, you can not argu the fact that it is a powerful film, and filled with bold statements such as the girl in the red coat that appears at certain moments, but the film its self, which (forgetting what it stands for alone) is so well crafted,directed and acted, the fact that it is based on the holocaust is irrelevant, because it is so amazingly powerful, gripping, and truly amazing. A film i will always watch!
