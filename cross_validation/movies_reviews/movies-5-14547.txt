If you are looking for a feel good movie with a happy ending, this isn't the movie to go watch. It is more of a one man performance and Hanks is simply brilliant as always. He has become that man we love to have sit next to us and we always love to hear him speak. While I would have loved to see a little more inbetween time, I loved the movie and was on the edge of my seat for the crash scene. Hanks has reached such I high level in acting ability that he is reaching a point where we will be disappointed in anything that isn't a 5 star movie.
