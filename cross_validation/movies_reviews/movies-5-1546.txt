This is one of the best films in the last 10 years. Infinately better than Titanic (eughhhh), and a great crime movie, L.A. Confidential is a mature thriller that delivers the goods. Very similar to Chinatown, but how could that ever be a bad thing? In my opinion, damn good. A must-see. Summary: A MATURE THRILLER THAT CERTAINLY DELIVERS THE GOODS.
