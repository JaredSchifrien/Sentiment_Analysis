This is my favorite movie of all time.How this didn't sweep the Oscars is beyond me.Bogart,Walter Huston, the father of the director and the grandfather of Anjelica, and Tim Holt star.Two disillusioned drifters decide to enlist the aide of a grizzled prospector and search for gold in the Sierra Madres in Mexico.Walter Huston has a forboding speech concerning the evil that gold can do.The men start out on a long and arduous trek into the mountains. All is well until the gold starts piling up.This movie shows the changes that a person undergoes in life.The scene where each man repeatedly goes out into the night to make sure their gold stash is still safe sets the tone for the rest of the movie.They survive banditos,Indians and others looking to take a piece of their action.But can they survive themselves?
