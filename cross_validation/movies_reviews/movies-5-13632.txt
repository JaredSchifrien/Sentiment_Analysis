This film is brutal in it's portrayal of racism, prejudices, and the consequences thereof. This is certainly not a film for the average viewer; many scenes run you over like a freight train. If racism offends you, you should see this film. If a blunt treatment of racist ideas is not your cup of tea, I still think you should see this film since it takes on these ideas in a frank manner. The reviewer known as newsoul would be well served to watch this film.
