Ah Halloween. The first of the series that pulled us in and held us tight. I can t remember a Halloween I didn t like ok maybe the latest one, Halloween Resurrection. But that movie lack the sophistication that the others had. It was to modern , I guess, for me. I liked the old feeling that you get when you don t know were the killers coming from. That s what I liked most about this one anyway. I thought it had a certain quality to it that made it special, made it different from all the others. Maybe it was the wonderful performance by Jaime Lee-Curtis? Perhaps the eerie look of Micheal Meyers? Who knows. All I know that it definitely set the stage for horror movies everywhere. Just look at all the cheap rip-offs like Friday the 13th and Scream. And to think, pore ole John Carpenter only had 300,000 bucks to film and produce the movie. I dare you to say that he would be half as good off as he is now without Halloween. Summing up, Halloween is the best horror film of its time, of our time, and will probable continue to be good for years to come.
