Although not the computer-generated perfection that was Toy Story 2, Finding Nemo is just plain great. The character of Dory gets a laugh from every line of her dialogue. And, then, there is the hilarious scenes in the dentist office and the seagulls. I have to ask though: If this is a Pixar film, where are the outtakes?
