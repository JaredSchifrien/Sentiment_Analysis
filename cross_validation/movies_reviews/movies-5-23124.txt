This movie is one of my favorite if not my favorite. The dialouge is so inventive and shows the realization of an adolescent that growing up isn't so bad. The performances were amazing Jennifer Connelly was amazing and David Bowie was mesmerizing and there is still much to be said about his choice of costume.
