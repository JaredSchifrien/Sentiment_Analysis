The original, a classic! I remember the first time I saw To Fly as a kid at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. Walking into the theater and seeing that awesomely huge screen, literally holding onto my seat as my eyes were flooded with scenes of the world as seen from above. Feeling like I was flying with the birds. I will never forget how that felt.
