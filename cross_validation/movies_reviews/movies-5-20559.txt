this movie is one of my very favorites! The movie is about the silent screeen era that is on the brink of going to talkies.It is well acted, has some terrific dance numbers. It is very funny in parts.Actors trying to adapt to a microphone. Jean Hagens funny voice. Wonderful dance numbers. It is hard to believe that Debbie Reynolds had never danced before this movie. She did a good job in her role. I always enjoy watching Gene Kelly dance. and Donald O'Connor was great as well. I have lost count how many times I have seen this movie.
