This movie was well developed. Connery's performance was fantastic, and Robert Brown is a natural. While the story was predictable, the relationships formed were very touching. The actors conveyed the feelings of the characters seemlessly to the screen, and the story was well formed and thought out. The young boy is put under pressure to which anyone can relate, and nothing is left in question. This movie is one of the reasons why I go to see movies.
