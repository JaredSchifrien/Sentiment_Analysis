Yet another great movie for the John Travolta fan. With cameos by Bruce Willis and a host of other actors, Pulp Fiction uses destruction, swearing, and death to portray a remarkably entertaining movie. Samuel L. Jackson also provides a strong character and delivers lines that everyone will and has been saying. Not for the weak at heart!
