I love Carrie. However, I am disturbed by what she had to go through. Carrie White is a tormented and made fun of high school girl. People throw tampons at her. The walls are spray painted with the nasty words Carrie White Eats Sh*t! And no one seems to even care that this girl is being unfairly treated. Not even this girl's mother. Unbeknownst to them, Carrie has telekinesis. Basically, in simpler words, She's going to kill them. And they're going to die a very gory death. What I like about this film is that it does not justify or promote what Carrie or her tormenters do. Every bad thing the characters do come back to haunt them. And unfortunatley, Most of them suffer at the hands of Carrie. But in a way, We can't really blame her. The girl gets viciously abused at home, thrown coffee on, shoved, pelted with tampons, and told to eat sh*t every day. So it's no wonder why she strikes back at these ruthless tormentors. It may not be right, but we can sympathize with her for the hell she endured.
