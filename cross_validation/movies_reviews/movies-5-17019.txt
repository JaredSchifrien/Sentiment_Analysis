i don't understand how people could not like this movie.people look too hard to find some deep meaning, but there is none. its just a morbid, comical look at 80's yuppie lifestyles. this movie is hilarious.christian bale was the perfect person to cast for this movie. i highly recomend that you see this movie with your friends, i guarantee you will laugh your asses off.
