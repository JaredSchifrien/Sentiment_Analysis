My favourite movie of all time. This movie is funny, heartbreaking and romantic. It's defiantely one for the ages. It is fabulous, with amazing sets, dance, music and two great stars, in particular Ewan McGregor. This movie is great to see with a boyfriend/girlfriend and of course if you love any of the lead actors. Luhrmann mixes a musical with such vibrant colour, energy and originality that it will keep you wanting more. It's a fun film that at some points will leave you smiling and laughing from ear to ear, e.g. the juke and his fabulous 'Like a Virgin' number. It will also make you cry or at least be moved by the powerful performers where you actually believe these people are in love. Just to round off, it is a story about beauty, freedom, truth and love, Overcoming all obstacles . A fun movie, especially for hopeless romantics.
