I am a big musical fan. and The Music Man is one I have loved watching since childhood. Robert Preston is perfect as Harold Hill. Shirley Jones was good too. Ronnie Howard was just adorable. the tunes are clever. I do not think I will ever be able to sing along to You've got Trouble LOL A good movie about a con artist who tries to sell the idea of boys bands with the think method. Falls in love with the piano teacher.
