John Huston makes a great Heart of Darkness in reverse movie. My criticism is that Bogart always played the same character, and Kate Hepburn was always mildly annoying. What is fun is to compare Guide Us Now oh Great Jehovah, performed by Robert Morely and Kate at the beginning of the movie with the Welsh version, Cym Rhondda, sung by the miners in How Green was My Valley? The film is notable for being filmed on location.
