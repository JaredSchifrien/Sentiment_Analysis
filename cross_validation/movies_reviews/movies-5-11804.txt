This movie was hilarious to anybody who's been involved with environmental politics at the grassroots level. Probably the humor is too inside for many people to appreciate, and perhaps a little too dark and dry. I personally couldn't stop laughing from the opening scene to the very last lines: "Should I bring my own chains?" A: "We always do." Hoffman and Lilly Thomlin made an incredible team as the "existential detectives." I guess you just had to be "there."
