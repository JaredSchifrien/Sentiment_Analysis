This movie rocked and raised the bar for action and special effects. Not only that, but it was actually better than the first one. Linda Hamilton was a bad ass, and it is nice to see her character evolve to an independant woman from a damsel in distress. Good twist on Ahhhhhnold character. Also, show's that a bad guy (Robert Patrick) doesn't have to be 6 feet tall and muscle bound to be strong, effective and intimidating.
