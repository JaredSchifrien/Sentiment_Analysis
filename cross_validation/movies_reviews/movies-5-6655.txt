Based on Victor Hugo's novel, this one definitely goes down as a classic. The make-up work on Quasimodo's face is so well done- haunting to look at today, imagine what it looked like to people 80 years ago! The scenes of Quasimodo's torture are so dramatic, and most of the acting is excellent. Not everyone knows, however, that the real story ends with an image of Quasimodo and Esmerelda's decaying skeletons holding each other...
