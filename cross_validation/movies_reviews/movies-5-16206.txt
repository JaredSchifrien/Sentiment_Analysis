The movie is basically about David Dunn(Bruce Willis) who does not know his place in the world and finds out about it through the helps of Elijah Price(Samuel L Jackson), eventually Dunn finds he has just never gets sick or get hurt like he's immortal. The ending was very unexpected just like the Six Sense, so i'm not gonna spoil the movie. But this is really genius film making, great story, visuals, and the acting is top notch....nuff said!
