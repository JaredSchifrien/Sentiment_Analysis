John Cameron Mitchell may have stolen the show to get recognition and the MOST POSSIBLE CAMERA TIME, but he deserves every single frame. This movie is hilarious, touching, and genuinely interesting. As opposed to its assumed predecessor THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, this film actually explores gender stereotypes instead of just portraying them as what they are at face value. This is the only movie EVER that I have left the theater ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE that I loved it.
