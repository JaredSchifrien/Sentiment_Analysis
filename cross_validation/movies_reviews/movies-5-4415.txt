Easily the best claymation production ever created, Chicken Run is highly imaginative and very well done. The plot is simple enough--chickens want out and bad guys don't want them to do so. Throw in an American rooster (Mel Gibson, in what is arguably his best movie), and you've got a great set-up for comedy. Although much of the humor is inspired zaniness and dumb villains, there are some clever pop culture references, the best of which is an uproarious reference to the Original Star Trek series.
