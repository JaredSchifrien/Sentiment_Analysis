This movie is just silly and I love it. Peter Sellers does a hilarious job in all three of his parts. This movie has some of my favorite images like Dr. Stragelove trying to suppress a Nazi salute, the insane officer firing a belt fed machine gun at his own troops, yelling Feed me! , and of course the cowboy riding the ICBM. Overall, hilarious and one of my all time favorites.
