Quite thrilling and suspenseful. This is not really a film to watch more than a few times, largely because knowing how it ends kills the fun of watching the movie. The film is well-written, and the acting is solid, although it could have been better. Catches the audience's attention from the very beginning and effectively keeps it until the screen flades to black. A solid suspenseful thriller that regenerated the ailing horror film genre after a long series of losers.
