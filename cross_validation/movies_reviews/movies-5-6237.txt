John Huston truly was great. This is his FIRST film, and it is one of the all-time classic masterpieces of the screen. Humphrey Bogart in the role that made him a star (yes, there was once a time where he wasn't the most famous face that was ever on a movie screen). A great cast of supporting characters. Scratch that, an UNFORGETTABLE cast of supporting characters. A weasly, sleazy criminal (Peter Lorre), a talkative fat man (Sydney Greenstreet), his rodent-like henchman (Elisha Cook Jr.), and a mysterious woman (Mary Astor) who turns out to be more dangerous than she actually is. A must-see for all movie fans. A movie that straddles the great divide between movie and cultural moment .
