I first watched this movie last summer, and I'm ashamed I didn't watch it earlier! A Fish Called Wanda is one of the %#$#! funniest movies I've ever seen! I was laughing so hard, I could have passed out! Kevin Kline interrogating Michael Palin about Nietzche (sp?) while shoving chips up Palin's nose and scooping fish out of the fish tank, and John Cleese jumping around tossing his clothes off and speaking Russian are two of the most ludicrously funny images ever put on film.
