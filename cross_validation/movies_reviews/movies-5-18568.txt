 This is one of the only two movies that have ever really frightened me. I saw this in second grade it genuenly took my nerves to the breaking point. I finally got up the nerve to see it again in sixth grade and realized this is one of the better haunted house stories ever put to film. Written and produced by Steven Speilberg and directed by the master of the macabre Tobe Hooper the genius behind The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This film is not just about fright but about family as well. It is as heart warming and funny as it is scary. I highky recommend this film.
