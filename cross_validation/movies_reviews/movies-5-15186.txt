A movie where the characters take central focus. Viewers don't even have to know, care or like horses or horse races. Seabiscuit and his jockey Red Pollard are both down and out angry souls. Tobey Maguire is excellent as Red Pollard as he portrays his hurt, anger and pride. The horse and the jockey understand each other and it shows. Jeff Bridges is superb as Charles Howard, the man who takes Pollard in and never gives up on both of them. The real stand out is Chris Cooper as the reticent horse trainer Tom Smith. The horse racing scenes are wonderful, but the movie does right to focus on the lives and interaction of the three men. It is a great movie of perserverence.
