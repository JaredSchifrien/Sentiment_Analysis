I can be such a girlie - I admit, parts of this made me cry (I know, pathetic) I thought this was a really sweet little story about a litle group of misfits who usually wouldn't have anythhing to do with eachother - but bond due to one little, cute human baby. The animation is really good and Denis Leary is great Diego and the character Sid is soooo sweet. Another great film that kids and adults can watch and enjoy together.
