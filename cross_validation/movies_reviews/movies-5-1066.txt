Amazingly original (I don't care if it was based on a true story). By far the Coen's best film. Acting turns by Steve Buscemi, Frances McDormand, and Bill Macy all sublime. Superb writing and direction by the Coens. What other movie packs as much suspense, social satire, thrills, and hilarity into such a tight package? I can't think of one.
