I truly thought the movie was great, my wife had seen it a year ago and raved about it, I just saw it recently and was very impressed...I enjoyed all the characters, thought the acting was superb and it was definitely Kevin Spacey's best performance to date (has put in several good performances). It was a sad look at our society, but quite thought provoking...Great ending!
