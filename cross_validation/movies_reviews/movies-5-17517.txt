Peter Weir Australian made this flick with a young Mel Gibson. Two young Aussies are in the ANZAC forces that fight in the Gallipoli Peninsula disaster. The Turks almost blow them back to Australia as the singer notes in the song, "The Band Played Waltzing Matilda." Hard to watch as you cringe over such waste!
