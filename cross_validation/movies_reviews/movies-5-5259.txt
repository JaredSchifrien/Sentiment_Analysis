Whoever rated this low is obviously in denial... c'mon, did you honesly not love this epic as a kid??? I know I sure did and I just turned 24 today!!! (10-02-80) Whenever I grew up I watched this movie at least a dozen times and NEVER got sick of it and never will. After the house drops... after the tornado, she emerges inside of a colorful OZ that is the most beautiful thing ever witnessed on t.v. GREAT!!!
