One of my favourite films! OK it took on a difficult plot but it handled it pretty well despite a few logic gaps, although I wish they'd worked something else out for when Neo comes back to life at the end. But enough of that. Fanatastic innovative use of special effects, the baddest fight scenes I can ever remember seeing in a film, a dash of mysticism with Morpheus, The One, the Oracle, a great bad guy in Agent Smith and action scenes that blow your mind. This film will be THE benchmark for action flicks for the next twenty years.
