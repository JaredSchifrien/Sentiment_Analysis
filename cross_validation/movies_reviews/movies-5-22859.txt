The first X-Men movie was plain awful. It didn't even stay true to either the comic book or cartoon and I was so disappointed. Where was Jubilee, Gambit and Beast? I walked away feeling that I just witnessed a poor episode of a washed up sci-fi TV programme. X2 however gave me the pleasure of sitting in my seat five minutes after the movie finished with my eyes still rolling from a visual feast of fresh character development, good special effects and a good story. With a few minor glitches (The absence of Beast, Gambit and Jubilee, Rogue and her romance with Iceman when really it should have been Gambit) I managed to overlook these small flaws and just appreciated a good movie.
