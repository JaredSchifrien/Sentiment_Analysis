Magnolia is one of those films. You know THOSE films, the one which make you think about them for weeks on end, the kind of film where you find yourself the next day, wondering absentmindedly whether that character is going to be okay, the kind of film which complicates your life. This is, of course, a sure sign of a spectacular movie, as any self respecting critic will tell you, and Magnolia is no exception. The cast is well chosen and each member gives a wonderful performance, and the way in which the script does not allow any one actor to steal the limelight works for the film rather than against it, as it might so easily have, as every one of the main cast is excelent. The direction is truly brilliant, and P T Anderson keeps up his reputation for taking risks and trying new things, as he gained from his previous picture 'Boogie Nights.' What other director would have the entire main cast spontaniously start singing half way through the movie? - The soundtrack, it is worth mentioning is good, and compliments the movie well. If there is any bad point about Magnolia the it could only be the commitment required to sit down and watch it. The film is very intense and for three hours-ish this can be exhausting, and so this is not one to watch lightly, but I advise everyone to make that commitment as Magnolia is an absolute masterpiece, definately my favourite film of the year, probably my favourite film of all time. Its one of THOSE films.
