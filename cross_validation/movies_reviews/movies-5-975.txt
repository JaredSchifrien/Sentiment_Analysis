When I first saw this movie, I was 12 years old. I remember that the same weekend that I saw it, my room was getting painted, and I had to sleep downstairs in the living room on an air mattress. All night long, I drifted in and out of sleep thinking that I was floating on an inflatable raft in the middle of the ocean with a 25 foot long Great White circling me. Not my best night's sleep ever, but an excellent, classic movie.
