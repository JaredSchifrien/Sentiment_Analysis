for me, it is probably the most brilliant and intelligent movie ever made, with such a wonderful cast and director. I recommend you to watch the kiss'scene and listen to what they say with a second degree. I 'm so chocked john Woo dared take the subject of this chef d'oeuvre for such a average movie as MI2. But every one should see THIS WONDERFUL FILM.
