A group of five of us went to see this movie, and only one of us walked out liking this one. Not even the person who first suggested it liked it!! Matt Damon and Gwenyth Paltrow were absolutely wonderful, but it would have been even better had they had a good script to work with. The same thing happened over and over, and I think Mr.Ripley's personality confused even himself. It was mundane, boring, and the worst movie I've seen since The Crying Game !
