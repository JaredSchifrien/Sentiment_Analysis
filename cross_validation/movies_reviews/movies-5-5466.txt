The best Hitchcock movie. How this gets rated lower than Psycho, which is horrifically overrated, is beyond me. Cary Grant at his smooth-talking best, Eva Marie Saint is beautiful and stylish as the damsel in distress, and James Mason does a wonderful job portraying the slick, urbane criminal. From the acting to the cinematography to Bernard Herrmann's score, this movie is perfection.
