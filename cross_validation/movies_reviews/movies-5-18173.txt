This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It started off my zombie craze. The newer version of Dawn Of The Dead may have more action and special effects, but it lacks the awesome mood and environment present in the original, as well as its underlying message. The characters in the original are also better developed in my opinion, and there is great dark humor present in this original version as well. The theatrical release is great, but if you can, get the Director's Cut, because it sets the movie up better, and includes some scenes that seem sort of integral to the film once you have seen both the theatrical and Director's Cut releases. The newer version was exciting and well-done; I like it, too, but the original can't be beat. George A. Romero made a masterpiece when he made Dawn Of The Dead.
