An excellent film with some powerful, heart-wrenching performances. Four Nazi judges are on trial for using their court for Nazi atrocities. The question becomes should they be held accountable? A superb cast which include Spencer Tracy, Maximmilian Schell, Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, Montgomery Clift, Judy Garland and Marlene Dietrich. Clift is absolutely heartwrenching as the victim of sterilization, and gives one of the best performances of his career. Garland also is amazing. Schell rightly deserved the Academy Award for his powerhouse performance as the defense attorney.
