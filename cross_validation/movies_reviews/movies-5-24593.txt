This is easily the best movie that I've seen in years. Brilliantly creative and awesomely stylized, this amazing creation should easily sweep the Oscars this year (although Spider-Man 2 might put up a good fight). The acting is great, with Jude Law playing the hero and the beautiful Gwenyth Paltrow playing the Lois Lane-type. The action and combat scenes are astounding, and easily rival those of the original Star Wars movie and the best episodes of Voyager and Enterprise. The dialgoue is great, with lots of humor sprinkled throughout--including an uproarious running gag involving a camera. The imagination in this movie is seemingly boundless, as robots, planes, sea vehicles, air bases, and more lurk around every corner. A classic story of good vs. evil, Sky Captain and the World of Tommorow could easily be the best movie of 2004.
