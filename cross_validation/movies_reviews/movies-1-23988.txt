Steven Spielberg missed the mark. Stanley Kubrick missed the mark. How many must? This film is bad. A modern day retelling of Pinoccio, this film leaves much to be desired. It is not lack of good effects, or dialog. I was just board. The film was not anything like what I had expected, and I felt it was a mockery of what might be. The entire film has a wholly surrealistic quality which I found very bothersome, and the end is anticlimactic with a major let down.
