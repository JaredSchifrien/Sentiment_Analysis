WOW! What a stinko! This movie was praised as being entertaining. That tells you where Hollyood has gone. I guess anything that isn't a remake of a 1950s movie, or a sequel, is considered original and therefore good. Hollywood needs scriptwriters bad! The person who wrote the sreenplay for Lost in Translation probably didn't even graduate from High School. This movie is simply awful.
