It was a powerful book and an equally powerful film. I thought David Morse was especially good in his role. This movie nearly changed the way I look at the death penalty and death row in this country. My favorite scene is when John is watching the movie of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and tears are streaming down his face. Michael Clarke Duncan gave a very powerful performance.
