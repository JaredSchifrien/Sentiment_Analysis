My husband and I watch this parody of a touring heavy metal rock band at least twice a year, and we think it gets better every time we see it. With Rob Reiner narrating, the movie seems legitimate at the start. It quickly unfolds into absurdity, though, with several hilarious scenes that play off the best heavy metal stereotypes- amplifiers that go to 11, drummers that die of mysterious causes, and the soaring signature guitar solos of Nigel Tufnel. So many scenes have us rolling on the floor, like the one at the airport security checkpoint (you have to see this one yourself) and the one where the band is on stage with dancers dancing around a miniature Stonehenge (a result of a measurement misunderstanding). Believe it or not, this movie also features an all-star cast, including Billy Crystal, Dana Carvey, Fran Drescher, Bruno Kirby, and Anjelica Huston, among others. So if you haven't seen this movie, go straight to your video store and TAP INTO AMERICA! You won't be disappointed.
