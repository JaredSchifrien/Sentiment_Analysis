This is one of my favourite movies. Lisa Kudrow is fantastic, as well as, the oscar-winning Mira Sorvino. It is a classic-humoured, most entertaining movie that you can watch again and again. It is stupid, but that's what makes it funny and what makes you laugh. It also, allows u to dream and wish about your high school and what your future reunions will be like, (a bit of inspiration if u like). Overall, exceptional and entertaining. A must c movie that's great 4 a rainy day.
