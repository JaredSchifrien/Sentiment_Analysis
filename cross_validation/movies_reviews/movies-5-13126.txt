This movie shows the saddest history we will ever know. It is the realization that millions of innocent human beings were murdered. I believe it also portrayed how people were incredibly weak to a hidden, sick power (Hitler). Thus, we should be extremely thankful that we live in a diverse and free society. We will never know the true horrors of what these people went through. Sometimes we tend to forget how lucky we are, and it makes me realize that everyday we live is a true blessing. It was a truly sad movie with a most powerful message. The music, composed by John Williams also added to the emotion of the film. How he ever came up with such a composition is purely ingenious. When it was played at my school, for the rememberence day assembly, people gathered around the string students who were playing it. It was a silent and sad moment I will remember for a long time.
