I am white, I love African-American movies that are dramas including drugs, violence and language. Ice Cube is by far my favorite actor, he is brilliant. I remember watching this movie whenever it came out in 1991... whenever I was just 11 and thinking --- WOW!!! Now that I am 24, 11-06-04 --- I understand it alot better and just makes me feel sorry for people living in South Central. This movie is one of the best movies of all time in my book. 2 thumbs up!
