Without question this was the most DOCILE character portrayl I've ever seen Sean Connery play ..Ever...! However, did I mention how beautifully Sean portrayed his character? It was refreshing to see a white honkie become genuine friends with a black kid too. We need to get more of that out here in life... and start letting go of racial prejudice. That garbage has been run in the dirt...! A very touching motion picture, Finding Forester.
