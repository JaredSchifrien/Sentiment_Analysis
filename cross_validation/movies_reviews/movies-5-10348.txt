Jack Nicholson really plugs you in (and what else would you expect?) to this heart-warming film. He plays this man who needs to deal with the inevitable circumstancs of age and retirement which suddenly befall him. Suddenly, he needs to find his way in a life that has become routine and taken for granted. It is sad and at the same time, comic, to see him stumble around in his new shoes. But the rest of the comedy depends on whether or not you're from the country and can roll with the punches. These country characters are over-the-top schlocky. If all else fails, Kathy Bates hot tub debut is fun. Hilarious at times, sad, ultimately uplifting, About Schmidt is a sweet ride.
