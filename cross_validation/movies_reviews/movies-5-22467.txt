A great movie on many levels. First, a wonderful movie. Then, a wonderful Trek movie. The pacing is great. You really undertand WHY Kirk is the captain. His tactics are fantastic. Khan makes a great villain. This is a movie about conflict between the old and the young, fathers and sons, fear of death, growing old, friendship, new beginnings, the blood and guts of war, loss, good vs. evil. The special effects were ahead of their time. There is a distinct Biblical reference, and Milton's Paradise Lost is clearly evident: the Genesis device, Kirk and Carol in the garden of Eden, Kirk eating the apple, and Kirk as Jesus Khan as Satan marshalling their forces and duking it out. When they fight in the nebula, and whn the Enterprise is at red alert, the blood-red backlight is reminiscent of Hell's fire. High adventure, suspense, and an epic sweep. What is stunning is Montalban, Nimoy, and Shatner's skill at taking their acting to the big screen. The TNG cast never could do that well.
