A classic movie. Similiar to the original but I would not call this a remake. The plot borrows from the original story with regard to location and an alien discovery but the similiarities stop there. This move is a powerful combination of frightening events with some gore mixed in and expert handling of suspense and drama. Entertaining and engaging from beginning to end. The acting is very admirable and the ending is magnificent. One of Carpenters best efforts. A must see.
