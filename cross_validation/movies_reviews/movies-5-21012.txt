A wonderful movie the autobiography of Lorretta Lynn. Played to perfection by Sissy Spacek. It starts out when Lorretta Lynn is 13 and takes it through to about her thirties when she is famous and at the top of popularity. It looks like an honest portrayal of this country singer, Tommy Lee Jones was also good as her husband. Sissy Spacek deserved the oscar she won playing this role and she even did all her own singing.
