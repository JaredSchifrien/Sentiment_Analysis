Directed by Frank Capra, It's A Wonderful Life (1946) is one of the few, if not the sole dark films that is considered a Christmas movie. For the uninitiated, the story revolves around George Bailey (James Stewart) who finds himself considering suicide, notwithstanding his numerous selfless acts that has helped his family, friends and hometown. His savior is the angel Clarence (Henry Travers) who shows what his town would have been like if he had never been born. Through the process, George discovers that his seemingly inconsequential life was important after all. The core cast includes Donna Reed as George's supporting wife and Lionel Barrymore as the evil Mr. Potter who wants to control the town. Despite the film being recognized by the Academy, the movie was not a commercial success. In fact, It's A Wonderful Life did not become wildly known until the copyright was allowed to lapse, and the movie entered the public domain. After the lapse, the film was shown repeatedly during the holidays. The bottom line is that It's A Wonderful Life is an American classic that illustrates both the American dream and its challenges.
