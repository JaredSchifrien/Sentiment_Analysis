This movie was the best movie that I've seen this year. I was on the edge of my seat for the whole movie. I loved the way they incorporated the humour and action. The acting was great, the special effects were beyond belief. I don't know what people are thinking when they say this movie is boring. I can name boring movies, and this was not one. DO YOU EVEN WATCH THE MOVIE? The directing was superb and they picked the perfect actors to portray the roles. Jessica Alba was fantastic playing The Invisible Women. And I really liked the Human Torch, wow what a funny guy. Michael Chickless did a superb job, and I've got to hand it to them for not using a lot of CGI to do the Thing. It was perfect. The person who played Doom was great. When I hate a villain so much that I want to get rid of him, the actor did a great job. And last buy not least Mr. Fantastic. He was great too. Like I said, perfect actors for the perfect roles. My favorite scene was the battle between Dr. Doom and the Fantastic 4. Doom sure thought a lot of himself. Do you think you can get rid of the Fantastic 4 that easy? Boring is not the word to describe this movie, the word is FANTASTIC! This movie goes right beside Spiderman and X-Men. I am definately buying this movie the day it comes out on DVD. Heck I may watch it again in theaters. PS: Critics are dumb, I don't think they know a good movie when they see it. Watch this movie, you won't be disappointed. Trust me.
