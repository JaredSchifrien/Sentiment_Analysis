Great movie! Tom Hanks did a fantastic job! Wilson was cool--- though silent. The plane crash was awesome. The island part was a good touch. It showed the harshness that can be encountered by a man that has very little survival skills. I liked the ending. The crossroads idea was great! Of the 4 choices, I believe that I would have followed the pick-up truck. This is definitely a 'must see' movie!
