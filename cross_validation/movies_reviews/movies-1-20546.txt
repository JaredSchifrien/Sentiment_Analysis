Worst sporting event ever! I was told that a Nascar event was the place to see hot tail, sadly I was mistaken. The women looked like what I expected them to look like and whats up with the confederate flag? I tried to watch it because I heard it was so exciting, but I feel asleep on lap 20! I think to enjoy Nascar, you need to be intoxcicated, and I felt that these drivers were trying to hard to act like tough guys. Hey buttholes, stop wasting our precious fuel and stop calling yourselves athletes. If they're athletes, everyone who drives a car, truck, or a bus is an athlete! When is the last time you looked at a bus driver and thought that this guy is the Michael Jordan of bus driving? Never! Plus, Nascar never goes off on time, so it causes me to miss my favorite show The Simpsons. I just want to race daddy I just want to race!
