In my opinion, perhaps the best movie of all time, not just in the sci-fi genre. It is everything the art of cinema should be all about - compelling story, characters with depth and most importantly the kind of visuals that only cinema can provide. Ridley Scott, for all of his fame, is still underrated. Also, two things about that movie that give it more of a story. The first is that I think the original cut of the movie with Harrison Ford's narration is equally as compelling as the director's cut. It was, in part, a detective movie and the narration is a classic element of that. The second is that I had bumbled around for many years trying to find that haunting soundtrack by Vangelis. Apparently, it wasn't until 1994 that some contractual dispute was settled and it was finaly released. What movie of this ones calibre would allow that to happen in this day and age.
