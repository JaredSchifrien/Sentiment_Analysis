One of the things I hate most about old movies that people talk about being great is they claim one of the reasons as being ahead of its time. Well since I wasn't around then it is very difficult for me to appreciate those movies people acclaim as being revolutionary. What is so great about Casablanca is that people can watch it for the first time today and without having any idea about what things were like when it was made fall in love with it. It is so simplistic that nobody would probably think of making a movie like it now. However, sometimes being simple yields success. A love story, with suspense, and a very different setting from any movie I've ever seen. Finally an old movie that is good for some reason other than it is old. It truly is a masterpiece.
