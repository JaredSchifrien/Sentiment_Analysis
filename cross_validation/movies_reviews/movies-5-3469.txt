One heck of a movie. The 'sequel' to The Fugitive is better than its predecessor. It stars , once again, Tommy Lee Jones as the foul mooded U.S. Marshall, this time chasing Wesley Snipes. The action is better than the first with some great chase scenes. A definite thriller for those in for some action. One word of caution - this is probly not for kids, as their is plenty of profanity and some gory violence scenes.
