this is one of my favorite movies. ive seen it many times over the years since it came out over 20 years ago. its a surreal look at the new york gang life. the warriors and every other gang in new york were invited to send 9 delegates from their gang to represent them at a meeting called by cyrus the head of the biggest gang in new york. he wanted to try to unite everyone so they could take over the whole city. but what happens is a scumbag lowlife shoots cyrus and all hell breaks loose and cops begin showing up and the lowlife to keep the blame from him starts yelling and pointing to the leader of the warriors who had been seperated from his friends that he was the one who shot cyrus and he then is surrounded and though not shown you know he has been beat to death. the remaining warriors now have to make it back to coney island in the middle of the night and the truce that was on when they went to the meeting is now off and though they dont know it yet they have every gang in new york looking for them including the ones that killed cyrus. the gangs they meet up with are strange but they are meant to be exxagerations. my favorite scene is when they are on the train back to coney island and those couples get on who look like they just came from the prom and they look at the warriors with fear and misunderstanding. they get off the train so quickly at the next stop one of the girls drops a flower and swan picks it up and gives it to the girl that managed to tag along with them on their journey. to me it says you dont know me just by looking me and you have no place to judge me if you haven't walked a mile in my shoes. most people couldn't handle walking a block in my shoes and i would never wish on anyone that curse. nobody is better than anyone else we just have different lives and made better choices.
