I cannot even begin to describe how truly amazing this film is. A far cry from the tripe awful sequels that spawned from what could only be described as a great mind maze of pure genius. The Matrix is completely different to the sci-fi pre-decessor genre and there was truly no film before that reached the cinematic heights of parody - bullet-time (Slow-motion scenes) Shrek, The Centre Park commercials etc, special effects and even storytelling. It hails many questions about our minds and our constant reliance of computers, the world we live in and the many questions that still haven't been answered.
