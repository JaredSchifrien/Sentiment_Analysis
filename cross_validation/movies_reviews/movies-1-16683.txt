It is hard for me to give this film a very high rating.As great a cast it has and as wonderful as the performances may be, it lacks any positive or happy moments. There is not one redeming quality about the feeling you get from this picture. Do you like to watch family and loved ones go through complete anguish and misery? Every up turn in this movie does a complete and horrible down swing towards an unimaginable worse. From brothers watching their brothers die, to husbands watching their wives get shot, this is without a doubt the most pointlessly depressing movie ever made. What do you get from it? I walked out of it when I saw it in sixth grade. I tried to watch it a year ago in my Junior year in high school and found it almost as unbearable. The cast and crew do a wonderful job at creating this beautiful looking nightmare worse than any horror film I have ever seen. This movie has no message except that life sucks, there is little good in the world, and in the end after nothing but sh*t happens to you your entire life, a bear will eat you and people will say it was a good way to go. What a pointless and negative message.
