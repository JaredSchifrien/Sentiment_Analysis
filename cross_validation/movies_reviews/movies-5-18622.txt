This film was one of the best in the past few years especially in this genre. While it's difficult to label it 'horror', it certainly doesn't lack in suspense. Based on a popular foreign fim, it has a fantastic storyline carried by a strong cast. Kidman shines as the neurotic, anxious mother and the children are surprisingly talented. I actually wasn't bored by this film at all and I thought the director did wonderfully at creating the dark, melancholy aura. The plot twists, the subtle jumps it causes and the fine acting all make it a film not to miss.
