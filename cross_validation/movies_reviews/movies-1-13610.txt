I haven't detested a movie so much in a long time; while its good at holding your attention, it fails horribly at being the important movie it sets out to be. It winds up being a confused muddle: lives are tedious until you delve into perverse? there is much to be appreciated in our everyday lives? Which one is it, guys? By trying to straddle both with characters that are absolute cartoons, it comes across as dishonest and shallow.
