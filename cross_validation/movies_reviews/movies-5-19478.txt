One of the creepiest and most suspenseful films to come out in the last decade. I found this film to be amazingly good with a kick-ass script, a good cast and solid directing. It addresses the real issue of religious fanaticism and how far people will go to do what they believe is God's Work . Bill Paxton's character is seemingly normal when one night he wakes his two sons up to inform them that an angel came to visit him and told him that it was his mission to rid the world of all the demons (those guilty of horrible things- i.e. child killers, murderers, etc). Paxton's performance is first class and he manages to put on a very chilling performance. I was also impressed with newcomer Matt O'Leary of Domestic Disturbance fame, and as always, Matthew McCoughnahey gave a great performance as the narrator who tells this story. All in all, this is a suspenseful, edge of your seat-type thriller from start to finish. Highly reccomended!
