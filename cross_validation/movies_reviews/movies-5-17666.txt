The Orpheus legend updated to post-war Paris.The poet's entrancement with an enigmatic,irresistibly sensuous Princess of Death leads him through the mirror to an eerie,unforgettable Otherworld.A truly unique fantasy,landscaped with leather-clad bikers,street cafes,mysterious buildings,bizarre coded messages,vengeful feminists and almost fetishist clothing-helped along by negative images,reverse slow-motion and a feast of imaginative visual effects.One famous critic left the cinema quivering with excitement !
