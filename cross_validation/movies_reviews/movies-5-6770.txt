this is my favourite comedy movie and im not a python fan but i seen this and could not stop laughing i did not get all the jokes but it doesnt really matter there are so many gags going on at once theres always something that keeps you amused(in fits of uncontrolable laughter) and everytime you see it you find more and more little gags going on in the background a true masterpiece. if you see this once and like it you will watch again and again.
