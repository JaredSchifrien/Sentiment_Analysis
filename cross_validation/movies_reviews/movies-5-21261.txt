I thought this film was a greatly crafted little slice of nostalgia. It doesn't try to be an epic, just a fairly faithful-feeling depiction of the ride that a group of kids got to go on when one of their songs catches a wave and becomes a national hit. The One-ders are a typical band playing for the typical reasons - music, money and meeting chicks. They accidentally hit the big time the record company changes their name to the Wonders and they go on a ride to the top, only to fall apart as their record slides down the charts. As Mr. White, the manager says, "The one hit Wonders. A very common tale." There's hardly a wrong note played in the whole thing. Sadly overlooked film on Tom Hanks's resume.
