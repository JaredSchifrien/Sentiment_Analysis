Based on John Grisham's popular novel, The Client largely delivers as a suspenseful thriller. The plot revolves around young Mark Sway (Brad Renfro) who witnesses the suicide of a big time mafia lawyer. However, before the lawyer commits suicide, he confides in Mark and tells him the location of the body of a missing Louisiana senator. What follows is a thrilling ride, as the mafia seeks to silence Sway while ambitious District Attorney Roy Foltrigg attempts to find out what the young boy knows. Meanwhile, Mark seeks the help of an inexperienced lawyer, Reggie Love (Susan Sarandon). The film is quick and thrilling, with very few slow moments in between. Solid performances by all involved, especially the young Renfro, puts The Client over the top as a crime drama/thriller. Overall, The Client is highly recommended.
