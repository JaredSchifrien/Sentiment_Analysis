My Opinion is: I live in Canada, I totaly agree with Mr.Moore on the gun control use, their ethics compared to Canadains, how people live in fear,ect. I blame most of it on Their Media (Everytime you turn around their talking about guns,killings,stabings, and to be prepared for things that are slim to happing,I'm not saying they wont just that they take it out of control)And Bush.... Well he puts the fear in GOD!!! What the hell does he think he's doing??? He trys to make things worse then they really are. anyways..I loved the movie and it rocks!!GO MOORE!!!
