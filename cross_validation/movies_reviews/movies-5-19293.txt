Whoa. That was my first thought at the end of Identity. This movie was able to keep my attention with it's brillant cast and many plot twists. Many a time I thought I had the movie figured out only to have my whole thought process blown away when something new happened. John Cusack did an excellent job playing the lead role, and all of the supporting characters were able to round out the movie well. It is a freaky movie in a more realistic sense, and I would recommend this to anyone who wants to see a scary movie.
