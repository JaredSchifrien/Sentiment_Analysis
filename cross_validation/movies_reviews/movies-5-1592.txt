I don't know about a lot of other people, but I'm not very into pirates. I never saw previews for the movie or anything! My friend invited me to see it and I was thinking, eww, why would I want to see a pirate movie? I went with just because I didn't want to stay home alone. After I got out, I was in love and saw it again and bought the DVD! Then, I remembered that one of the best rides was made after it, too! The cast, setting, everything was wonderful! I really think that you should go see it. Just to let you know, the beginning is a little boring, but you'll hopefully like it. There are a few scarier scenes, but nothing to worry so much about!!!
