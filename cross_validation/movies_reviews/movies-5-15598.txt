When I walked out of Titanic on Jan 2, 1998, I thought to myself that the world is much better off for its extistence. That it was going to be interesting to see how our culture reacted to a big, glamorous epic all about the value of an individual life (set against this horrible spectacle of mass death). Unfortunately, we soon learned that our President was using interns for sex while having phone conversations about sending boys to fight in Bosnia, then finishing himself off in the sink off the Oval Office, and this instead was the defining cultural moment of '98. Oh well, its still a great movie. That scene with the musicians playing a final song, as you see others saying their final goodbyes to the world in modest peace, its completely heart-wrenching. And Leo did a completely amazing job at pulling off a purely good character that doesn't get boring.
