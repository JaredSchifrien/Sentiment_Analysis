This horrid, early 80's fantasy/ sci-fi flick, that I think was a foreign film made in Italy or something, has to stand as one of the worst films of that genre. So bad it's almost, almost watchable in a self tormenting sort of way. It's utterly dreadful, but at least it's better than Battlefield Earth. Slightly reminiscent of Beastmaster, but twenty times worse, and, to sort of recall Dennis Miller's joke about HBO, twenty times as likely to be on HBO or Preview around the clock circa 1983, if you can believe it.
