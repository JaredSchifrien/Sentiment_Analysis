Bad acting, some woman replaced Louis & took all his parts to make Lestat look less gay, didn't follow the book at ALL, Laestat didn't match his character description one bit, Marius is NOT Lestat's creator, vampires are supposed to be elegant & beautiful, not skinhead stoners, & Akasha's death sceen was really overdone.
