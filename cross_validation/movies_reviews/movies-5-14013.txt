I really enjoyed this movie. Matt Damon does a good job playing the tough guy, tormented, working class genius, while Robin Williams (whom I'm not normally a big fan of) is outstanding as the therapist who is only barely keeping it all together. The chemistry between Damon and Williams is why this movie works. With a good story line, excellent acting, and likeable characters - this movie is highly recommended.
