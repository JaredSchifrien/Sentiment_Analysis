I aqbsolutely adore 'Lost Boys' - its one of the ultimate 80's flicks and has a great cast such as Keifer Sutherland, Dianne West, Corey Haim and Feldman and Alex Winter. The music was absolutely fantastic - me and my sisters could sing every song word for word (sad I know) Not one to take seriously, but a definate for a horror film night!
