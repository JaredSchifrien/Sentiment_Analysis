Another Dreamworks animated diaster that just makes animation so they could compete with Disney when they are much worse. It's a Woody Allen comedy who makes loads of jokes for adults not any jokes for kids. The animation just plain sucks( The ants looked liked aliens) while the story is very long and boring. Skip it.
