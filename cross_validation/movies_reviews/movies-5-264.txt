This is an excellent movie and Mel Gibson's finest. Don't be scared away by the length of the film. It has great action and it flies by. You'll also be amazed by how great the large battles scenes are. They may have a little too much violence for some, but they are truly a tremendous directorial feat. Braveheart is funny at times, but is also has a lot of heart.
