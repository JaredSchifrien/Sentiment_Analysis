The greatest horror collection ever made. Written by Stephen King and directed ny George A Romero, this fun and fright filled film pays homage to the great pulp horror comics of yesterday. Five hugely entertaing stories spin a web of delightful mayhem. The first story(Father's Day) is a nifty classic story of the living dead and out and out revenge Featuring the academy Award nominated Ed Harris in a six line role. The second tale starring Stephen King himself is called The Lonsome Death of Jordy Verrill. A funny as well as heart wrenching story of a back woods redneck who dips his fingers in meteor sh*t and has to suffer through the results. Next is Something to Tide You over. This is my favorite. One were you root for the supernatural. Starring Ted Danson and Leslie Nelson, this one is about murder,jealousy and revenge that will have you rooting for the nasty ones and is my favorite of the five. Next is The Crate a sick and twisted gore story about a college janitor who finds a crate from an old Arctic expidition stashed under the basment stairs. What lies inside is still alive, AND HUNGRY. The Crate provides much blood and gore as well as a way to dispose of bitchy embarasing spouses. Lastley is the critter infested story, They're Creeping Up On You. About an anal retentive clean freak millionare who is a complete ass hole to everyone who works for him. He happens to have a phobia of roaches. Hmmmm...what could happen to this sap? Very,very cool movie. Campy and lots of fun to watch. Wspecially with your pals. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Not just for the Leslie Neilson scene either, tootie.
