I loved this cute, funny, adventurous movie. The first one as well is one of my favorite family films. I think my favorite character this time around was Puss-N-Boots! What a riot he was. One of the best scenes was when he made that cute helpless face where his eyes got all big and he put his ears back. LOL THe whole audience said AWWWWWWW... when he did that. Antonio Banderas was really good as his voice. The Fairy Godmother was intriguing too. I was really amazed at how realistic their facial expressions were, especially hers. And that arrogant Prince Charming was alright. Donkey was his usual self. This was cute... ;-)
