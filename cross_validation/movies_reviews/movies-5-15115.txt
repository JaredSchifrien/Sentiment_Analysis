Easily the best American film of 2000, Curtis Hansen's edition of Michael Chabon's Wonder Boys stands out as a classic of modern cinema, with its exotic characters and its absurd story structure. It's innumerable amounts of fun, certainly moreso than the average film of any genre, including fluffy fun movies in the comdy and action genres. A great script, spectacularly acted. The cinematography is superb... The film, for all its absurdity, is rather solid. A masterpiece.
