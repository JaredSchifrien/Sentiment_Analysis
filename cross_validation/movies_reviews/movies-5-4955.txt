I love this movie; I just saw it for the second time last night and it was just as good as the first. I cried during both of the times I saw it. I think it is a very emotional movie. The special effects were wonderful, and it is easy to see that a lot of work and planning was put into this movie. It is good for all ages, boys and girls. My eight year old brother enjoyed the sword fighting and action scenes as much as I enjoyed the rest. I thought the actors were perfect for their parts and they seemed to know a lot about the story and how it should come across. I am a sucker for fantasy and magic, and this movie was definitely right up my alley. I love seeing the fairies and mermaids, even though the mermaids were somewhat darker than I would imagine and the fairies were much more temperamental (Well, maybe that was just Tink)!!!:)
