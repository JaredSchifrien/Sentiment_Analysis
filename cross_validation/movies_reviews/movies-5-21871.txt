Harmless and entertaining fare. I enjoyed it and thought it re-watchable enough to have tuned in more than once when I would see it popup in the TV listings. Christopher Lloyd does his usual excellent job as a bumbling, absent-minded professor not too far removed from the just as goofy Reverend Jim from his Taxi days. Michael J. Fox doing some of his better film work if this guy had been born 10 years sooner he d have been a Disney film regular he just has the face, voice and personality for it. The story was fairly unique and presented in a lighthearted amusing way. I loved the way the family kept fading away when things went wrong in the past. The sequels weren t hideous, but, as sequels often do, got lamer as time went by. Overall, I think it has held up well over the years and is still a fun flick for the entire family.
