Well, this was the first full-length cartoon film, which makes it astonishing that the quality is so high first time around. I love the bit when Snow White says ...and you must be Grumpy! Those seven dwarves had more character in them than thousands and thousands of the performances by real actors we've seen over the years. Amazing!
