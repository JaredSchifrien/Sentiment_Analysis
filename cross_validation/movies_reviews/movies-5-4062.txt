this is just as good as the first Toy Story.Woody accidentally ends up in a yard sale and is stolen by a customer who turns out to be a collector of old toys. he takes Woody with the intention of selling him. Woody finds out he is part of a collection of toys from the 1950s. There was even a kiddie show about him in the 50s. Meets Jessie,and other Woody playhouse Characters. Meanwhile the toys from Andy's house set out to rescue Woody.Some funny scenes, and even sad like when Jessie remembers her special kid who loved her at one time and then gave her away.Another well done movie.
