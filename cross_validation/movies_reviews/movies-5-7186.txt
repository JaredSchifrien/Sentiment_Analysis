Take into consideration the fact that they had a group of people who were largely inexperienced, very little money, and no history of this kind of movie to help carry it, it's that much more impressive how good and funny this movie is. Everything from Porkys to Fast Times at Ridgemont High to American Pie can draw a line from their success to Animal House. Is the success of Animal House over? Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?
