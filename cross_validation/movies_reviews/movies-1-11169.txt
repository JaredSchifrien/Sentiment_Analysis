I can see why Goldmember was panned by the critics. It's a really, really bad movie. My expectations weren't high to begin with, but it didn't even come close to making my trip to the theater worth it. My biggest complaint was that it contained very little new material. Even worse, the old material was stale and even pathetic in places. The plot revolving around Goldmember was uninteresting, and Goldmember was a disgusting old guy who ate patches of dead skin that peeled off his body. (I'm not kidding!) Mike Meyers' acting seemed forced and choppy, and there was no chemistry between him and Foxxy Cleopatra, his female helper. Goldmember lacked the fun, silly feel of the second Austin Powers movie, and the pace was slow. I don't recommend seeing this movie in the theater or on video.
