This must be the best movie of the 90's. From the scene when the doctor and his wife are at the mansion and the lights are glistening, to Cruise walking the streets, or when he is trying to discover what is happening, the whole film is a visual treat. OK, the last scene could be ditched and simply leaves a tired ending, but apart from that the film cannot be faulted.
