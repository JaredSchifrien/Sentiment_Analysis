I'd say that this is one of the few movies where Brad Pitt excels (along with Fight Club) Morgan Freeman is fantastic as always and together you have a brilliant realtionship. This film is extremely dark and full of suspense. Each mrder is gory and you get to hear or see it in great detail. The tension mounts as the film progresses and it certainly has a climatic ending. The music is really good (opening music by NIN) and I love the opening and ending credits. An absolute masterpiece.
