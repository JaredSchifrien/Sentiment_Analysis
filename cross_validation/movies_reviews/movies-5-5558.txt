This is one of two of my favorite movies. Humphrey Bogart was at his very best as the cynical and disillusioned Rick Blaine, who is brought back to life, so to speak, by love and and a cause which is bigger than him. What is amazing about this movie is that the script was written daily. Not even the writers knew how this movie would end. It is a testament to the talent of all involved that this movie was even made, let alone become a classic for the ages. My personal favorite scene was when, Paul Heinred as Victor Lazlo and Conrad Veidt vied for dominance with their respectives patriotic songs. It was an unbelievably inspiring scene. No one but Ingrid Bergman could have portrayed Ilsa, she owned the role. This movie also included one of my favorite character actors, S.Z. Sakall as Carl. It was movie making at its finest.
