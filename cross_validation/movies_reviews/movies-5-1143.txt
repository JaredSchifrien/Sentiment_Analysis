Great adaptation of the novel. Packed in thick, end-to-end. Best line in the movie: "Ryan, some things here don't react too well to bullets. Yeah, me. I don't react too well to bullets." For those into submarines, this one ranks right up there with Crimson Tide and Das Boot (if you use subtitles and not the dubbed version).
