This is a great movie, absolutely hilarious, and if you are a musician (like me), you can relate to at least 1 of the mishaps this band encounters. Everyone involved did their homework in making this mockumentary. After this, I also recommend All You Need Is Cash, which profiles The Rutles (Beatles parody).
