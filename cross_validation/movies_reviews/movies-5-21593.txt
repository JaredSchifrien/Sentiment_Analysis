A masterpiece. Sure, they strayed off the book a little (Glorfindel, anyone?), but overall it was brilliant. Definitely one of the best modern movies in history, with excellent scenery (from my home country :)) great effects and characters (the casting was perfect) and a great story. Here's looking forward to the next two.
