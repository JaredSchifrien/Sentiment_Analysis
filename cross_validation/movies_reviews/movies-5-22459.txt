Easily the best Star Trek film for all the obvious reasons. For me the best part of that movie was the interplay between Kirk and Khan. They chew the scenery with a side of ham to the point of camp and despite that the dialogue they share is the highlight of the movie. Khan...I'm....LAUGHING atthesuperiorintellect.
