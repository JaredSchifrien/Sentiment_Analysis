Jamie Foxx is terrific as Ray Charles. I really did forget he was an actor portraying Ray Charles. Very well done movie it took Ray Charles life until the mid 60s. I liked that it was honest and showed his talent along with his flaws. Very entertaining movie.and we get to hear some of Ray Charles music.
