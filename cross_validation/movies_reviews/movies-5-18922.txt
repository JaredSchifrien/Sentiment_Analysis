This was a very, very good movie because it was informative. The sparks between the priest and the Stigmata girl were gross, what was he thinking? I felt bad for the girl because she started to flip out in public and people thought she wanted to kill herself! The ending was good too, but I didn't understand what happened to her until I watched it a second time!
