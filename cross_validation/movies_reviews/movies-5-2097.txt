Speed is the greatest movie because Keanu Reeves is the star. Sandra Bullock is good to except when she kisses Keanu. Anyway, I loved this movie because of the buildup of tension and excitement. I also like how the villan dies at the end. Blood, guts, decapitation and more blood; makes a great movie in my book. Oh, and the bus rescue/blow up scene was the best. Lots of action, but the love bit between Keanu and Sandra was a bit much.
