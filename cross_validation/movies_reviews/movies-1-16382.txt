If you watch Cruel Intentions and then you watch Dangerous Liasons, you realize the difference that world class actors such as John Malkovich and Glenn Close can make on a film. Unfortunately, the makers of Cruel Intentions selected WB actors, who apparently didn't understand or appreciate the importance of chemistry / dialogue etc. in this movie's plot.
