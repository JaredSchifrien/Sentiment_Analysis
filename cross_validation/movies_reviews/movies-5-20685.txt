This movie is a bona fide classic. At the same time, though, it's a guilty pleasure. As a 31-year old male, it's nothing I go around spatting about that this is one of the essentials, but it is. Plus, those songs are catchy and stick in your head. A doe, a deer, a female deer, ray a drop of golden... see there I go again.
