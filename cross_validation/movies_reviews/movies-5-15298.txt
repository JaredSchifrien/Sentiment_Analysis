I'm giving About a Boy five stars simply because watching it was such an enjoyable experience. The movie is about a swinging bachelor (played by Hugh Grant) who becomes involved in a young boy's life and, as a result, learns to see life in a different way. The movie was sweet without being saccharine, and it was filled with funny scenes. Hugh Grant, an actor I usually avoid, was outstanding in his role. In fact, he and Nicholas Hoult (who played the young boy) made the movie. If you're in the mood for a nice story, some good humor, and excellent acting, check out About a Boy.
