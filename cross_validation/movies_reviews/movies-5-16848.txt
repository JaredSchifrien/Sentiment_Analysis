Cormac McCarthy's All the Pretty Horses was one of the first books tackled by my book club. All of us, to a person, were dismayed when finding out that Matt Damon was going to play John Grady Cole, thinking him not much more than a 21st century Brat Pack-er. Were we ever wrong. He did an incredible job in what I think is the movie of the year. Billie Bob Thornton's direction was incredible, Marty Stuart's music was inspiring and all three actors turned in Oscar caliber performances. I am one of the few people who thought the love story got just as much attention as it deserved. I would have hated to see this movie turn into another Prince of Tides . I loved this movie.
