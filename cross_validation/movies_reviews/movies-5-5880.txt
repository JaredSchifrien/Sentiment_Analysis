I think this will be one of the all time great movie ever made. David Lean's yet another masterpiece after the bridge across river kwai . Excellent portrayal of a great man Lawrence who defies all barriers in uniting the waring Arab's under one fold. He makes the foundation of a nation for them. Peter'O Toole does an extra-ordinary job as Lawrence(unbelievable that this his debut film - how did he miss the Academy award). Anthony Quinn, Alec Guiness and Jack Hawkins, Omar Shariff-full credit to their outstanding performance. No wonder it won 7 academy awards. See the restored version and the extra footage. I would recommend this movie as a Golden collection.
