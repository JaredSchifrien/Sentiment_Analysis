Never even consider renting this movie - it's terrible. Harrison Ford made a rare mistake and agreed to work with a terrible script and one of the most annoying actresses ever (Melanie Griffith). Actually, now that I think about it, he made the same mistake with 6 Days, 7 Nights. Anyway, this movie is a joke and isn't even worth tearing apart.
