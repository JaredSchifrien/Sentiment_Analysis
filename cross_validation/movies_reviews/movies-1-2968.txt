This is the worst example of a violent movie I've ever watched! I hate violent movie, think it's totally unnecessary silly, it's only provoking the society to do more crime. In Hannibal they're eating human brain mass (even a little boy!), they're slicing of the top of a madman's head so on. How can this be entertainment??? 'HughJackman's mate ' must be a very unintelligent man! :-(
