Alice is a twisted 12 year old violently jealous of her younger sister(Brooke Shields)in this absorbing, atmospheric slasher movie. The setting is late 50s New Jersey. The creepiness of things is captured lovingly in small details and great location photography, in an almost Coen Bros tone. and a monstrous landlord(you will never forget this character once you see him in his antique-stuffed apartment surrounded by kittens, eating out of catfood cans, looking like a 500 pound John Turturro.)50s New Jersey Catholic environment is creepily and smartly evoked. Paula E. Sheppard is perfect as the nasty Alice. The way she sticks her tongue out to receive communion is great! Gore is slight, with only 3 stalk-and-stab scenes. A lot of gushing blood in the finale, though. You could call this a classic of its type, since it is far above average in the 70s maniac slasher category.If ya smelllll what the Shape, is roasting!!!
