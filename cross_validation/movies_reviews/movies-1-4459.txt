Wow, I am really in a minority here! But I really don't care. I feel this needs to be said. THIS FILM WAS TRASH! I got it for Christmas and only watched it once. This was nothing at all like the cartoon. I can't believe they consider this a children's movie. Scenes of the Grinch eating the top off of a beer bottle, COME ON!! There is no way I can justify anyone allowing a small child to watch this film! As far as I am concerned, Hollywood has once again butchered a classic.
