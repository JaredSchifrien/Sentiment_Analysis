This was an incredible, engrossing thriller! It's about a man who is trying to avenge his wife's death, however, he was badly beaten and has no short-term memory. He takes photos, writes notes, and tatoos reminders all over his body in order to find the killer. The real kicker is that the scenes are filmed in backwards sequence, so you know the end of the story right at the start of the movie. But...can you figure out the beginning...? This is a MUST SEE movie that you'll be talking about for weeks afterwards.
