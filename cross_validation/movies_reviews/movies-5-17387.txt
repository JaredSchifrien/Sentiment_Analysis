This was one of the most imagineative movies I have ever seen. The storyline and plot were very exciting and kept me interested for the whole movie.I liked the fact that you could see how life could be affected so much just by making a decision one way or the other no matter how small that decision may seem. The acting and cast was one of the best i have ever seen. If you haven't seen Run Lola Run, rent it buy it, steal it. Just see it and you wont be dissapointed.
