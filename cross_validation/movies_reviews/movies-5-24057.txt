Criminally underrated, this first installment of the Star Trek movie saga is scored gloriously and the exploring v'ger's domain theme remains a permanent fixture for fans of sci-fi music. The film's gloriously dark and unknown nature is a welcome departure from the traditional contrived and cheesy nature of the original series it follows. Whilst the long dialouge-less scenes may seem boring to some they are in fact simply cementing the establishment of space and the unknown enemy as mysterious which adds a great deal of dynamic tension to actually uncovering what it all means.
