Awesomely great sequel, surpassing the first. The cast is incredible, packed with great actors like Patrick Stewart, Ian Mackallen, Famke Janseen and Halle Berry. The special effects are incredible, making the great action sequences even better. The dialogue is great. And, there are even some good touches of humor. The ending was also very cool. Great movie!
