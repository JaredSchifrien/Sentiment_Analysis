My Fair Lady is a wonderful musical! It is just filled with wit and charm. Audrey Hepburn was great for the role of Eliza Doolittle even though her voice was dubbed. Rex Harrison is awesome as Professor Higgins too! You can't really tell that Audrey's voice is dubbed anyway. The ending is a little annoying because it seems that Eliza is being weak to return to Higgins. I think that she loves him though and just wants things to be resolved between him and her. There is nothing wrong with that. I always end up feeling that they will get together after they discuss things a little more though. After all My Fair lady is different from Pygmalion:)
