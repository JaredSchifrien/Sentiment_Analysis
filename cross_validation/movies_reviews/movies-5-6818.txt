This movie is absolutely the funniest of all-time. The classic moments never end. Instead of playing by the rules, The Python lot always seem to go in an all out rebellion against common sense. How many people could ever have concieved a political discussion in a movie about knights. The comic devices used in this film continue to be unrivaled by all but The Life of Brian. It is clear from this film that the Pythons were the true comedic masters of their time.
