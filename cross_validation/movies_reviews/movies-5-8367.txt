 Big is a delightful comedy! Tom Hanks is actually believable as a boy transformed into an adult. The scene where Tom Hanks applies for a job is absolutely hilarious. I also love it when he arrives at the office party wearing an outrageous tuxedo and when he takes Elizabeth Perkins back to his apartment for a sleepover in his bunk beds.
