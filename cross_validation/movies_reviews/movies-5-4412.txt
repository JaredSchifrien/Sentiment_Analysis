Shrek 2 is a great movie. It's one of those rare gems that kids and adults will get a kick out of. Like the first one, it pokes satire at everything with rapier-like wit. The computer animation has also imporved since the first. Sometimes, I thought they were cutting into real world footage for some of the shots. Disney really hasn't made anything in years that matches the humor and cleverness of the Shreks. Shrek is even strong enough to withstand the Eddie Murphy curse. The only knock I have on Shrek 2 is that it is not quite the equal of the first one. But other than Godfather 2, what movie sequel is? It will win best animated feature at the Oscars.
