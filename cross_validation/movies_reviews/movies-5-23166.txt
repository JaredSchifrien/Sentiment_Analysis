It's a kind of ma-gic! Absolutely fab. Highlander was one of the only real quality fantasies I've ever seen. With a fantastic soundtrack written by Queen (aka A Kind of Magic ) and a well-thought plot, I enjoyed the film from beginning to end. I recommend it to everyone, and no, it's not just because of the soundtrack. Although the songs One Year of Love and Hammer to Fall are two of my favorites. The story of an immortal Scotsman, complete with a few cool special effects, gets a five-star automatic. Take care, everyone!
