An important movie. Wrestlers have Vision Quest, boxers have Rocky, Nascar drivers have that bad Tom Cruise movie (Days of Thunder????) - clearly it's important that high school basketball teams have an inspirational movie to get them fired up for that big game. And this movie does the trick. Gene Hackman does a great job as the coach of the Hickory Huskers, and Dennis Hopper does a nice job as the drunk, but knowledgable basketball junkie. One of those movies that it's almost impossible not to like.
