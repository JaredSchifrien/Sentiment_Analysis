Being a movie fan ,and brought up watching the old epics on the big screen,I never thought I'd ever see them bettered.That is until Braveheart.The word masterpiece is used a little to loosely these days(Forrest Gump?!!),however this film must qualify.Mel Gibson is a natural director who knows what he is doing.(Roland Emmerich please take note!).Also great to see Patrick McGoohan in a worthy role.Yes, I liked Gladiator too,but I have to agree with Wiggum on this one,it doesn't hold a candle to Braveheart.
