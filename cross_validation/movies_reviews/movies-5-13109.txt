This is the greatest movie I have seen. No other movie has depicted, with such power, how one man changed so many lives around him. I'm not exactly fond of movies with violence or profanity, but I feel that this is a rare exception . The direction of Schindler's List is superb. I couldn't believe how a movie that starts with such disturbing scenes and ideas could end on such a strong positive side. I had forgotten all about the violence inflicted on the prisoners, and, instead, I contemplated the strong example shown by Oskar Schindler in this fantastic true story. I recommend this movie to everyone mature enough to handle the extreme elements, and to see it again when you have forgotten the valor and courage shown by Schindler in this film.
