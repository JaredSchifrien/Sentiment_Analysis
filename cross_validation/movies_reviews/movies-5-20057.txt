Okay, this is a definite Love it or Hate it movie. There seems to be no grey area when asking people about it. Me? I loved it. It was the scariest movie I have ever seen. Perhaps because I didn't question it, I just let myself be taken on a ride. The ending packs a punch few other movies can come close to delivering. Plus you can't argue with the fact that it is the biggest moneymaker (percentage-wise) in movie history. Cost: 100 Grand, Made: 100 Million. Made a lot of people rich... This was one of the first DVD's I bought for my player after I got it. I've seen it five times (the DVD's director's commentary is great!) and the scary parts still make my skin crawl. Great movie, but you have to just go with it.
