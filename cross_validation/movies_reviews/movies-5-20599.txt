The best musical ever made (movie-wise)! The modern Romeo and Juliet, the two that were forbidden to love and did. Their love brought together two communities that hated each other and taught the message of tolerance and compassion. The main key between the romance of Maria and Tong said that love conquered all! The classic music that moves the story along makes the movie entertaining and a true piece of art.
