Wow! I watched this movie because I was curious to see if it's actually as terrible as everyone says. And sure enough, it's shockingly bad. I'm not sure which aspect of Battlefield Earth stunk the most - the inane plot, the overdone acting, the ridiculous makeup/costumes, or the pathetic attempts to create drama by showing slow-motion shots of glass breaking every two minutes. How did three otherwise respected actors (Travolta, Forest Whitaker, and Barry Pepper - who was great in Saving Private Ryan ) get themselves involved in such a worthless waste of time and money?
