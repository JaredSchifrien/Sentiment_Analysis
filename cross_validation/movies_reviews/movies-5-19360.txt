Hip, Funny, and SCARY sequel to the first. Believable performances, good soundtrack, and great direction ideas make this a worth while film. Starts out with a BANG (killing Jada Pinkett-Smith was hillarious...she did a really good job), and IS all the way through. Another great ScArY scene was with Sarah Michelle Gellar (she always seems to make the best out of her pretty blonde girl with a large boosum roles) running through her deserted serority house, only to be thrown off the roof...damn!
