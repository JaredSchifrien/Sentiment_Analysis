Astonishing movie, from the virtuostic direction and film editing to the brilliant ensemble cast. My only (minor) complaints are about the soundtrack. First off, it is a little too relentless. The pop songs are NONSTOP. Secondly, for most of the movie, the music parallels the setting, but towards the end, the music and the era that is being depicted are a mismatch. Still, a brilliant movie from Scorcese, as good as Taxi Driver, maybe better.
