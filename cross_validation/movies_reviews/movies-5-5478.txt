Stark, stirring, and poignantly acted by a great cast featuring Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell in the lead roles as Tom and Ma Joad. Each of the supporting characters provide capable backing in a story that is heavy in it's somber mood as retold through director John Ford's interpretation of the Steinbeck classic. The characters are best captured through the expressions on their beleagured faces and director Ford's use of soundtrack and imagery. Fonda's sad, but determined farewll speech to Ma Joad near the end of the film and Ma's resolve upon it's climax provide two of the more memorable moments in film and are both rendered masterfully by these two fine actors.
