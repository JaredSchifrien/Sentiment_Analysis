Very well done movie. Dustin Hoffman is a dad who is very busy with his career he is thrown a curveball when his wife leaves to find herself and is left to take care of his six year old son Billy. What i love about this movie is the dad has to change his priorities and make Billy the most important, All the actors are good. After about 18 months mom comes back and wants to have Billy back there is a bitter custody battle. The very ending is a tearjerker that shows what sacrifice and love is for a child.
