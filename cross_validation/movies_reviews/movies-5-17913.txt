If a horror movie is able install within you an errie persence and surprise you throughout the picture, it has accomplished its main purpose. The Exorcist is the prime example of what a GOOD horror movie should be. It also helps that the picutre has a reasonable, or dare I say, good plot and brilliant acting (which is also emcompassed inside the exorcist). The film is mesmorizing all the way through. Only few can hold a candle to this great movie classic.
