An excellent drama about the notorious female serial killer Aileen Wuonos. Charlize Theron did an excellent jon as the evil female serial killer and Christina Ricci did another excellent job as Wuonos's lesbian lover. Wuonos killed seven men in Florida in 1990 and she rightfully got the death penalty. She was executed in 2002.
