As an Army vet, it's hard to laugh when each scenario gets more preposterous than the one before. Two beautiful permanent-party MPs are NOT going to bonk a couple ugly boots in the Commanding Officer's home, the entire platoon would have at best gone to the stockade for that graduation debacle, nobody, much less an entire unit, goes straight from basic to escorting a secret weapon in Europe and they certainly don't take their MP babes with them AND THEY DON'T START WWIII. Penn & Teller should do an episode of B***S***! on this movie. I know It's only a movie, but this one's not even remotely accurate. Sergeant Bilko, (TV or movie), for its ridiculous premise, was closer to the real thing.
