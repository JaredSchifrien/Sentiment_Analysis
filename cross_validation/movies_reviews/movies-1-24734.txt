I loath this film. What a waste of the talented Miss Angelina Jolie and production costs. They could have made twelve films the size of Girl, Interrupted with that budget. There is no plot. There is no entertaining action sequences. There are no interesting characters. There are no interesting back stories. There are parts where they tried to add in comic relief but it came off as dull pointless chatter. Most of the dialouge in this film was so mind numbing all I could hear were clicking sounds. Angelina Jolie is still one very attractive woman and this film proves it once again, yes, I would like to get hot and heavy with this vixen. Beyond that this film has nothing. Absolutly nothing. It is a summer movie. But those are usually entertaining! I have never been so bored in an action film in my entire friggin life! There is a funny part though. In the beginning there is a shower scene with Lara Croft (Which shows more skin than the usual PG-13 fair) and later on is a part where we think we are about to be treated to another Lara Croft shower scene, when all of a sudden it pans down to reveal...A MAN!!! Only laugh out loud part of the movie. All the guys were like OH yea!!! Then the camera pans down to reveal a square chin covered in stubble and a receeeding hair line AHHH SH*T, MAN! Great moment. I wonder if the film makers did this intentionally?
