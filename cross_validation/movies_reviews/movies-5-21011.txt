Excellent film adaption of Loretta Lynn's autobiography. Sissy Spacek does an incredible job starring as Loretta, and even does her own singing. She certainly deserved the Oscar for her work. The entire cast is great though. It's just amazing to see how far Loretta came to make her dreams come true.
