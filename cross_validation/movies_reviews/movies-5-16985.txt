I went to go see this with a very good friend of mine and we both loved it. Unfortunately we missed the very beginning of it - but with what we saw, we loved the simplicity of the plot since it was just the four main characters. The film is very simplistic and there are no huge surprises. its quite realistic in terms of emotion - not in terms of what happens in real life. It certainly struck a chord in me. Its a very good little, simple striking film.
