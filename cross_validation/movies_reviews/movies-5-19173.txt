This movie is the most entertaining thing I've ever seen. If anything it gets better. Besides the obvious hilariousness of the film it has a bit of a spook factor. What if a legion of unstoppable zombies were to attack your town. The ending of this movie is so perfect, too. I recommend watching this movie with a big tasty donut. What happened? Why is it #6?! I guess some people just don't see the genious in the dialouge and everyhting. Oh well.
