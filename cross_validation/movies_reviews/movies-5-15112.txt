quite possibly one of my favorite movies of all time. all the elements are there: first rate acting from the whole cast, great storyline adapted from an amazing novel, michael douglas at his humble best, and if you can believe it--and honest portrayal or modesty, redemption, lost talent, rivalry, and above all else--an honest portrayal of the heart it takes to be a writer.
