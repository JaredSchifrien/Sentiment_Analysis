The feel-good comedy of the Christmas season!!! The Michelle Williams character to the Heath Ledger character : " I knew you two were up to something on your fishing trips when you didn't bring home any TROUT..... " You said a mouthful, honey. But beware... lots of man-cuddle action. Kind of like Mid-night Mass for the Gay community, no jokes allowed.... ever so serious & we must be ever so reverent & not joke about like sounding titles of a humourous nature..... boom-boom mountain, smelly tent mountain, nervous sheep mountain, KY mountain bloody stool mountain etc etc etc ad infinitum.... amen. We kid around because we love. Actually unlike any movie any of us have ever seen...... worth 9 bucks, I suppose.
