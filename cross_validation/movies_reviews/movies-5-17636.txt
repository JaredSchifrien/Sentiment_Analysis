I truly believe that this is THE greatest giant monster movie ever made, second only to KING KONG. However, upon close comparison between this (the Japanese version) and KING KONG, it becomes quite obvious that both are completely different kind of films. KING KONG is, in traditional Hollywood fashion, shot as an entertainment piece, while GODZILLA, under close scrutiny is a testimony. A testimony made by the Japanese, the only people who have a right to depict the horrible devastation of nuclear disaster. It is that fact alone that fascinates us. It is that fact, as well as the endurability of the character that we all love. But of course, we must not forget the efforts given by the films master dream-weavers. Tomuyuki Tanaka provided the concept while Ishiro Honda, arguably the greatest director of science fiction and fantasy makes radiation visible. Eiji Tsuburaya's effects are excellent for their time although they do hold up quite well today. Akira Ifukube's score is entirely evocative of the horrors of war and the devastation it causes. And there is Godzilla, one of the most recognizable movie characters of all-time. He emerges as a symbol of Japan's most inner-fears, while at the same time is a very versatile character that has become a pop-artifact. I love this movie and would place it without hesitation among the greatest of all motion pictures.
