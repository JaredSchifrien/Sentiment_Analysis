This movie has everything you could want from a movie. Drama; comedy; fight-scenes; even a little romance. This movie is long but to me it serves a purpose. This movie is a good introduction to medieval Japan. It reveals the interrelationship between two different social classes, the farmers, and the samurai. The different samurai are fascinating to me, and I wouldn't have minded if their characters wear explored a bit more. I want to know more about the silent masterswordsman samurai Kyuzo, but oh well. This is an excellent story and it's told in a way that makes it enjoyable to watch again and again. There can only be one best movie of all time. Why not this movie?
