This was the funniest movie ever made. It more than accomplished what it set out to do - incorporate a plot element from every teen movie ever made, embellish it, and then spoof it. Even the voices in the background and the signs on the walls have jokes. The guy with the slow clap, the guy's sister coming on to him, and the main character's prize-winning paintings turning out to be drawings that a preschooler would draw. Too much!
