This movie is exactly what it wanted to be and should have been. Violent, funny and prophetic. The commercials intercut with the action are classics themselves. With the recent reign of survivor and temptation-type shows I cannot help thinking about dobermans attacking rope-climbers or I'll buy THAT for a dollar! Director Verhoeven is probably the only one who could film John Brunner's Stand on Zanzibar and get away with it.
