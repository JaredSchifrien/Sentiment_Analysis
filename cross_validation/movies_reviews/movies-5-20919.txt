Really wonderful film! It's so visually stunning to watch, full of vibrant, colourful costumes and scenery. On top of that the music is fun and addictive, mostly adapted from famous pop songs, used in new and inventive ways. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are perfect together, and I was really surprised at how well they performed vocally!
