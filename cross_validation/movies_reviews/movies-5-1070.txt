This movie is terrific! I love the dark humor and nuances. The characters are unique, quirky and so memorable. Frances McDormand is fantastic as the pregant sheriff, one of the most unique film characterizations in recent years. This movie turned me on to the Coen brothers, and while I've enjoyed most of their other films, this is their supreme achievement.
