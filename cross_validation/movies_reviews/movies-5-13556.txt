If any film could be a fine wine, American Beauty is it. Compelling with strong leads, leaving the viewer with a genuine empathy for each character. It's beautifully filmed and very touching. I am in love, and it is with this film. If you miss this film you may miss one of the last masterpiece's in modern cinema.
