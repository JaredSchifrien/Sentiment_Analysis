Too long, went with 3 teenagers so they were bored to tears but there are some scenes that are simply amazing to behold the story is weak predictable but getting DDL to play a yank and LDC to play Irish is a risk but it works CD is the weak link. Love the scenes in the Chinese club! U2 song overrated
