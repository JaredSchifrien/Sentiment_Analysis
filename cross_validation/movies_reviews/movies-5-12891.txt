A movie with a miracle. This is a make-you-feel good movie. This movie will give in courage in life. It tells you that miracles do happen, but it's not something that we get just by sitting there and wanting it to come. You have to work hard and always believe in the things that you're doing. I mean after all, a miracle is not some magical thing, it's just our will and desire to thrive hard to get where we want go, and if you never give up, you'll eventually get there.
