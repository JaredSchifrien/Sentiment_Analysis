The constant flashbacks were annoying and unclear. I mean, after jumping back and forth through time I find myself putting the pieces together since it seemed as though all of the scenes were just slapped together. The ending was predictable after realizing that only Katie Holmes sees the bad guy. After watching this movie from beginning to end I wished that Katie Holmes had hit ME over the head with a rock and left me for dead.
