Despite the sometimes slow-moving pace of the film, I really thought that this was one hell of a thriller. It was not really scary, just very suspenseful and thrilling. I thought that the musical score was perfect for the film, and just made it all the more suspenseful. Yes, some parts in the middle dragged on, but in the end, it was well worth the wait. It became predictable in the last 45 minutes of the film, but I never expected quite the ending that this film provided. I have never watched a scene in recent times quite like the love scene when Pfeiffer's character discovers that her husband (Ford) was cheating on her with a student. Fine acting jobs by both Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford, espescially Ford, who truly showed his range as an actor, playing a vey different role than the good guy roles that he is accustomed to. He truly showed darkness both through his facial expressions and words at the end of the movie- his character just turned stone cold at the end: no emotion. This film had it all: suspense, a great plot, great acting, a great musical score and an eerie feeling that reminded me so much of Psycho . I'd reccomend it to anyone who is looking for a film that even remotely resembles the work of Hitchcock.
