Raising Arizona (released in 1987) is the Coen Brothers' sophomore film and is considered by many to be their best. The movie starts with an extended, philosophically tinged monologue by smalltime criminal H.I. Hi McDonnough (Nicolas Cage) on how he meet his ex-cop wife Ed (Holly Hunter) and their struggles to have baby. The couple read about how the wife of local business bigwig Nathan Arizona, Sr. (Trey Wilson) has just had quintuplets so they decide that they should get a share of the bounty and kidnap one of the infants. Arizona hires a rough, no questions asked bounty hunter Leonard Smalls (Randall Tex Cobb) to track down the missing baby while Hi's neighbors (Sam McMurray and Frances McDormand) and hoodlum friends (John Goodman and William Forsythe) get suspicious and want the baby for themselves. After evading all the traps and snares set by all the antagonists, including a hair raising chase with a stolen box of Huggies, our heroes ultimately decide that honesty is the best policy. While I am not a fan of Nicolas Cage, he along with Goodman and Cobb made this film especially with the eccentric musings of Cage's character as the film progresses. The bottom line is that Raising Arizona is a great, eccentric comedy that is very cerebral notwithstanding much of the physical humor.
