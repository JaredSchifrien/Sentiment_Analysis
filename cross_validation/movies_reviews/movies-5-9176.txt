This movie is hilarious. I just rented it last night, and it exceeded my very high expectations. How often do you see this combination of a truly original idea, great acting, and great directing? I definitely give points to John Malkovich the actor for agreeing to do this unusual movie. That trip through his subconscious was one of my favorite parts, and it takes an actor with a great sense of humor to go along with it. And even Charlie Sheen gets points for mocking himself in his brief appearances as Malkovich s friend. John Cusak has started getting on my nerves recently, but he does a great job, too, as the tormented puppeteer who suffers from unrequited love. But be warned - this movie isn t for everyone. If you re looking for a standard, by-the-numbers action, comedy, or drama, look somewhere else. But if you re in the mood for something different and strange, this is a great rental. Being John Malkovich is quirky, twisted, and very entertaining.
