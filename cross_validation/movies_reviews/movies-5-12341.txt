Wallace and Gromit are, without a doubt, the two most charming, lovable, heart-warming and sweet-natured characters to ever grace both television and the silver screen. "The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" is outrageously funny and quite simply, hilarious without being insulting. Nick Park is a genius; this movie is a labor of love and the best one I have ever seen. W&G are not just for kids. Some of the adults who are head over heels in love with this dynamic duo are the most worldly, sophisticated, accomplished and even cynical people I know. Wallace's big, goofy grin and Gromit's deep, soul eyes have captured hearts from all age groups and all walks of life. I'd give it six stars it they were available! :)
