The best movie I have seen since Braveheart !!! This one should take home all awards possible. A must see! One of the BEST movies I have ever seen. No regrets that it is 3 hours long, NONE! This will be a classic. As a huge Steven King fan I was pleased to see that The Green Mile tops all of his other movies (with out comparing to The Shinning - wouldn't know how to compare those two). ******************************
