This movie sucked! It was written and directed by very sick minds. I hope children don't watch this movie. I can't imagine anyone wanting to see such a sick movie. Everyone who saw it at the theatre agreed that it sucked and should never have been made. The director should stick to fashion designing for himself. The writer should be seeking professional help and not be allowed to share such dementia with the world.
