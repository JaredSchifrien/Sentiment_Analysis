 Tuna and I agree that you should avoid this movie at all cost!!! The dramatic moment was the execution and suicide. However the Halle/Billy Bob plot wasn't exciting. They break up. They kiss. Blah Blah. I also love the writers for killing off the kid so his mother can have more sex with the old man.(sarcasm).
