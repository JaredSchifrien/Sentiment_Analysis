This movie doesn't have any famous actors aside from Billy Crystal and Fred Savage (whose parts are very small) but it's great. It's a wonderful story, and while it may seem cheesy (1987 special effects really aren't that good) to today's viewers, it's still a good story. I grew up with this movie and loved it, and many people I know still love this movie.
