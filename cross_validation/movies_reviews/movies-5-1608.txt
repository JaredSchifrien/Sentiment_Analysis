This was one hell of a movie. A word of advice, if you decide to watch this, don't eat dinner while you are watching it. There are a lot of graphic scenes in this film, but that just adds to the creepiness of the film. The plot is very, very provocative and disturbing, and I thought that Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman had a unique chemistry together. Pitt was definately at his best in this film. And Kevin Spacey was wonderful in his short appearance towards the end of the film. This film never lost my interest in its 2+ hours, and is definately one of the best thrillers out there, and definately the best psycological thriller since Silence of the Lambs .
