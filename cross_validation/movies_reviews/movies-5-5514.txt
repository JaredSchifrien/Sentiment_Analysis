This movie was excellent - I saw it when I was very young, but this movie is a must-see whenever it's on in reruns. There are 2 classic scenes: the shower scene and the scene where the car slowly sinks to the bottom of the lake. Both have been copied more times than I can count. Hitchcock's masterpiece, in my opinion. It was way ahead of its time, which makes it modern. The psychological, sexual, and violent aspects were a first in movie history. The forerunner to the slasher film.
