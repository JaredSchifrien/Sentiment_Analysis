9 to 5 is definatly one of the funniest movies ever made, and may be called classic one day. It never stops delivering laughs and it's fast-paced and exciting. Judy, Violet, And Dorlee are 3 secretaries to a sexiest, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot boss, Mr. Hart. 9 to 5 was the perfect movie, and Colin Higgins, the director recieves full credit.
