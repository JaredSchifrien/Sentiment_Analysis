Extremely terrible movie is what describes 'Soul Plane'. It was not only because of the lack of a real plot, nor was it the fact that the cast could not act if their lives depended on it; it was the fact that the movie was plain DUMB. It was not funny, whatsoever. And everyone ought to be insulted by this horrific piece of trash as it plays to the worst possible stereotypes often attributed to minorities, especially African Americans. This was an embarrassment to all of moviedom. Period.
