I never get tired of this movie. A great story, good acting, and some unbelievable action - the train wreck is especially compelling. There is something riveting about stories which deal with the wrongfully accused - and the Fugitive is mesmerizing throughout. Probably my favorite Harrison Ford movie, and Tommy Lee Jones is superb as well. Also, you have to love the Simpsons episode which begins with Bart writing on the blackboard I will not tell people my homework was stolen by a one-armed man.
