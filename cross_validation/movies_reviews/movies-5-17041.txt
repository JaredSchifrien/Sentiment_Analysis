My partner and I are huge fans of Kevin Spacey and decided to rent this out one night - and I'm really happy that we did. An interesting take on capital punishment and the little tasters and twists that are dished out throughout the film are brilliant. Full of suspense and brilliant acting by Kevin Spacey and Kate Winslet.
