Run Lola Run is fun to watch but you should do so with a rewind button ready - several clips are flashes of scenes in a row that go so fast you are meant only to get the gist of the events. The fantasy is original and the film techniques mostly support the overall mood. I didn't especially like the cartoon sequences interspersed (about 3 total) in the movie, but they weren't horrible.
