Excellent movie. Everyone in America should see it. It spoke of the power created from a united effort, as one , and enjoying and making the best of the differences in people- not discounting them just because of color, religion, etc. It also showed how people can change, even the most die-hard rednecks of all colors can get beyond their prejudices, once they actually get to know a person. It was a powerful movie, full of hope! I think it should be shown at highschools and churches, as well as the theatres.
