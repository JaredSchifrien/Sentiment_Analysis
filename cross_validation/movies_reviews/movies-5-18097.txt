Misery is about a nurse who has craziness and selfishness. The scary part of this movie is the story and how the camera focusses on the nurse's mind-illness and shows her hidden craziness caused by her selfishness. This movie is well-done since the story not only scares the audience by showing her brutal characteristics, but also also let the audience think about how a nurse could be crazy, or about her psychological problems.
