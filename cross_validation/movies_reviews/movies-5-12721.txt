To be honest, the facts that were raised does not surprise me at all considering some of the comments I have read about gun control on this very website..... I thought the film was very well presented and definately thought provoking. To BIGBABY, yes Michael Moore is making money out of things like this, but the fact that he is bringing attention to subjects like this should mean that your government should sort it out and pump money where its needed. Why should Michael Moore? He didn't create this awful situation.
