By far, one of the best animated movies ever made. The characters are warm, loveable, and memorable. The story is heart-warming. Has a lot of cute, slapstick-type comedy to make it enjoyable for young children. But it is deep enough to touch an adult's heart. I was in my very early teens when I first saw it. Now, at the age of 20, it's just as close to my heart as it was then.
