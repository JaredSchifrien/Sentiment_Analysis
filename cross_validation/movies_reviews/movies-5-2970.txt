Anthony Hopkins is as brilliant as ever. Very nerve-wrecking and scary. Some people want more action it it, but I thought the action level was just fine. There wasn't any need for any more. I think a movie should only have meaningful action. I digress... The movie was great, and it could have been a tad better, but it's just fine the way it is. I, myself, thought it was a VERY good movie, and I think everyone should atleast TRY to be an optimist instead of a pessimist when rating the movie.
