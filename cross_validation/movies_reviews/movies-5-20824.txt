Really a 4.5. Our family went today. I really enjoyed this movie. It was well done imaginative, and well acted. I like musicals anyway and it was nice to see one on the big screen. All the actors did a good job with their roles. and considering some had never danced before, did a fine job with the dance numbers. A found this movie to be a nice treat.
