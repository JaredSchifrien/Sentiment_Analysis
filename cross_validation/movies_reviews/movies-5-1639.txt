I have to admit...when I first saw the ads for this movie I was highly pesimistic. Now after seeing it, how wrong I was to judge!! (obviously if you don't mind reading sub text at the bottom of your television screen than you should be alright watching this movie.) I found myself crying at the end. Beautifully crafted and amazing fighting scenes, I could hardly move I was so enthralled. Seriously.
