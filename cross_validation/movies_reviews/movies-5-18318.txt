Certainly the best of them all, although i really liked a new nightmare. I have never forgot Freddy and I think he is one of the best horror heroes! No one parties like Freddy! I still remember the tv series they put out. Great film and I love the part where Nancy sees the dead girl in the body bag outside the class room door!
