This is a terrible film. Direction is inept, everyone looks as though they are going through the motions. Cameron Diaz is the shining light that burns bright in this foul stench of a film. DONNOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS FILM. Unless you like your films with inpenetrable dialogue, risible directing and poor editing. What was Bill Murray thinking??????
