The best comic adaptation ever! It's just like reading the comics from beginning to end. Stan Lee really made sure this film would be a mirror image of the comic storyline. It portrayed the Green Goblin saga perfectly (especially the ending). Great acting (even by the portayed newcomer Toby McGwire). Very realistic as well. The movie shows Peter Parker having to learn and perfect his superpowers instead of just knowing them in an instant. He also moves very gracefully as well (as he should). I only have one complaint. Originally in the comic series, Spider Man's webs were shot out through special machines Parker created instead from his wrist. A solid film all the way through. That's the reason why the film is sold out at every theater.
