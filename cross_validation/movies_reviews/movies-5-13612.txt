Fantastic acting, character sketches, story idea, and plot development. Spacey is beyond excellence in his portrayal of a lust-struck man in midlife, and all the other characters are almost as vibrant in their depiction and almost as well casted. The way it's told, after his death, is intriguing and it works well in this case. This is a masterpiece that will be known 200 years from now as great literature, the way we know Lady Chatterly's Lover today.
