January 15, 2004. I saw the first trailer for the Dawn of the Dead remake. I asked my father about. He said, Yeah. It's an old zombie movie made in the 70s. Later, I figured out that it was The greatest zombie movie ever. March 14, 2004, I saw it. It was the stupidest thing I had ever seen(and i've seen House of the Dead). Terrible acting. Unrealistic zombies. No action. Pointless. No where near as good as the remake. This movie sucked. Almost all of Romero's movies suck. Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, and a couple of non-zombie movies he did. They all sucked. Do not watch this movie.
