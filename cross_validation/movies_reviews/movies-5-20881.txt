I really enjoyed this movie. Having been boring in the 1980s, I of course, wasn't alive in the times of Richie Valens, but I enjoy seeing a film which traced his roots. Lou Diamond Phillips did a great job at bringing Richie back to life, and the rest of the cast did a great job as well. A lot of great music! It's so sad that Richie's life was cut so tragically short.
