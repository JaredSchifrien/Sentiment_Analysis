For those who didn't follow the movie trilogy... It's hard to make a movie about Christ (THE Anointed ONE) and explain the human/spiritual condition of the world without getting ridiculed. NEO is a play on words. If you switch the letters around, it's ONE. Thus, once Mr. Anderson became fully enlightened, he only referred to himself as NEO (The ONE). If you don't get the reference to Jesus, right there, it's because it's a reference to Buddah (THE Enlightened ONE). They linked these 2 together as the same person for a reason. That's why the trilogy is flooded with quotes from Buddah and the Bible. In Reloaded, before NEO met Seriph (who is an angel, by the way), there were 2 shrines shown. One for Jesus and one for Buddah. I can point so many things out, like NEO becoming ONE with TRINITY after his arrival in ZION. The metaphors go on and on. The Watchowski Brothers were very slick with the writing and direction of this trilogy. I call this trilogy, Excellent.
