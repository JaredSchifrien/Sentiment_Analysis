Being a Southerner, I was truly hoping that Gods and Generals would be a good movie. Believe me -- I read the numerous negative reviews, but I decided to see the movie myself because I concluded that Yankees who did not appreciate Southern History wrote the reviews. However, seeing the movie was a huge mistake! I am not exaggerating when I say that Gods and Generals is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. Anyone that tells you that this movie is great is in complete denial. The movie, at best, serves as a how to video for Civil War Re-enactors -- nothing more. Sitting through four boring and tedious hours of this movie was complete torture. Again, Southerners are depicted as arrogant far right wing extremist and religious zealots. With respect to Gods and Generals, do yourself a favor--STAY AT HOME!
