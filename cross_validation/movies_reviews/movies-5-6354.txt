One of the best movies ever made. And it hasn't lost much with age (much like Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson). If anything, the story of alienation in modern society is more relevant now than it was back then. My favorite scene is when Dustin Hoffman and Katherine Ross are connecting for the first time - they close the top of the convertable and that shuts us, as viewers, out of their conversation, so we only hear the random noises around them as they talk in the car.
