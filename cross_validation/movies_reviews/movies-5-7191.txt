The King of Comedies. My #2 favorite movie of all time (next to Rocky). Though primarily lowbrow, anyone who went to college can relate to this movie (I was not a Greek, either). If I had to rank my favorite scenes, it would go: #1 Mind if we Dance With Yo Dates; #2 Marmarlade -- Raped in Prison -- Niedermeyer -- shot by his own troops in Vietnam; #3 Bluto's inspirational speech to the Deltas (Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor); #4 Double Secret Probation; #5 I'm a zit; #6 Bluto smashing the guitar; #7 The Devil/Angel scene; #8 The parade; #9 The reaction of the Deltas when they see Dorfman for the first time; #10 The expulsion scene with Dean Wormer. I can watch Animal House over and over and still laugh at the same scenes. I freakin' actually had an incident similar to the Fawn Leibowitz scene. I pity the young dude who is a quite prolific rater here and gave it 1 star. All I can say to you dude is that you need to start drinking heavily.
