This movie was something of a surprise to me.most french films that i had seen until now were boring as hell!! but this one is the opposite. Amelie is a breath of fresh air that makes you feel amazinlgy good - i left the theather in such a good mood has it had not happened in a long time. wonderful film,very well directed, with an amazing cast - audrey tatou is fabulous, and a soundtrack that cannot be described - you have to listen to the cd!!
