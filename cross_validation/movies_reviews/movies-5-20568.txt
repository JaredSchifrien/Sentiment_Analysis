This is one of the great feel good movies of all time. Gene Kelly's dance number, singing and dancing in the rain, is a classic and one of his best. The Good Morning sequence with Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds is contagious -- after I've watched the movie, that song sticks in my mind for days!
