Samuel Jackson was awesome, but this was the most anti-arab movie(along with Delta Force). Why pick yemen as bad guys. They haven't done anything serious(prior to Cole). They never said what was the problem in Yemen; They just assumed that there was always trouble in the mid east. Why show the arab civilians as barbarians that love to kill people(kids and women). Besides the ending was so predictable. The verdict could have been guilty or somebody die. They also show The US government as hypocrites. They can kill 80 civilians because of 3 navy men. Do not rent this movie, unless you like to see racism as a good thing.
