I can't say it any better than Shroowoman, read the book. I read the book, and the film is totally inaccurate. First off, it is not a gun company that was sued in the book, it was a tobacco company. In the film, only one juror is kicked off. In the book, three jurors are kicked off. After being approached about her abortion, Rikki Coleman attempts suicide in the film; they never even approach her in the book. And Rankin Fitch NEVER meets Nicholas Easter in the book. If wou want to see a good movie about a jury, see '12 Angry Men'. Trust me, it is tons better.
