This is the story of Ruth Etting, the 1920's torch singer, and her abusive relationship with her husband, a gangster. James Cagney earned a Best Actor oscar nomination for this role. Doris Day is just wonderful in the part. She sings, dances and emotes with excellent results. She surprised her fans and critics with her, heretofore, untapped talent. This movie was a big hit at the time of its release, and the soundtrack was the No.1 bestselling album. If you can, listen to Ruth Etting sing. She has an extraordinary delivery.
