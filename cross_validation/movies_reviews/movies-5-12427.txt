DaVinci Code Lite (In fact, did you catch Dr. Gates' alias was Brown). But it was very entertaining and it was an outstanding family film in that my kids learned something by watching it. The on-location scenes, particularly in Philadelphia (Hey look kids, I remember that was the place me and Louie Tunutos got a cheesesteak in 1979), were great. I give it 2 thumbs, 2 big toes and a penis (the cute blonde curator) up.
