This movie kicked ass! The whole time I was on the edge of my seat. The story was awesome. The writer had a good flow and the concept was perfectly horrific. I love the whole idea of cheating death and the resulting (New) future in which the characters are chased by death in the order they were seated in the plane. If you have never seen this movie, it is definitely worth your time!!!!
