WHAT A PIECE OF GARBAGE!!! I never thought I could hate a movie with Liam Neeson, Lili Taylor or Catherine Zeta-Jones, but I CAN! This just sucked! I thought House on Haunted Hill (based on the same book as this) was WAAAAAAYYYYY better. Hell, The Others was way better than this piece of crap. I was actually hoping they'd all get killed in the end.
