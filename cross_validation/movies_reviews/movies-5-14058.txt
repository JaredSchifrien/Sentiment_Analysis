OUTSTANDING !!!! Ron Howard really did his homework on this one. The story is well written and the actual facts are as damn close to the truth as possible in hollywood. The use of actual props and NASA footage made this movie a real look into history. I think the intent was to inform you more than entertain you, and this movie did bolth. To say this movie was boring, three guys floating around in a broken tin can shows the lack of inteligence in that particular viewer. The story of Apollo 13 is true, it happened, it is an important date in areospace history and this movie portraies it well
