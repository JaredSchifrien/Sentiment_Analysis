I found this movie very entertaining. It was the best work that Christopher Columbus has done in a long while, with beautiful, sweeping cinematography(as someone mentioned before, I think), inspired casting, and great special effects. Having never read the books, I'm sure I missed a lot(as one always does when they see a movie adapted from a book or something of that sort.), but I still found the movie very charming. I would recommend it highly to anyone who enjoys films of the cute and mindless persuasion. I wanna be a wizard. (Not a witch..I will transcend the unfair gender stereotypes.)
