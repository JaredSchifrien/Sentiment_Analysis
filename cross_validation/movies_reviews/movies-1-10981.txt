I can't believe I even bothered to watch this crap. Martin Lawrence? A man in drag? It was stupid, disgusting, lame, suck, dumb, so many words you could explain it with. Nothing new, whoever made this shouldn't have even made the effort.And Martin Lawrence is TERRIBLE! Unrealistic and stupid. Simply avoid. Summary: A DUMB, DISGUSTING, LAME FILM.
