what a beautiful movie. it's as fun as a movie like 'goonies' but a lot more intelligent. it's a vehicle for any kid's dreams; finding out one day you have magic powers, and getting whisked away from your humdrum life, to a world where everyone's on awe of you, and adventure and intrigue are everywhere. visually, it's perfect. the characters are totally believable, considering the unreality of their situations. i haven't read the books, but the number one complaint i hear from those who have is that too many of the details and the nuances that make rowlings such a great writer don't reach the screen, but i understand that what is there is totally faithful to the novels, and it was more than enough for me. the quidditch match has been compared to the pod race in star wars ep 1, and while i'm a die hard star wars fan, i think it's loads better. a must see.
