This movie has it all! As the wise, old storyteller says, it has everything from wash buckling, sword fighting adventure, to true love. It is a powerful story of the bond of love between a boy and a girl and their unshakable quest to protect it. The villains are humorously ludicrous and the movie's tongue-in-cheek humor will keep you interested.
