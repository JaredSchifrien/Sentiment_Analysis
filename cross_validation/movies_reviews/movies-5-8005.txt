This is one of the funniest movies ever made but it has to be seen uncut. The plot is two guys join the army thinking its their best bet for the future. They are not you typical soldiers and piss of the DI right off their military service takes some very funny twists to the point that they end up in a very well armored RV. Harold Ramis and Bill Murray are great.
