This movie will no doubt disappoint those who expect epic battle scenes and nonstop action - this is not that type of World War II movie. That fact, however, does not necessarily make it bad. What makes this movie bad is the pseudo-intellectual feel that virtually drips off the screen. I really feel that a lot of people saw this movie and despite its awfulness, believe that saying they like it is the sign of an intellectual. This movie desperately tries to be poetic and filled with meaning, but what results is dull, contrived, and utterly void of spirit.
