This is by far one of the best movies I've ever seen. Being an avid rabbit lover and owner it reminded me of my bunnies so much. Its just overall cute and funny. I loved it so much I saw it twice just to take in all the things I may have missed. I just can't belive that clay-mation could be so precise and entertaining. Bravo to the makers of this funny and amazing movie. And it isn't just for kids, alot of adult humor in it also.
