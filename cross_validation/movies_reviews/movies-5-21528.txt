I just got back from seeing this. IT WAS AWESOME!!!! I really wasn't crazy about Phantom Menace and Attack Of The Clones was so-so. I was worried that this one would be lacking as well, but to my pleasant surprise it wasn't. There was a lot of great action and this movie tied together all the details from Episode 4. I can't wait to watch the original Star Wars again with a new perspective. Thanks for making this one great George!!!
