A wonderful movie. A selfish young man finds out he has an older brother after his dad dies. His brother Raymond is autistic and lives in an institution. Rayamond has inherited all the money.Charlie kidnaps his brother in hopes of getting his cut of the money. they go for a 2000 ride to California. Raymond turns out to have savant capabilities in memory and counting.he uses his brother to get some money in Vegas. the good side of this movie is Charlie learns that Raymond cannot change.So Charlie has to change for his brother and do what is best for him.this movie is funny, sad, and heartwarming.Dustin Hoffman did an excellent job playing RAymond the autistic man. I have a relative with autism, I feel they handeld this movie dealing with autism with fairness without making fun of those with autism.
