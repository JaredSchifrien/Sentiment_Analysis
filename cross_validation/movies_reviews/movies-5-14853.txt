Funny and moving. The only problem I saw was that there were far too many climactic moments in which they played the overly dramatic music and some important decision is made, etc. Most movies lead up to one of these, however I think Remember the Titans had about six. That didn't annoy me enough to inspire me to subtract a star, however. Denzel Washington was excellent, I thought. Plus, a good soundtrack!
