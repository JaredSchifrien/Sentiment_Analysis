My absolute favourite of the three. The spark between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery is amazing - the scenes with those two are absolutely hilarious and they do seem like father and son - and the dynamic works. You learn a bit more about Indiana Jones' past (like his real name is Junior and his dogs name was Indiana) and you get to see the more human side to him. they are aiming to get the most prized item in their field - the Holy Grail, but instead of getting it, it brings them closer and they leave the Holy Grail where it is. Fantastic!
