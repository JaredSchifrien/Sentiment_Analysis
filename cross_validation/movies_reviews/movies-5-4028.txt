Thankfully Pixar's deal with Disney is coming to an end so they can make great films without having that sickening Disney touch to it. I absolutely loved this film as did the seven guys who I watched it with did. The animation is out of this world and the characters are very funny. Do love the seagulls - 'mate, mate, mate....'
