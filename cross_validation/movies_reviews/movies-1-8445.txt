I really, really, really hate it when bad movies get a sequel and good ones don't. Austin Powers is a fool and so are the writers of this lowbrow, moronic comedy. I don't understand the appeal of this movie. The jokes are gross and what I call under-the-top, which means the situation is not played up for comedy in a clean way and resorts to the garbage can instead. Don't watch it.
