Probably my favorite movie of all time. Scorsese captures the personalities of that era/lifestyle flawlessly. Every word in the dialogue and every song on the soundtrack are so carefully hand-picked...This is one of those few movies that simply won't get old. I plain-and-simple can not watch the scene where Pesci critiques his mom's artwork without cracking up laughing. ( I love it. One dog goes one way, another dog goes the other. And the guy in the back, he's sayin' 'What you want from me?' )
