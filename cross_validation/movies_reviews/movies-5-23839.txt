Although slightly inferior to Treks 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9, this one is still good. It brings the TOS and TNG crews together, shows us the missing link in the Enterprises (the B, Excelsior-class) and the origin of Guinan. Also, TNG foes Lursa and B'etor are brought back as the enemies. With emotions from Data, saucer seperation, time travel, the TNG theme, other Starfleet ships, and cool new sets, this one has many great touches. As with all Trek movies, this one comes highly recommended.
