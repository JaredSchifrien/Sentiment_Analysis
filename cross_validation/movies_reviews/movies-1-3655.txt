One word TERRIBLE. First, I don't much care for most Snipes flicks. They tend to all be about the same, and always predictable, and he always plays the same character. There are a few that are OK, but this isn't one of them. The special effects were bad, and one could tell that the budget was all spent on Snipes because the cars that blew up were always old cars off by themselves where the shots were easy to control. Avoid this film if you can.
