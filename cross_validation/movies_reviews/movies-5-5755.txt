Second only to Vertigo as far as Hitchcock films go this film beautifly combines love and suspense. Cary Grant is at his best which adds to my frustration that he never recieved an Oscar. Ingrid Bergmann nearly trumps her Casablanca role. It's sad that you can only purchase this DVD for $40! (only offered as a Criterion collection disk). I guess I could go buy MI2 if I want to see this movie poorly done.
