John Carpenter does an excellent job of setting the mood in most of his movies. You feel like you are part of the action on the screen rather than just sitting in the audience watching a movie. If you liked this movie, check out some of his other movies, like The Thing , Escape from New York , or especially Assault on Precinct 13 . Too bad he hasn't made a decent movie in years. :(
