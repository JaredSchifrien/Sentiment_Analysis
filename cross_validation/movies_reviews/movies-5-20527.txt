This was about burning oil refineries in Kuwait/Iraq, where there were hundreds of these oil fires. I saw it in a cold theater when I watched this, and it got hotter during the movie. The fires were right there in front of me. You could see the oxygen burst, the tendrils of the flames. You could see the heat burn off. I never knew that oil fires were different from ones here in this area. They had completely different machines, and now I knew what they were. The film also showed all the damage that had been done to the countryside. You felt hatred towards the people who caused these fires unecessarily.
