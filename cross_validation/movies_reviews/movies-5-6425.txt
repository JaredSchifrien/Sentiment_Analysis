The first time I saw this movie, I laughed so hard that my ribs ached for three days. The studio insisted on the romantic subplot, but you sort of need the interludes to catch your breath. In the end, the boys' anarchy prevails. The stateroom scene must be the funniest single scene in the history of the movies.
