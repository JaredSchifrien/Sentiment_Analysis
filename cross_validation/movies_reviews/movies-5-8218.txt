This is the funniest film I have ever seen. This is the type of comedy that has you wondering whether you might have sprung a hernia. The type that brings members of your family rushing into your room to wonder about the commotion as you watch it time and again. Some films you might think are funny, and they genuinely may be, but where 'Mary' beats every other comedy, hands down, is in the amount of work, preparation, perspiration, editing, re-editing, rehersal, honing and perfecting that has gone into the script and production. All this work manifests itself on screen as pure quality and brilliant comic genius. Three scenes come to mind - the early bathroom scene, the police interrogation of Ben Stiller after he picks up the hitchhiker and the Matt Dillon dog scene. They are the cream, but there is still enough material to keep your comedic appetite honed. And guess what? There is a satisfying and gratfiying storyline too. The music is fantastic, the performances are great, the backdrops are spot-on. All-in-all it makes my British heart jealous. Have no doubts - this film is the 'real deal'.
