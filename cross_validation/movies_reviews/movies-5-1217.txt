Quinten Tarantino has a way to create a story, make it go backwards, than flip it upside-down, and make you want to rant and rave about it for the rest of your existance. Out of the few movies he has made this is my favorite. And I will strike down with great vengenance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengance apon thee. -Pulp Fiction
