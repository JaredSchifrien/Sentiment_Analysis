The Marx brothers' unique brand of anarchic humour may not be for all tastes,but for those of you,like me,who are enamoured,this spoof of war heroics and all sorts of -isms(with Groucho,would you believe,as President of Ruritania,Harpo and Chico as spies) surely has to be their most inspired and hilarious hour(and 10 minutes).The nightgown-mirror scene had me banging on the floor in convulsions.
