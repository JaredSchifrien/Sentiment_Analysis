I loved every minute of this film.It was entertaining from beginning to end. The acting was well done and the characters were hilarious and memorable. The only gripe I had with the film was that there were some stuff in the movie that was already used in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Other than that, it is a fantastic film that's worth watching again and again.
