I didn't like this film very much!!!It was TOO disgusting!!!Also the storyline was RIDICULOUS!!!But also realistic!!!This was worse than Ren and Stimpy.Here are the gross parts:Drew's character Nancy eats a raison with Lysol sprayed on it,Ms.Connelly chokes on a chocolate,and spits it out on Nancy's forehead,the scene where Ben's character Alex is fixing the sink pipe,and Nancy accidently swallows the tained water,and barfs in Alex's face,and when they get the flu and cough on popcorn in a bowl!!!DISGUSTING!!!!!
