Baz Luhrmann did a great job with keeping the script to the original play, and interpreting the content as well. The camera work and music combined with Shakespeare's words were fantastic. It has been increasingly popular to rework Shakespeare's plays in films (10 Things I Hate About You, Hamlet etc) Leo DiCaprio and Claire Danes act out the starcrossed lovers very well, there definately was an acting spark between the two. Pete Postlewhaite was outstanding as Friar Brown and the tattoo of the cross on his back was a great touch. Hollywood can be good at producing movies with merit, and this is one of them.
