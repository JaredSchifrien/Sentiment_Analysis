Gotta love it. My second favorite of the Monty Python movies (first favorite still is "The Meaning of Life". I know most would disagree with me on that one, but oh well). Can't go wrong with the limbless Black Knight, vicious little white bunnies and Holy Hand Grenades. Oh, and for the truly nerdy amongst us ( . . . oh, admit it), if you want to know the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow (of the European variety), you can find your answer here: http://www.style.org/unladenswallow/ ( . . . if you want to know what the answer is for the African variety, sorry, you're on your own.)
