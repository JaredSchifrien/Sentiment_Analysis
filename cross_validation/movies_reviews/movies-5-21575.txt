EXCELLENT MOVIE! I can't stand fantasy/sci fi movies - but Lord of the Rings is the exception. I was hounded to see it for the longest time but refused because I thought it would suck - I finally watched it to shut him up and I couldn't be happier that I did. I'm a die-hard Lord of the Rings fan now! And if you like the Fellowship - you'll love the Two Towers!
