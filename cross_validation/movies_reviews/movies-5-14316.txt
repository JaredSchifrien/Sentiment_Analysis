I was not disappointed at all in Fight Club! I went in not knowing anything about the film, and came out satisfied with the acting, the themes (underlying and apparent) as well as the twists. I think I am a rather observant person, however I was totally caught off guard with the twist of this movie. I thought it was a thought provoking and raw look into the life of this ordinary man.
