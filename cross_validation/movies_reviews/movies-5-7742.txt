This is probably the weirdest film I have ever seen, and I am a fan of Yellow Submarine , The Wall , and American Beauty . It evokes its humor and mood from such irony, that it is probably the most effective movie I've seen without gratuitous sex, violence, or language. We see what's happening, and that alone is enough to keep you on your toes. Where else but in this film would a vending machine hold the fate of humanity? And the most famous image, that of Lt. Kong riding the bomb as it falls to the ground, just ties up so much irony, it's sickening. Great film, all-around. If you haven't seen it, do so, by all means. Although the Cold War is long over, it holds great relevance today....
