This has to easily be THE BEST cartoon I have EVER seen and so far the best feature I've seen this year. Creative, engaging, unpredictable, wierd, incredible pace, funny, the list just goes on. I loved the stories moral tale of greed and love conquering all, it was told in a more respectable and dignified way than an in-your-face you must heed mawkish way. The beauty of this feature is that it's target audience was directed more at adults than children. You walk away from this movie feeling good and you completely understand why its called Spirited Away.
