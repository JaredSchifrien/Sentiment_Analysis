How can anyone not like this movie? First let me state that if this type of movie were released today I would be hesitant to see it because I'm not into musicals per se; my tastes range from witty comedies to supense to action movies. That being said, I have to acknowledge the greatness of this movie since it is ingrained into my (and everyone's) memory, and I always enjoy seeing it. I just wish it were presented on television as an event once a year like in the old days (it was shown on or around Easter time on NBC when I was a kid), not 30 times a day on TBS or TNT on July 4th. Anyway, if you have not seen it there is something wrong with you.
