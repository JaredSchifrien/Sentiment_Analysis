What a great change of pace from all the so-called realistic message movies where the goal of the filmmakers seems to be geared more toward political persuasion than entertainment. Bridget Jones Diary definitely qualifies as the later and, as an added bonus, even throws in a little bouquet of hopefulness for you to take home. You remember the kind of film I m talking about; the kind where you leave the theater discussing all the great lines and funny parts and don t feel you had to be dragged through a gutter or insane asylum for the price of your admission. The acting was excellent and Hugh Grant pretty much cracked me up throughout. Colin Firth was a wonderful discovery though I know I ve seen him before - this was the first time I really sat up and took notice of just what a really talented actor he is. I was ready to cringe before I heard Renee Zellweger attempt the accent. But I soon found I could relax since she did an excellent job with it well more than enough to sound convincing to fellow Americans like myself anyway. Even more impressive though was the overall outstanding work she did with her character. If you enjoy light romantic comedy and being delightfully entertained, Bridget Jones is an excellent choice.
