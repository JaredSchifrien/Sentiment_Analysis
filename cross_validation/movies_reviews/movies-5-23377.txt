Easily one of the best movies ive seen in a long time, just second to Amores Perros. Eternal sunshine is one of the great love stories of our time told with great pace, inteligence and always avoiding corny spots (very non - hollywood). Very few movies have been this keen and this smart at trying to find the essence of love and of relationships in general between men and women. I used to hate Charlie Kaufman and dismiss him as an eccentric screenwriter in urgent need of a Valium or a mental institution, with this he reedems himself completely. Bravo! Mat√≠as Pontdebulle
