Once again, Rob Schinder proves he cannot act in another stupid, boring and crude comedy that has no life in it. Over 20 profanities are present in this film, with the f-word, AGAIN, being the most frequently-used one. Filmakers, please listen, profanity is NOT neccessary to make a film!!!! As you would expect from a (so-called) movie about Gigolos, sexual content runs rampant, with graphic descriptions of everything from masturbation to genitals present. And, of course, alcohol and drugs are present. But, I tell you one thing, that isn't present: a good actor! Avoid this movie altogether and hire some superheroes to save the world or galliant explorers to go where no one has gone before or some skilled trainers to catch 'em all...
