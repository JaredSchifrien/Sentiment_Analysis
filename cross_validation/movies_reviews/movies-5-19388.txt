Two brilliant actors. A fresh dark and cleverly written script. Great directing. What does it equal? A box office bomb as well as a genuinly thought provoking and memorable film. The power and hypnotic precense of this film is given substance by the director as well as Willem Dafoes legendary performance one that will never ever be topped. This movie is flat out beautiful. A true work of art. A Must See.
