The Passion directing was very poor. The only good thing about it was that the language fitted the setting. Besides that, editing and angle shots were not original. There is a big mistake at the end of the movie where Jesus' hands get nailed to the cross. It was discovered a few years ago that Jesus could not have been nailed by the hands, but rather the wrists. The nails could not support his weight. The movie focused too much on the one spectrum of Jesus' life as oppose to overall picture. Mary's portrayal could have been much more effective if she would have appeared to be more convulsive as to see her only son die. Instead, she had the occassional breakdown. It is difficult to imagine who is seeing her child tortured to lack expression and deeper emotion. Frankly, I dont believe Mel Gibson did this movie for the money, but nonetheless should stick to what he does best-acting, not directing movies.
