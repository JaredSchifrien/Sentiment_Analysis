I dont know about anybody else, but if you see this movie in the theatres, it will haunt you. This movie does a good job to get into your mind. The images were very eerie and hard to forget, the ghost was simply creepy. Also have some good scenes that make you jump. Very unpredictable, especially the ending, one of the most serious endings i've ever witnessed!
