This rating is on the movie only- not Speilberg's politics. Im suprised someone rated it 1 just because of politics. Anyway, theis is one fabulous movie. The special effects are great, the story gripping. Tom Hanks again puts on a flawless act. The ending battle is pretty good, so's the beggining, with little battles in between. A must see.
