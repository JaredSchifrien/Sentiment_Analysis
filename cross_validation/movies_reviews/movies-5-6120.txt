In the horror film genre, this is a reigning champ. I have never been a fan of the so called "slasher" movies, that contain no psychological angst, but rather the anticipation of the girl to fall in the forest ( which she always does ) and gets, well you know.... In what ever happened to Baby Jane, we see two dynamic legendary actresses displaying the best there is in this genre. Of couse the feuding between them in real life, only enhances the fire, this film is extremely well thought out, and the performances by these two ladies is fantastic. Bette Davis' face alone could scare the h**l out of anyone, and Joan is wonderful as always as the tormented bedridden sister. Through a collection of horrible circumstances, we are ultimately lead to an ending that makes us all contemplate "what will happen now?" and I personally love that aspect of filmaking. I don't always like to be told what to think, or to be given a nice neat little package to feel comfortable with. Extremely disturbing ( and Bette Davis singing only inhances this ) I would recommend this movie to any film lover, 5 stars to two iconic stars, who's light still shines just as brightley as ever!
