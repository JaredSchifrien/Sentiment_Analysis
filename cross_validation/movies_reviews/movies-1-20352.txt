aaaahhhhhhh, the most overrated movie of the year, it wasnt scary at all, this is a spoiler but i dont care, THERE ARE NO MOSNTERS IN THE FORREST, IT IS THE VILLAGE ELDERS DRESSING UP, IT IS SO FREAKING STUPID, THEY ARE IN A WILDLIFE REFUGE OUTSIDE OF MODERN DAY PHILADELPHIA, DONT SEE IT, I JUST RUINED IT FOR YOU ANYWAYS AND HOPEFULLY SAVED YOU MONEY!!!!
