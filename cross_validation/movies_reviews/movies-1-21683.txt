It just did not compare to my standard for great science fiction movies. It had a lot of forced dialog, which is always annoying, and it had lost the excitement and heroism of the first movie. It felt as if Lucas cared more about presenting his Hindu idealogy than about creating a great movie. I like science fictions that have more intellectual value, not ridiculous child play to the tune of eastern religeons.
