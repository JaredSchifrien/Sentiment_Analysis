Awful, cheesy, cheap sets that are reminiscent of 50's era B-grade sci-fi; emotionally manipulative storyline with little depth; unbelieveable scenarios that are supposed to make us cheer the good guys, but instead, make us wonder what were they thinking? and finally, a favorly canned ending. Another USA saves the world movie ala Independence Day!
