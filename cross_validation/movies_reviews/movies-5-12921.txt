Another incredible movie! When I first heard what it was about, I have to admit, I was not eager to see it. I rented it when it came out on video. I wish that I had seen it in the theatre. Not for the graphics (wasn't any really) but just to really get into the movie. To see it much better on the big screen. All of the actors did such an incredible job on this film, I thought they all deserved an Oscar!
