If the original is arguably the greatest film ever, 'The Godfather, Part II' is also definitely among the very best films ever put on the silver screen. Who can weave two stories together as well as Francis Ford Coppola? No one can. And if there is one thing that might make it stand out from the original film, it is the even greater acting on display. With respect to Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Lee Strasberg, and Michael Gazzo, I really don't think John Cazale as Fredo Corleone gets enough credit. Cazale gives the performance of a lifetime as the runt of a family of lions. The bottom line is that 'II' is every bit as ferocious and probably more cunning a film than the original. Standing by itself in moviedom, however, it sits Janus-faced in its historical importance, as generations of moviegoers are awed.
