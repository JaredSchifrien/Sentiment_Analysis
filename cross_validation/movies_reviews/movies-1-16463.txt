Truly dramatic and a bit corny. The dialogue did not fit in the modern day scene and it destroyed my love for the Shakespearian work. Leo's just not an impressive actor and I don't know what it is about him. I could never understand why many women thought he was/is attractive. The only thing I like about the movie is where Romeo and Tybalt battle. I think Leguizamo is a stunning actor in this movie. His costumes are amazing.
