I have just been to see Miss Congeniality and i was surprised at the amount of people that came to see the show,i personnely found it funny and it was great to see some old faces in the movie. Michael Cain and others.I also liked the fact that if you brought your children they would enjoy it too and they would find some of the parts really funny.
