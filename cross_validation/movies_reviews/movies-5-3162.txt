Great movie. Loved the directing. Very good performances by Busta Rhymes, Ray Liotta, Jason Patrick, and Chi McBride. The film is about Jason Patrick character, who is on leave because he shoots a pregnant woman on accident. He is actually called in to investigate the murder of a cop. Ray Liotta works side by side with him to get clues and monitor the investigation. A movie that works on so many levels.
