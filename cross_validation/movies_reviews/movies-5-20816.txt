I confess I read the other ratings to see where I was going to go with this. Considering Renee, Catherine, and Richard were all over televison saying that they really had never sung or danced before, they did a helluva job. Queen Latifah was cool, too -- certainly better than Della Reese in Harlem Nights. I was surprised that the story was as good as it was, considering it was a musical. The little Hitchcockian twist at the end was a hoot!
