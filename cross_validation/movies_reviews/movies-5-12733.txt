Perfect! Dead on in terms of it's political statments. Really funny to watch at times, such as when Micheal Moore goes to Canada and tries to figure out why we're not shooting each other. Also very saddening and touching as well. I really wanted to punch Charleton Heston in the face by the end of the film!
