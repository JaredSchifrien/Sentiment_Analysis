((Spoilers in here...not that anyone's going to see this flick again)) This movie was pure sap, emotional drivel in all its disgusting glory. You could tell when it's time to cry, because the piano ensemble would thunder in the background telling you to. It told me to cry when Patch's [much younger] girlfriend was cryptically killed, but rather than tear up, all I could do was think What the hell just happened?! The main message of this movie is: Rules are bad, authority is eeevil! And of course, acting like an idiot will cheer up all terminally ill people. I don't think I've ever seen a more mindless movie than this.
