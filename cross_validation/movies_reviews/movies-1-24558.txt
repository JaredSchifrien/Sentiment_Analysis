Incredibly horrible version of the classic H.G.Wells story, with ludicrously bad performances from everyone. Whatever happened to Jeremy Irons? He used to be a pretty good actor once upon a time. I'll tell you one thing, I would NEVER want to have to go up against that guy on the old game show "Make Me Laugh." Decent actor, but his career isn't merely going down the toilet, it's clogged in the pipes.
