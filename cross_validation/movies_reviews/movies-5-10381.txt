B-b-but this is such a great movie! Only thing I didn't like was Sigourney Weaver---Catherine was the wrong role for her to play. Why is this so far down? It was a crazy, laugh-out-loud movie, perfect for me since I am a crazy, laugh-out-loud kind of person! Anyone who doesn't like must just not like funny things, or else have a PROBLEM! The reviewer called alicat says it best. It is a good movie for it's time. And it's still a good movie!
