This is one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen. I was hoping Winona's character would get brutalised by one of the guards. She thoroughly deserved it - whinging on on in that horrid nasal voice of hers. I watched this movie with a doctor friend of mine who was working in a psychiatric hospital at the time. He said that the basic plot (they wouldn't let her out, even though she was a voluntary patient) completely lacked credence. As for Angela Jolie's character, there didn't apopear to be anything wrong with her. What was she doing in a nut house? As for having her undergo EST, as if any hospital would do that to a completely sane person against their will, even in the 60s! What a load of rubbish.
