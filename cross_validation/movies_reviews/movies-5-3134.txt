U-571 was a remake of the old movie called Das Boot and you get very involved in the plot. There were parts where everyone held their breath and then all you heard was about 110 people saying Oh my god, that was close! It's fairly low tech with no real special effects, but it is not needed. I also thought it was interesting because it's based on true facts from the World War.
