There are many great films out there, but I can only be sure of three that are the greatest of all-time. Citizen Kane is one of them. There is no way that you can over-estimate the influence this film has had on movies. From its revolutionary narrative structure to its immensely innovative camera tricks, Kane offered a glimpse into the real world at a time when films were still creating alternate ones. Orson Welles was truly a visionary. He, along with such greats as Alfred Hitchcock, John Ford and D.W. Griffith perfected the motion picture, made it an art form and fashioned it into what it has evolved into today. Citizen Kane IS the greatest film ever made.
