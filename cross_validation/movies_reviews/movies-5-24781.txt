The special affects were astounding (better than most high budget films) and the acting reflected the tones that a D D player speaks and acts when playing the game. I liked how they had Richard O'Brien and the Maze in Antius City. (For those who have not been out of the US, Richard O'Brien hosted a game show called the Crystal Maze)
