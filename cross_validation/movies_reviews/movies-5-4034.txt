Pixar did it again! Another really good, funny film. The visuals were amazing, and Ellen Degeneres as Dory was hilarious. The expressions on the characters were incredible so that you're actually feeling all that they're feeling: sad, scared, happy, whatever. All the voices worked well with the animation. You don't have to be a kid to like this movie! I loved it. You have to see it in the theatre though to get the full effect with the surround sound.
