This one is a classic! Come on. Sure the plot was a bit out of whack, but the acting and the dialogue made this movie so hilarious. My favorite scene is probably either the wedding scene at the end or when Bettlejuice is trying to get Lydia to guess his name. Michael Keaton was the perfect choice for the role of Bettlejuice. I'll always enjoy watching this movie- it's a classic! I'm the ghost with the most, babe.
