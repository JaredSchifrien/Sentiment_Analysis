Milos Forman directed this musical that was made and released at the wrong time (1979). It would have probably been a blockbuster if it were made during the time the film depicts. But it's still a great movie, and a fun musical. The performances are quite good, especially considering the leads (Treat Williams, Beverly D'Angelo, and John Savage) are not known as singers. The choreography by Twyla Tharp fits right in with the feel of the movie. And it's kinda fun to see Charlotte Rae (Mrs. Garrett from Facts of Life TV show) and Nell Carter (who belts out a couple of songs) in small cameos.
