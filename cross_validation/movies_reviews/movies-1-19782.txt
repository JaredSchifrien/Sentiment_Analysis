It's time to bury Jason once & for all. And this time don't resurrect him. I'd rather stick my head in a grabage can and inhale deeply than sit through another movie like this. Cheesy, cheap & pointless. We have the usual nearly naked girls, some teasing throw in with the slicing and dicing by Jason. I know it's a free country, but we ought to consider a law banning sequels like this.
