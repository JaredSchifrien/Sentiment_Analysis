Event Horizon rules. One of the best sci-fi/horror/hounting movie set in outer space you ever get. You have to get some guts to see the blood though, BUT it is not a movie about blood. It is pure monster-less horror. Really hounted! My sci-fi number #2 after MATRIX! Sadly there are people who don't think this way, but it is really underrated movie.
