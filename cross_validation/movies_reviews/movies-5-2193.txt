One of the few sequels that actually lived up to the original. This was due to the addition of Joe Pesci who added freshness to this movie. Whenever I go through a fast-food drive-thru, I think of Leo Getz. It included the action of the first one and more humor than the first. Gibson and Glover solidified their standing as one of the best acting tandems in recent years.
