My goodness this movie blew. It got my attention with that awesome beginning. But once the movie started? I won't even go there... Byonce Knoles is to Jive to be funny. In fact, It's friggin annoying. The next time I hear someone say Jive Turkey or Shuga like that again I'm gonna Explode! Not only that, but Goldmember sucks. He is gross, stupid, and also very annoying. The movie only squeezed a couple of giggles out of me. Most of this movie's humor is when one of the antagonists trying to explain something stupid or gross while the other person just sits there staring with a confused look on their face until he is done. Honestly I feel they do this too much in this movie, like when Fat Bastard is trying to explain how bad his fart stinks, or when Goldmember says his stupid Fashza stuff. The only funny parts to me were the beginning, the mole, the subtitles, (ha ha!) and the shadow scene. Other than that, this movie just plain shameless advertising. The Brittney and Ozbourne Cameos were obviously put in there to appeal to their respective audiences. and let us not forget the biggest Audience appeal role of them all: Byonce Knowels herself. The only good Austin Powers chick was Vanessa she is irreplacealble. I think I've seen the bottom of the Austin Powers barrel with this stinker of a comedy movie.
