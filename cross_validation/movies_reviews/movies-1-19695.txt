I have yet to see a movie as poorly directed, poorly written, and poorly acted (except by Jackman) as this one. I was SO looking forward to it, being a big Universal Monster fan myself. This movie was supposed to be a dream come true. Instead I got a convoluted plot, with mediocre special effects (a Stephen Sommers tradition), and the least believable romanian accents in the history of cinema (including that guy at the beginning of Eyes Wide Shut). This movie should be shown in every film academy throughout the world as a cautionary example of what happens when a GREAT idea is given to a mediocre director who, by the way, believes he can translate said idea into a plot and screenplay. Awful awful awful awful awful awful awful!!!!!!!!
