OMG!!! Jack Here's Johnny Nicholson is awesome in this. I saw this when I was about 13 and I was very scared, especially since I lived in Denver then. I can not watch this film alone cause I get scared! The only thing that I regret to say in about the movie is that it is not a lot like the Stephen King novel. I had once read an article about King and he was very disappointed w/ the movie because it was so unlike his book. But.. it was a great movie anyway!
