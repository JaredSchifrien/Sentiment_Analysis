I could ramble on endlessly about how the act in which Anakin returns to Tatooine to save his mother is handled in a manner that makes it seem like time-filler, or how the budding romance between Anakin and Padme, and the inner-decension of Anakin into Darth Vader do not pack the emotional jolt that they could or should, but I won't I just sat back in the theater twice and enjoyed what I saw. Once you learn to enjoy a film without hanging on its short-comings, then you've begun to develope your own opinions and personal feelings of the cinema. I enjoyed Attack of the Clones immensely, and hope to see it again soon. Because I enjoyed it so much, I give it 5 stars, despite the fact that it's only worth 4.
