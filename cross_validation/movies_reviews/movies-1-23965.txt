Why is this so high on the list?!! -- I'll fix that. People, this is part of the Really Bad Existentialist Trilogy (with 1 5). The fountain of youth planet does not a good and believable plot make. This plays like an overlong episode of the series, and indeed, essentially rips off some of the same plots from The Next Gen series. All the attempts at humor are flat, stupid, and downright embarrassing, and all the regulars seem ashamed to be in this movie. There are some good parts here and there, but as a whole, it desperately needed a lot of work.
