Erin Brockovich would definately be on my top ten list of great movies. I feel it deserves a much higher placement on this RateItALllist because not only was it a riveting, interesting, timely film circling on an important issue, it was based on a true story and landmark legal case! And if any of you reading think I only really like it so much because I'm a big Julia Roberts fan, think again because I was one of the very few people who hated Pretty Woman. Actually I didn't think Roberts was good in any of her many films, except maybe Sleeping With the Enemy. - But in Erin Brockovich, Roberts really amazed me! She not only performed the part flawlessly, but she just seemed to belong to the story. She was one with the story and the spirit of the story. Julia Roberts deserved her Academy Award for this film.
