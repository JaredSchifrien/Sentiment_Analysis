i was shaky about giving this movie five stars, but deep down, i think it's worth it. it's fine storytelling. okay, the kingpin is a little too mu-hu-ha-ha-ha sometimes, and the carnage of the fight scenes tends to detract from the characters' identities... if only you could have two and a half hours of posturing and line delivery, like you do in the comics. to some extent, elektra is just a girl with sais, daredevil is just a creep in a kinky costume, and kingpin is just a hood. bullseye is just deranged, and he's a lot of fun. but this movie's got heart, and it's incredibly well shot and timed out, and it has a great sense of humor. it stays faithful to the comic as much as it can, with affleck (p-u) nailing murdock, who more or less is a mannequin in the books, when not flaying somebody's ass. the supporting characters are extremely well done, almost to the point of overkill, and everybody in the movie seems to be willing to bring this silly superhero story to life. of all the comic book vigilantes ever to hit the screen, this torn up, beat up, drugged up, messed up guy is the best and most believable, and maybe the most cheerable. a definite must see.
