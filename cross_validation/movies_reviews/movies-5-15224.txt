I loved this movie. It's better than the original Cinderella story, much more real. The characters come to life. Drew Barrymore is an excellent Cinderella. She's not one of those toothpick thin girls but a real woman-she has a shape and shows it. The costumes were wonderful and Anjelica Huston as the step-mother was great! A good find for the entire family to watch on a cold winter's night or afternoon when school's canceled.
