This is & always will be one of my most favorite movies ever. The costumes are great, the music is fabulous, the special effects were state of the art in the 80s, David Bowie looks REALLY hawt, & it's funny! Normally I dislike George Lucas stuff & Henson's creepy muppets, but they actually made the movie better.
