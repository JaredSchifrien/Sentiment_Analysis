I've never really liked having to read my movie as I'm watching it -- in other words, following subtitles. But this movie was different, somehow. The father worked so hard to protect his son from the horrors of war and of genocide, to keep his son's innocence and love (and possibly trust) for humanity. Some parts were so funny that it was almost painful to laugh, because they also made me cry; I was basically laughing through my tears. The film was heartbreaking, true, but it was uplifting and beautiful, especially the end. After watching this movie, I was trembling from head to toe and didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Amazing movie!
