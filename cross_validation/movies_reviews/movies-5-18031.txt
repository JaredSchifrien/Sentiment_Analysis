this was a scary movie. in the era of slasher films of friday the 13th and halloween carrie was a deeper film in which the main character is both good and bad. your scared of her yet also feel really sorry for her. hard to do with a jason or mike myers. carrie had depth. this was and still is the best steven king movie version of one of his novels bar none. very good use of lighting and atomsphere in this movie. for me two images stay with me the prom scene of course but much more frightening were the closet scenes with cruifix and jesus with the glowing eyes. very creepy.
