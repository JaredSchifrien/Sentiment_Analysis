Austin Powers, from the beginning to the end, is really funny. For instance when he is dancing on the street and the cop walks up to them, they all stop dancing, then start again with the cop dancing too. And Dr. Evil is no doubt the most lovable evil villain ever. His wild schemes that always get messed up make his character excellent. 5 stars for sure.
