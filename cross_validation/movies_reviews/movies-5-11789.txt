Although not up to par of TV's Frasier or I Love Lucy or the cinematic genius of Toy Story 2 or Airplane! , it is certainly a funny movie that is easily enjoyable. Sight gags, word puns, product placement, modern references, and funny sound effects round out a great plot with a hilarious ending. And, the sequel is really in the planning stages! Let's hope the evil Betty doesn't team up with Moon-You again...
