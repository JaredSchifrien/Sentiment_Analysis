i've recently dubbed this the greatest Super-Hero movie I have evern seen. Second, being the equally entertaining X-men. Spidey has all the action and origin intrigue of a great hero film as well as some superbly directed shots. Tobey McGuire is clearly a fantastic choice as exuberant yet nedry shy, Peter Parker. Willem Defoe is frightening in general. He's much worse as the Green Goblin. Also, another benefit of having these actors is the smart way in which they pull off the typically comic book dialogue. Both DeFore and McGuire give the movie some classy weight...as does Kirsten Dunst. One can hope this style of film making will be a constant throughout the budding Spider-man franchise....unless McGuire bolts or they get Joel Schumaker to direct, they should be fine.
