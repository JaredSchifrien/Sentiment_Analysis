I have seen this movie more than twenty times and could see it twenty times more! Besides the fact that this film has an incredible plot, a sharp script, expert direction, brilliant acting, and an awe-inspiriring score: let's not forget the editing! The roundup and the interrogation room scenes are a film editor's wet dream! And the last ten minutes of the movie was exhilerating! Especially that one shot of Kevin walking like a cripple and then walking normal! God, that was breathtaking!!!! This film won best original screenplay and best supporting actor for Kevin, but it deserved to win so much more!
