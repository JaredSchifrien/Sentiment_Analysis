Two days ago I saw Stigmata was overwhelmed! In fact I can't say witch one out of Forrest Gump Stigmata is the best I've ever seen - cause their both perfect! It puts As Good As It Gets as the third best I've seen. Just before I went into the cinema, I read an huge Norwegian news paper given the movie one out of six stars. It was the first I've ever read about the movie. When I came out of the movie, I felt like a new spiritual person. Throughout the whole movie I freezed on my back! I've just had one similar experienced, with Forrest Gump. Then I didn't freeze, I cried. For the first time in my life that I can remember, I freezed so intensely that I actually made me cry! The movie is extremely powerful, both when it comes to pictures/colours/scripts sounds, especially the combination! But unlike most movies, especially horror/thrillers [!!] it had a mission! The story made me look at the world with new eyes, like I was a five years old child discovering the realities in life the laws of the universe. It didn't only critize the Vatican Church, it also had something to tell the atheists among us. I feel more agnostic less atheistic now than before the movie. Forget the X-Files, forget the stories of people who claim they've met aliens ufos, forget the 'political correct use of violence' in Fight Club - Stigmata hits much harder! How could this extraordinary movie only get 6.1/10 from the IMDb.com users? Maybe because it's too controversial for them? Maybe because they were afraid of the film's message? Remember what a person said about Stigmata: Leave religion out of cinema! . Maybe they're afraid that their religious brainwashness will be washed away by the director? Even though I haven't seen The Exorcist, I will claim that it has nothing to do with it the reason is this: Stigmata is original because it's more than entertainment, it's also thought-provoking! :-D
