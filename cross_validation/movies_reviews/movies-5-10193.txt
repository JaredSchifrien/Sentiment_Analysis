This is great! I was blown away the first time I saw it, it's hilarious, sad, everything. Peter Sellers is absolutely wonderful as Chance, and Being There is just a great movie. I loved the atmosphere, and I don't think I can find much wrong with it. You should see it if you're a movie fan. Being There is great. Summary: HILARIOUS, SAD, GREAT. SELLERS IS MARVELOUS.
