Is 'Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2' stupid? YES! Perhaps the stupidest film to come out in a long time, the idiots who gave the go to make a sequel out of the originally lame 'Baby Genuises' ought to be tarred and feathered for wasting millions of dollars on such worthlessness. This movie, like its predecessor, has no humor- nor does it have any real meaning to it. This movie, in short, is a disgrace almost as bad as the total failure of moviedom from years back: 'The Jerky Boys Movie'. Perhaps the only positive thing about this movie is that it can't possibly be as bad as 'The Jerky Boys Movie'. But it comes fairly close.
