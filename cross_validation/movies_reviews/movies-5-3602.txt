Lethal Weapon 4 brings a satisfying close to an action series that I consider to be one of the best. Like its predacessor, Lethal Weapon 4 dealt with a real-life issue (the issue of Chinese oppression and immigration corruption), and it made for a solid story. There were some great action scenes and comedy. The biggest props have to go to Joe Pesci and Chris Rock, who had such surprisingly good comedic chemistry on screen together. Glover, Gibson and Russo are solid as always. Jet Li is satisfying as the main villian. Overall, Lethal Weapon 4 is a fine addition (and ending) to this explosive action series.
