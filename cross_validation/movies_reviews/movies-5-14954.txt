This movie was I think the best movie that Mel Gibson has ever played a role in. He was fantastic. This movie made me look at our country's history of war in a different prospective. Although it may have been a movie, it made me realize how it was for the men fighting for our country's freedom. It really brought tears to my eyes and I celebrated the 4th of July in a whole different light this year!
