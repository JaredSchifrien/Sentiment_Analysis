I just got back from seeing Spider-Man 2 and it was very good. The danger of waiting to see a movie like this is all the hype and nothing can stand up to that. That said it was not as great as I was led to believe. Couple of scenes seemed a bit over the top and out of place. The rain drops keep falling on my head bit, I could have done with out. Also M.J not appearing during the death march, I mean wedding march was more than a little predictable. A lot of action and many great special effects. No acting Oscars for this but the cast pulled it off. So the wait begins for Spidey 3, do you believe in Hob Goblins?
