Powerful, touching, amazing, wonderful. It was absolutly the movie of the year. Better yet, it was based on truth. Mel Gibson was incredible and this was well thought of. It was different. So what? I agree with Bird808 and how people were saying that this movie was violent. It was violence that actually happened. The rating which is R stands for rememberence and repentance and realization. It does have blood and it does have graphic images and it will make you want to close your eyes at times. But this movie was so wondefully put together with truth and gospel and with God most of all. Very well done.
