'The Godfather' is simply one of the greatest (if not the greatest ever). This movie has it all, and anyone who has ever sat down to watch it is immediately pulled into the world of the Corleones for the entire length of the movie. With the mixture of storyline and casting, along with the light and dark, this movie captures the very essence of what filmmaking is all about and more. 'The Godfather' is art at its finest- MAGNIFICENT!!!
