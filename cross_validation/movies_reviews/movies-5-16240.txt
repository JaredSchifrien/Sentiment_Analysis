Amazingly beautiful to look at and listen to. The secret of the Red Violin was a little disturbing to me, but I was touched when I realized why the violin craftsman did what he did (you have to watch the movie to know what I'm talking about!) I also bought the soundtrack recently and it's an incredible accomplishment - according to the CD liner notes, the musical score was composed before the movie was even finished shooting, which is exactly the reverse from the way musical scores are usually done. The effect is a movie that feels ingeniously inspired by the music rather than the other way around. Highly recommended for violin and music enthusiasts.
