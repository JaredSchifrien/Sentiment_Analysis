An excellent film. This is not just a movie, but a film that should be rated among the classics of all time. It is a fine example of films on the grand scale, such as Cecil B. DeMille. What is more important is the subject of the film. Gandhi was an amazing man. A three hour film only touches the surface of this man. You will be transformed by the grace and dignity of the man and wonder why the world has not created more Gandhi's.
