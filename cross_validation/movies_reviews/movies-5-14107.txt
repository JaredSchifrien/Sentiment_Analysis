First thing to get straight is that this is not meant to be some cak comedy but is an amusing satire on media power gone out of control. Carrey at lasts drops the gurning and turns in a decent performance here. On first viewing the film turns up some nice little surprises such as when he discovers his family isnt real. Much better than copycat films like Ed TV, this is an original and thought provoking movie.
