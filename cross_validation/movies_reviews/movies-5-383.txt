Wonderful movie, despite the gore. B G (blood guts) seem to be an integral part of films now, and I think it heightens the realism. Crowe, Phoenix, Reed, Nielsen and Harris did a fabulous job in this. I recommend it to anyone who has the stomach for innate realism. Way better than Patriot. (Sorry Melfans...)
