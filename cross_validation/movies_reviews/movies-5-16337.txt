I think that cajunmafia should be a bit less literal. How many people actually know that? Anyway, for all you people that said that the movie was too gorey, well, there was no choice! The movie could not even describe what pain Jesus went through during that time. Sure the movie was grusome, bet it was still a great picture. All the people that liked saving Private Ryan but didn't like this movie because it was too gorey or it was too real should snap out of it. What Jesus went through was far worse that war. Some say that war is a living hell, well Jesus went through hell and took a trip back. -By the way, I think Canada Sucks should learn a little more about Jesus and God before he says things like that. This movie was not supposed to be funny!!
