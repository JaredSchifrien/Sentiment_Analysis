To say that I dislike this movie is an understatement, I loath it. Lost in Translation was a painful movie to watch. I know that the point of this movie is to feel the character's alienation, but I didn't sympathetic towards the characters. WAAAAAA, Japan is such a strange country, my life is so boring. Lost in Translation is an overrated piece of fluff!
