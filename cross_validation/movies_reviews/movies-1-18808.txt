If I could give this movie a minus rating, I would. This movie sucked so bad, I got my money back at the ticket booth! Don't waste your time on this one, or your money. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! They just don't make horror movies with any real horror in them nowadays. The last movie that actually made me pick my feet up off the floor in sheer terror was The Exorcist . Do yourself a favor, rent a classic, and hold your honey tight.
