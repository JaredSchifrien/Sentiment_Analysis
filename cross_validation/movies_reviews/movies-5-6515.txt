I really respect Chaplin for having the presence of mind and heart to make this movie. It wasn't necessarily brave - Hollywood was very anti-Nazi at the time. It was very compassionate of him to think of the plight of the Jews and to presume what their fate would be. He nailed Adenoid/Adolf, and Mussollini, and the whole dirty group. The movie speaks for itself - one of the greatest examples of tragi-comedy.
