This is definitely my favorite Hitchcock movie. It effectively capitalizes on people's desires to watch others. I was always wondering what Jimmy Stewarts' character would see in his neighbor's windows next. Then it became increasingly dark and suspenseful when he suspected one of his neighbors of murder. The buildup of suspense in this movie was masterful and showcased what made Hitchcock such a great director!
