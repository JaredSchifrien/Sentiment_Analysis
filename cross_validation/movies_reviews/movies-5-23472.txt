I enjoy the occasional fantasy film but admit that I m not the biggest Sci-fi buff in the universe. However, I will go out on a limb and say that this may possibly be the most meaningful film in that genre since The Day the Earth Stood Still . The first thing I noticed is that, unlike many of today s SciFi/Fantasy films, you do not start out as though you have suddenly been transported into a video game on steroids. Absent is the constant panic-stricken mode and non-stop breakneck speed. Instead, Signs draws you in slowly and proceeds to unfold at a nice even pace. The film features believable characters that you get to know and like going through their daily routine in a realistic location. This sense of reality is the key element that makes the more fantastic part of the story work so well; it provides the right environment for the seed of possibility to grow in the mind of the viewer. Signs is a very well done story with an excellent cast. The big plus is that this one not only gives you time to think but something to think about.
