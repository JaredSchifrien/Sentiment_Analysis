This is one of the best sci-fi sequels in history. It created a darker mood than Star Wars: A New Hope, and really created depth to the characters in the film. Luke becomes stronger and learns his ties to Darth Vader, and as a filler movie in a trilogy it still holds its own. For a spaghetti space western it remains as one of the most fun and action packed stories in American pop culture.
