Witness, my friends, the crude of the crude: I can see this movie being used by women for evidence to kick guys off of the planet forever. At least, they should kick off mindless fools like the actors and writers of this numbingly-idiotic motion picture. In what has to be a record of some sort, over 200 (yes, you read it right, my friends, TWO HUNDRED) uses of the f-word can be cataloged. That's in addition to over 150 OTHER crude words. This makes you wonder if there could actually be any real dialogue. Of course, there is none. Crude and explicit sexual content is so crass and rampant that I can't get into it on this honorable public opinion forum. Drug use rivals the moronic Cheech Chong movies. Acting is bad, and I mean BAAAAADDDDD! Of course, George Carlin makes an appearance, so it is automatically bad. They've even got kids cussing in this movie! No child actor should be forced into a movie like this one! The list of crimes in this brain-dead movie goes on: its sexist, it has inappropriate music, there is imitative behavior that kids shouldn't replicate, graphic violence and disrespectful attitudes towards women and policemen. This movie is one of the worst movies of all time, that is for sure. Avoid this terror at all costs. Just go rent something nice and family-friendly, read a book, play a Nintendo game or write a story of your own. But, whatever you do, pay this waste of film no heed.
