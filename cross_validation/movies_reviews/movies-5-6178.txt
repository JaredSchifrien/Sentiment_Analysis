There's a whole, whole lot going on in this movie - nine lives for all her different ways of life, masks, comedy, tragedy, pathos...I like the undercurrent of seaminess - Peppard's a gigolo and it's never actually stated but Hepburn appears to be something of a call girl. I like how she's loveable and cold at the same time. Capote really captured how flighty women like this tick. She's so cute you forgive her nuttiness. The ending with the cat in the rain is a tearjerker. I fell in love with this film.
