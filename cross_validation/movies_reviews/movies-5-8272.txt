More than a comedy, this is an all-around excellent film. Cage and Hunter are marvellous as a couple who, out of desperation, take matters into their own, though somewhat confused, hands. This film could have been dark or jaded, but it was handled with such a light touch that it turns out to be a positive affirmation of love and hope.
