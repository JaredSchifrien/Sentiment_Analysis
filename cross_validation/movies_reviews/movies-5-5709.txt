Had this movie not had such a charming cast, rousing score or any mass appeal, I don't think it would be the movie it is today. Personally, while I do like it very much and think it is deserving of a four star rating, GONE WITH THE WIND, I wasn't too impressed with it. The first half is spectacular, while the second half moves slower than a car in the middle of rush hour. Still, it is a great film, somewhat deserving of it's praise.
