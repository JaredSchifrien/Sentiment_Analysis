I just saw this movie last night with a huge group of friends, and I think if all of them hadn't been there, I would have had a nervous breakdown. This movie is terrifying from start to finish, from it's message of Don't peek to it's instruction to stay in the light. I normally don't get very freaked out at movies, but this one made me want to close my eyes and catch my breath. It's an excellent movie that makes you afraid to sleep with your light off. The ending is a little weak compared to the rest of the film, but overall it's a wonderfully scary movie that plays on your emotions and your psychological well-being!
