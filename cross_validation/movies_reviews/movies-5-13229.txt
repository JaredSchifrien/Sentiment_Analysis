One of the only Tom Cruise movies I liked. Dustin Hoffman plays his role perfectly as a mentally handicapped man who's greedy brother kidnaps him from the home that he'd been living. Hoffman's character is an idiot savant, his brother kidnaps him in hopes that he will get his brother's share of the estate that his father left him, that he felt was rightfully his. They travel across country together and Cruise learns who his brother really is. You almost like Cruise by the end of the movie.
