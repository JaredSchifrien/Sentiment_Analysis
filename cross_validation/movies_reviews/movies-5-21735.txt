Another one of my favourite films from last year. Peter Jackson please take a bow for delivering one of the greatest three cinematic films of all time. The Lord of the Rings trilogies are going to be remembered for many years to come. Where some films fail to make the third or second part of their sequels deliver, all three of The Lord of the Rings films equally delivered. They excited the audiences and most importantly remained true to the book.
