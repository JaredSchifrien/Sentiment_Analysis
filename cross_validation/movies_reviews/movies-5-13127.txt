Not only is this an important film to see because of the subject matter - it is also a well-made, well-acted film. I've heard so many people say that the only reason why this movie won anything was because it was about the Holocaust, and how could you say you don't like a Holocaust movie? Well, a well-made film is a well-made film; social statement or not.
