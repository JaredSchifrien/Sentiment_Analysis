This rating is based on the movie itself, and not on it being a religious movie being rated by a devout and loudmouthed Atheist. SImply on it's artistic merit, THE PASSION simply wasn't any good. The acting seemed forced and unemotional. As for the story, I noticed several errors. Just to name a few: The flogging went on too long. I believe the Romans practiced the forty save one method of flogging (I.E. 39 lashes) I counted well over fifty lashes. The Romans didn't pound nails into the hand, they went through the wrist. Yes, I know it showed Jesus tied to the cross as well, but this wasn't done, as it increased the time it took the poor victim to die. Peter's three denials could have been taken as one, having all been lumped together as one incident. In reality, they were propably more spread out. And if Jesus was already dead, why did the blood and water come out with such force? Dead, no Heartbeat, No force pushing out the blood and water. Not a very accurate film. Mel Gibson should be ashamed at himself for putting out this dreck.
