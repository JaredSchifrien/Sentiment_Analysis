Was NOT based on a true story, contrary to what the movie claims. I don't care. I was surprised that Austin Powers was ranked higher than this one, and then more surprised that this wasn't even ranked...ah, they don't call this comedy?? I have a theory...if you're not from the upper midwest, you probably can't relate enough to the movie to really enjoy it. My favorite scene? The interrogation of the driveway sweeper! Gotta love the parkas!
