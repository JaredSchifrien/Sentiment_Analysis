This movie is great!! Julia Roberts gives her best performance. I agree she should be, at the least, be considered for an Oscar nomination. As for her dress code in this movie, I've heard from my friend that the true Erin said in Oprah that her actual dressing style is even more revealing than Robert's in the film. So, for those of you who feel offended with the sexy style, just know that the real Erin dressed even sexier than that. What's up with that, anyway? I've seen women dressed sexier than Robert in the film. Didn't you see Jennifer Lopez??
