What kind of drivel is this? It doesn't bother me that it is black and white, because some of my favorite movies (Bringing Up Baby, Aresnic and Old Lace) are black and white. What does bother me is the complete and utter lack of talent and creativity found in this overrated film. The entire setting and situation is wholly uncreative. A gas station? Good grief. Also the dialogue is peppered with mean-natured scatalogical jokes and the foulest of words. Kevin Smith should have never gotten into business.
