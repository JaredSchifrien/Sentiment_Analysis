One of the greatest and most acclaimed American films of all time. Bogart plays his character in a perfectly ambivalent fashion, and Bergman is lovely. The film is the epitome of film noir, so if you don't like the quality or any other movies from that period, this probably won't make a difference. The film has at its essence a profiteer's love for an unattainable woman with whom he had a previous relationship. The story is classic, and any description fails to do it justice. Remember though, this film has very little action, and some of the scenes rely on the audience using their visual sense rather than dialogue.
