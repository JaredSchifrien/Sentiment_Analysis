This must be one of the best films Tom Cruise has ever been in. His character is very realistic and has depth. Renee Zellweger is very convincing as a young single mother - and the boy who plays her son is outstanding as well. I can't think of a single actor in the film who isn't particularly good - and thats rare. The movie runs along very smoothly and the music matches the tempo of it. It reflects that society now works too hard and often forgets that there are other things in life to think and enjoy. It also points out that in the workplace, you can never really know what people think about you. I love this film, when I want to feel soppy and realise that what I have in life is so amazing (my partner, our flat, and just about everything) and I am so lucky.
