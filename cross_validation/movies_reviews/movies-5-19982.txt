I have seen a lot of horror movies and I think that this was one of the best. I admit that the movie relied a lot on special effects but that was the great part about it. I also like movies with a great story line to it and anybody who really paid attention to the movie and not to just how many special effects there were realized that the movie had a great story line. And, how can you deny the actors and actresses. They were what really made the movie great. It was just all around a great movie.
