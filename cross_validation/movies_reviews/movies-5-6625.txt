A simple, searingly honest film, the kind that current Hollywood filmmakers have evidently forgotten how to make... must viewing for any classic film fan. Marty is a film with a message, about how intolerant society can often be towards those who - for whatever reason - don't couple up after a certain age. Again and again at the start of the film, the central character is assaulted by the shrill, abrasive, demeaning words, Marty, you're STILL single? You should be ashamed of yourself!...by customers/aquaintances at his place of work (butchershop). But instead of telling them to proverbially shove it, he takes their words to heart, and as a result, feels increasingly lonely, distraught, alienated and hopeless about life. To me, Marty seems like a quinessential 1950's film, as it captures the period, it's attitudes and style well within an urban setting. Highly recommended for young and old alike.
