My all time favoite suspense movie! Kevin Spacey is superb as Verbal Kint, a character you will never forget. And of course you can't ignore the Oscar caliber performance of Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton. The ending is one that can never be forgotten even by the most jaded of movie critics. A MUST SEE!
