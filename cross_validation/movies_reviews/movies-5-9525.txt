I really didn't expect to enjoy this movie. I thought the first one was chuckle-worthy at best, but not especially humorous. I went to see it only because one of my friends is a huge fan of all things Asian (espeically Jackie Chan)and she asked me to. I settled in my chair, ready to be bored with the usual unfunny sequel fare and surprised myself when I actually started laughing out loud to the antics of (the still annoying. nothing can help this man)Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan (His best American Comedy to date.)It was nice to see Zhang ZiYi(don't think I spelled that right) again after her amazing turn in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. I would highly recommened this movie to anyone in need of a mindless good laugh. Most big time movie conossuiers(damn I can't spell) would not ever even think to see this movie, knowing how inane it is supposed to be, but I think that they would be a little surprised. I know I was.
