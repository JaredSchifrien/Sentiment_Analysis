I'm not really sure why I like this movie. I've seen it many times, and still can't quite put my finger on it - like there's something underneath the surface of the script bubbling up from the sand of Arabia. Very homoerotic - it's an all-male movie, which I think is why they cast O'Toole, to give it a feminine edge. The Turkish bath scene and his rape are infamous, and were ahead of their time for their shock value and adult content. Lean turned a not-so-interesting story into a sweeping, epic, extravaganza. I lump this one with Bridge over River Kwai for dumb, arrogant Brits in foreign lands.
