On the list of truly, historic, great films of all time you may see movies like Saving Private Ryan, Back To The Future, Jurassic Park, Shogun, Citizen Kane, Star Wars, or Rocky. But, no matter the movie critic of the list, The Godfather is always near the top. IN this four hour mafia epic.....never mind. Who needs to describe the Godfather!? It's filled with power and lust, greed and ignorance, law and crime. A true masterpiece of the American Film.
