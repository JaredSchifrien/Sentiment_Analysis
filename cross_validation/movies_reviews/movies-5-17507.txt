In a traditional Danish farming community,a severe father forbids one of his 3 sons to marry the daughter of a man of different religious convictions. Not likely to appeal to viewers with a low attention span or fans of breakneck-speed action(and a film which i was certainly slow to appreciate),this simple tale of faith does ask for thoughtful concentration.Its virtues -exquisitely composed decor and exceptional control of black,white and grey tones-unfold slowly,quietly,to almost transcendental effect.As one director asked, how can such perfection exist? .
