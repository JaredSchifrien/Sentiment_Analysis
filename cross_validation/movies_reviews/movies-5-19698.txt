This is a fantastic movie!!! Great special effects, lovable and funny characters and a real adventure ride. Hugh Jackman is brilliant as Van Helsing, and Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous and sexy as always. All up it's a movie experience, must see on the big screen. You will enjoy it from the beginning to the end, I promise!
