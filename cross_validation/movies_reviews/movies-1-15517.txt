A terrible film that deserves to be sunk (cool pun fully intended!) Entirely predictable, the film, instead of focusing on the plot of the ship or the fascinating technical blunders that occured, focus on a yawn-inducing romance. Of course, the ending is obvious to anyone who knows history...but...I wrote a short story (used as a prologue in a story of my own) where the crew of the Enterprise (along with such allies as Mario, Sonic, some Power Rangers, etc.) save the Titanic and introduce the lead male character to video games and fast food, therby preventing the nude paintings from occuring. :) I also snuck in a cameo of Mr. Limpet and a reference to Ariel, Starfleet's first mermaid. :)
