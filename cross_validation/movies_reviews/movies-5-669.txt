This is the best movie about the Vietnam war to come out of Hollywood. Kubrick's meticulous analysis of military conditioning is a stark condemnation of the American ideologies that caused the Holocaust in Vietnam. Vincent D'Onofrio's chilling portrayal of a mentally disturbed soldier is reason enough to see this film.
