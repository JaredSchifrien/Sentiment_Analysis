I cannot understand why people are so hard on Pearl Harbor. I thought it was a great movie, it was so awesome!!!!! I sat in the theater looking at the screen in awwww!!!!!!. The Japanese attack scene was both realistic and terrifying. The acting was decent.Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett both gave good performances. Jon Voight was a great FDR ,and ALec Baldwin was good too as Jimmy Doolittle. KATE BECKINGSALE WAS SO HOT!!!!! I'm buying this movie on DVD whenit is released. People may complain about the love story, but that is what had most of them watching Titanic a thousand damn times in the theater. I love both Titanic and Pearl Harbor and I'm a guy.
