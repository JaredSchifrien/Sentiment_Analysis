There is a child in all of us and this classic proves it. It remains my movie of choice on rainy weekends. I have never read the book but I know my imagination could not create the magnificant landscaping presented in this film. And there are songs galore that are easy to sing along to. Some scenes may be frightening to a small child -- I still close my eyes during the gondola ride!
