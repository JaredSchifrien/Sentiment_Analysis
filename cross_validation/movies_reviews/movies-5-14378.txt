This is a GREAT film, not so much for the story content, which has been done before and will be done again, but for its presention. This is an all-out assault on the senses... visually, audially, emotionally. Ellen Burstyn gives an Oscar caliber performance that has you living her descent into addiction and psychosis right along with her. This is one actress Hollywood should start paying more attention to... her best work may still be yet to come.
