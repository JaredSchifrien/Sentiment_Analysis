More 4.51, than 5. Still, satisfying and compelling closure to the Star Wars Sexlogy (Is that a word?). The action sequences were the best of any Star Wars episode -- particularly the light saber duels which rivaled Kill Bill for quality martial arts skill. My only gripe was the movie lagged a bit during the middle. I'm not a Star Wars geek, but there was one technical flaw I noted; the actor playing Annakin is not particularly tall. Yet Darth Vader is humongous (In fact, in the original Star Wars, British bodybuilder Dave Prowse was the man in the Vader suit). Come Oscar time, will the Academy give George Lucas his proper due and nominate Star Wars III for best Picture (a' la Lord of the Rings -- Return of the King)?
