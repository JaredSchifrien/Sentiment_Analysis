I thought this movie was excellent. I had the pleasure of seeing it with some people who hadn't seen previews so they had no idea what was going on...but of course those of us who did see the previews pretty much had it ruined for us. But nonetheless its still a great movie with a lot of action and of course, the lame one liners...but you can't have an action without lame one liners right?
