Excellent. Masterpiece material right here. Watched it in school (took the whole day) and loved. Most kids hated it, but I found it really interestiing. I like the first half the best. The second half seemed to dull out a little but came back at the end. Many memorable scenes. And what do I say to all of you who dont like this comment. Well, frankly, I don't give a damn...
