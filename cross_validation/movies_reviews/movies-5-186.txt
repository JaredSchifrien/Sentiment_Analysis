What an amazing film! Definatly in the top five movies of all time in my book. Mel Gibson did an amazing job acting and directing. has amazing epic battle seguences and an overwhelmingly inspiring. A story of an orphan boy that was raised byb his uncle. When the horrible king longshanks comes into power he is forced to fight for something he has never had FREEDOM. His will for freedom and his hate for the king drive him towards battle and inspiror his men. A masterpiece of a film full of felt emotion. ( rated R for strong graphic violence, language; 2 f-bombs, and sexual content including nudity.)
