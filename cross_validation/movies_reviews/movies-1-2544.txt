i love kungfu movies, and i have to say jackie chan is particularly stupid. his buffonery reminds me of charlie chaplin of 100 years ago. wow, he does his own stunts. hello, thats because he can't act. oh wait, i have a remarkable idea! HE SHOULD GET AN ACTING DOUBLE. this movie, like all jackie chan movies, sucks big time.
