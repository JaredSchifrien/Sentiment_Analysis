This movie was great in the sense that it explored a war hero as he had never been explored before. Surely the commander was a good man and a great solider, but his lust for greatness and legend came over his want to fight for the cause. This was eventually his demise. I do agree with PBeavr, this isn't exactly a war movie, it's really more of a character exploration and story telling movie, and a great one at that.
