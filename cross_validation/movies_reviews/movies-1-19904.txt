For the first time I honestly didn't know who was going to be the murderer. So I'll give 'em that. But otherwise... The lines left too many question marks unanswered and you never really got into the depth of things. You could almost tell right away who was going to die and it wasn't even scary. I actually laughed when the first few people got killed. It was never really scary 'cause if you had watched the two other movies you had a pretty good idea of what is going to happen next. There was some surprising secrets but not enough.
