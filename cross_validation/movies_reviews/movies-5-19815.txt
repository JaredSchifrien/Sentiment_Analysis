maybe everybody's wondered at one time or another about that coincidence of the two 28 day cycles... one being the moon (roughly) and the other being... well, when ginger says i got the curse, you figure it out. this was a concept that nobody ever seemed to have explored in film, maybe because they were afraid it couldn't be handled tastefully enough to maintain audience interest. all i know is that i loved this movie. it was sharp, dark, well-paced, painfully real, had great fx, and never lost momentum. it amusingly uses horror to handle a normal phenomenon, just blowing it out of proportion as werewolfism, the rising of the animal influence in adult life that causes us to leave childhood innocence, and sometimes friends and siblings temporarily behind. the great thing about it is that like 'raiders of the lost ark' it can be deadly serious or just great cinematic entertainment. i strongly recommend it, the cast, producers and writers did an excellent job.
