Pure magic, that s what this movie is. i read all four books and loved the story so, i couldn t wait to see the movie. When i finally saw it, i spent most of the time delighted with the adaptation - which is very good, and with a fabulous cast that does a wonfderful job in giving life to Harry Potter and his world.
