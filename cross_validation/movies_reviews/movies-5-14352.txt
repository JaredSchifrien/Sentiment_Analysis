Have to rate this a 5 just because of Ellen Burstyn's amazing acting alone. It is quite unusual to have a movie be so thought-provoking and hopefully will be a wake-up call to some who are into drugs. I had no idea what this movie was about when I put it on and it was surprising, depressing, but very outstanding and well done.
