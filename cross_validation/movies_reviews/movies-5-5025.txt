We loved seeing this movie today. My 9 year old twins, my 11 year old daughter, my 14 year old son and myself. this was a lot of fun, I am such a fan of Antonio Banderas. The only thing that bugged me (not my kids) was that they forgot to wrap up at the ending the RESCUE of the people the whole movie was about rescuing! Oops but otherwise it was a lot of fun. I've never seen a movie with so many gadgets.
