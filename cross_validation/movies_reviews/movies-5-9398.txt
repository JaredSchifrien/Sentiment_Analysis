All conspiracy flicks have to give stylish, plausible, unexpected answers to forgotten everyday paradoxes and mysteries. Men in Black did all that and a bag of chips. Funny, smart, perfectly cast, even touching (though a bit icky-gross), this is more of a comedy of buddy cops than a Star-Trek type of sci-fi flick. I laughed so hard an alien came out of my chest.
