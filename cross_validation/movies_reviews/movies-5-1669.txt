I was distresssed to see people on this comment board who didn't like the flying of the characters. The idea that martial artists can expand their ki (Japanese name for energy ) or chi (Chinese name) and achieve magical powers is a very old myth in Asian literature and film. People who say they didn't like Lee's movie because it included Chinese legend are simply too ignorant to know what that legend is, or what the study of chi gong is, or is for. Americans can be soooo quick to judge other culture's traditions, myths and legends! The First Amendment allows Americans to say whatever the want, but doesn't protect the rest of us from people saying what they like or don't based on their ignorance....
