The movie is really well made, but not well cast...(except for Val Kilmer). Meg Ryan should not be playing Jim Morrison's wife/girlfriend. Still, by the end of the movie it was very hard for me to separate Jim Morrison from Val Kilmer. He does an excellent job. Do not watch this movie if you are in love with Jim. You'll come out despising him. Cinematically, the movie is superb.
