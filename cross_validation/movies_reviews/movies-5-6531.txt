This is a delightful film! From the sheer horror of the death in Hannay's flat, to the comic exchange where Robert Donat says For all you know I might murder a woman a week! , and chilling bit when one character holds up his truncated finger, these make up a compendium of Hitchcock touches to please his many fans.
