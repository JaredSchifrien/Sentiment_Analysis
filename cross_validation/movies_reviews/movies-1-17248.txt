My girlfriend had advance tickets thanks to a contest. I begged her not to take me. I pleaded with her not to go. We went. Ben is a killer for hire (?) who wants to seduce the lesbian-killer j-Lo (!?) in one of the worst films I have ever seen. The dialouge is god-awful. . .when Ben gets ready to perform oral sex on j-lo she says IT'S TURKEY TIME, GOBBLE, GOBBLE! I can't make this stuff up. I laughed because I had to numb the pain of sitting through this horrible movie. It's worse than WATERWORLD, ISHTAR, and even THE WEDDING PLANNER. . .I think I'll pop in TAXI DRIVER right now to remember what a decent film looks like. . .I need smelling salts right now. Anyway, Gigli is BAD!
