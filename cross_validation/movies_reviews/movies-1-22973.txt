Although the thought of passengers in space is cool, the film is boring, tedious and just plain unimaginative. Compared to the brilliance found in the various Star Trek incarnations, 2001 seems grounded in a sort of reality. Also, long portions of the film drag on without any humor, action, or dialogue. I just can't watch this film without getting sleepy.
