Independence Day isn't even a movie, it is a product. Something made to make money and make bundles of money for several different corporations. Next, this product is completly unbelievable and shallow. I could see something like this happening one day (riiiight) and I could see two doofuses like Will Smith and (I actually really like this guy) Jeff Goldblum getting an alien spaceship flying to the mother ship and takeing everything down with the help of an Apple computer laptop. This movie is made for people who like crap like Godzilla(America's Mathew Broderick version),Dante's Peak and Deep Blue Sea. All show and no blow. Completley made for product placement and a large Gross. Go see it if you like ritualistic torture. I think I'll go to my room and watch The Day The Earth Stood Still. You go have fun with your kiddie movie.
