Whenever I talk about Stigmata I always compare it to Devils Advocate by saying Devils Advocate scared the devil out of me, literally, but I still haven't figured out what Stigmata scared out of me. I originally thought that Stigmata was a movie about Devil posession, but found out that it was really about the corruption of the Catholic Church. This movie had a particular effect on me because I am Catholic, but I have always felt that their Doctrines are not in the best interest of the people, but rather those in power in the Church. Also, the movie was very scary because I believed that posession could only happen if your faith isn't strong, and Stigmata is about what happens when your faith reaches the ultimate level of where you actually begin to experience what Jesus went through in his last moments. After this movie, I feel pretty much screwed either way I go.
