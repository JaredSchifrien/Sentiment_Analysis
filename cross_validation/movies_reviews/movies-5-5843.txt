Of course, of course, of course, can we say anything about this film that hasn't been said? The revolutinary contribution that Welles made to the medium of the cinema with Citizen Kane has been widely, widely acknowledged and I concur but I think that what we are sorely lacking is discussion over just how damn fine and charismatic Welles himself was, WOW, is it just me or was the young Kane a sexy monkey or what?
