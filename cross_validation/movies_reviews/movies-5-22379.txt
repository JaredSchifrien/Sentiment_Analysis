This has got to be my favorite sci-fi horror film ever made. This is Ridley Scott's master peice of horror. I would have to say this is the best of the Alien saga. I know alot of people would beg to differ and say Aliens beats Alien. I disagree. Which is harder? To create a movie with blood, guts, explosions and machine guns with alot of marines screaming f*ck me sh*t every other line or to create a movie with blood and guts but instead of gun fire use a plot line character development and a story that actually touches on many deep seated fears. Alien is a great meditation on isolation,lose of hope and dispair. There really is no good happy message to be taken from alien. Which is almost true with alot of real life situations. The real message is damn the man. The government is working against us! They don't care who dies as long as our nation has the best weapons. Very good performances from a talented ensemble cast. Fantastic directing from master Ridley Scott. And above all one of the most enfamous movie monsters ever devised. A treat filled with jumps and chills and alot of dark sci-fi beauty. Highly Racomended. Check out the rest of the series if you get a chance. All are pretty good films by ground breaking directors.
