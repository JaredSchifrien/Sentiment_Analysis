This was a wonderful movie.It was very clean.I cried ,I laughed.It was a cute movie. With lovable characters.This movie is about Mike and skully and there monsters of course there job is to scare kids to get energy for electricity. Everyone thinks human kids are poisinous if you touch them. Then Skully finds boo(a kid).When there trying to find her door to put her back in her world Skully finds Boo is not poisonus and he grows attached to her.I would recomend it to everyone.
