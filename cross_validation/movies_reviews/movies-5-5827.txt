Orson Welles did something in this movie that had never been done before. He broke the rules. He refused to follow all filmic techniques and shot the movie how he wanted it with no regard for the people he was making it about. In this film he merciliessly bombards the pseudo-figure Charles Foster Kane with character flaws and disgrace. The real life Kane, William Randolph Hearst was none to pleased with the portrayl. The film was barred from winning any major award at the Oscars because of the contraversy surrounding it (Hearst controlled several major publications which contributed to the anti-Kane movement). The film has since been praised by critics and audiences alike for its dynamic story-telling and experimental camera work. This is truly a masterpiece of deafening beauty and elegance. Welles' perfomance as Kane seems so effortless and hsi supporting cast is marvelous. What makes this film so astonishing is that is was Welles first.
