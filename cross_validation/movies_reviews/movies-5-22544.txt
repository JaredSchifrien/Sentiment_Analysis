I don't think this one was ever topped by Batman Forever, Batman Robin, or maybe even Batman Returns. Jack Nicholson was of course perfect. Tim Burton makes an interesting film here: a comic book generally for children made into a gritty, dark, cold film with some true great action and acting. I can smile just like Nicholson's Joker. I should really buy this one. Ooh, I got a live one here!
