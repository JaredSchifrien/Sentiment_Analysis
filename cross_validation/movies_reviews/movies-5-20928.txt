Wow! You know, I wasn't sure to see this movie at first, since the reviews were very mixed. But finally I decided to rent it and give it a shot and I was just blown away! I thought the story was really good - simple enough to be on film but complex enough to be interesting. And man, I've never fallen so in love with a movie before! Love stories don't usually grab me but I was just crying like there's no tomorrow at the end of this one. I know plenty of people don't like Nicole Kidman but I find her skills dazzling every time I see her, and Ewan MacGregor's performance was breathtaking. I'm glad I got to see him in a role that finally allows him to bear his amazing talent. I'll warn you, this movie is very subjective; plenty of people didn't like it. But if you've been searching for a fiercely romantic feast for the senses that isn't your run-of-the-mill romantic drama or hum-drum romantic-comedy, then I recommend you give Moulin Rouge a try.
