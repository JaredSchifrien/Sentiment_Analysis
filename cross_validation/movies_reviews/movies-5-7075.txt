Gene Wilder as Dr. Frankenstien is almost perfect casting. Marty Feldman did a terrific job as Igor. Cloris Leachman did a wonderful job as the Maidservant Frau Buchler (did I just hear a horse whinney??). This movie was funny when it was first released, and it has aged well. There are literally hundreds of tiny jokes you miss the first time you watch, but catch with each successive showing. Defintly five stars!!!!!
