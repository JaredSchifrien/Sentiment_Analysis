This movie is definitely not for the faint of heart, but what a great movie. The movie focuses on a group of friends and the impact that Vietnam has had on their lives. Christopher Walken is incredible as a guy who just can't get over the horrors of his capture. And, Robert DeNiro and Meryl Streep give great performances, as well. This isn't your typical Vietnam movie in that it doesn't focus so much on the war itself. Instead, you gain a great understanding of how lives were absolutely ruined even for the survivors. If you're looking for light Friday night fare, this isn't the movie for you. But if you're looking to be moved, this would be a good choice.
