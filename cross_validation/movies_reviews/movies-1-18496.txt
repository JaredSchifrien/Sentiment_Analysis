Scream...what can I say. I loved it in 8th grade. I am a senior know and my likes have changed. It was an original concept and I liked it for that. It did have one good character that I could relate to. Randy. The horror movie geek. Yea I can relate to him but he is such a tiny sub character only a few movie patrons even cared about him. I cried my eyes out when I watched Scream 2. I watched Scream a couple times just for Randy. Scream is sleak and well shot. Fairly o.k. acted but not a horror movie. This is more of an action movie than anything else.If you want to be scared DON T COME ANY CLOSER. If you wish to put your brain into cruise control and watch a tediouse time filler with a few whippdey doos in it COME RIGHT IN! OH YEAH!! I almost forgot this film is what brought about teeny bopper horror! Scream loses major points for that. Horror by Hilfiger...where is my gun?
