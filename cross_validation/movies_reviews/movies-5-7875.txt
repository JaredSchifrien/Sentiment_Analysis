I laughted almost as much of this film as I cried of Forrest Gump that doesn't say little! Actually I cried half the time of Forrest Gump! I'm sure this is the funniest movie I've ever seen, even better than There's Something About Mary, American Pie Dumb Dumber! And for the people that think this movie stinks of homofobi: Haven't you understand it's ironi? The use of homofobi in this comedy is the same as in Ellen's last shows! The only different is that As Good As It Gets is even funnier, but still as important for gays' civil right. One of the best gay films ever made, though Show Me Love is better! I'm not a big Nicholson-fan, but this film is a must - his [only?] masterpiece! Both he Hunt deserved their Oscars, but the huge mistake was to give Titanic the Oscar - As Good As It Gets was better more touching! :-)
