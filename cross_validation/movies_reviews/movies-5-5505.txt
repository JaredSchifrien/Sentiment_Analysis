The master movie from the master himself - Sir Alfred. Being a lifelong movie buff, I can honestly say that no movie has caught me so off guard by its sheer jolt power. Just when you think the movie is taking you in one direction - it does a complete 180 - and does it several times. Psycho is the holy grail of all suspense/horror/thriller films. The portayal of Norman Bates by Anthony Perkins is incredible - once you see it, it's totally inconceivable that anyone else could possibly played the role. Not only my favorite horror movie, but my favorite movie of all time. If Hitchcock was Van Gogh...Psycho would be his Starry Night.
