This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. Although the plot left certain questions, that doesn't defeat the fact that it is a film that requires you to use your mind and in depth analysis. It could be a possible situation we might be faced with in the future. It also made a cinematic effect that could awe audiences for ages. br I might add that the film also provided a lot of in depth context more to the man vs. machine situation. To Philosophy for example... the Allegory of the Cave and Light by Plato could be parallelised to the situation of the Matrix to the Real World. In terms of Christian Theology, we know that Neo had come to save the world according to the Oracle. Neo means new but if you unscramble the letters it forms One . Why did they name one character Trinity ? And there is one bastard that betrayed them?... hm...
