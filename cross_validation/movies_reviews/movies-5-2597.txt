This is an awesome movie! It is so innovative and original. I haven't seen anything else like it. Some people seem to think that J Lo was bad in it, but I thought her acting was strong, and she was also very sexy in the movie. The directing was really impressive, too. The story was really good. It was pretty chilling and exciting. Also, it has really bitching visual effects! The only part of this movie that I didn't like was the intestine scene. That one was just sick, but besides that, I think this is a great movie. Its one of my favorites of 2000.
