This was so funny. Macauly Culkin was so cute in this movie. Now this is a classic movie. I loved this movie because it was so cute how he acted when he was alone- going to the store and doing the laundry. If I were alone I would just sit around and do nothing, but he is a smart kid to do what he did.
