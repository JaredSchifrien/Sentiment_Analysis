Had Don Cheadle and Sophie Okenedo been nominated for many prestigious awards would this movie have been viewed and raised awareness about whats going on not just in Rwanda, but Sierra Leone, Ethiopia and Uganda? I don't think so. The BBC was the only channel in the world that covered what was going on and to me thats simply not enough, theres more value on human life than people think its just a pity an independent movie is showing people whats going on in the world.
