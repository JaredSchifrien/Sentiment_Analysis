i'm rating this movie just because it was cool, and i want to attach my name to it somehow. everyone you've ever seen who wears black all the time will love this movie forever, because it is a forum for for hideous, fascist, dehumanizing behaviors... which all stop in the end! yes! did i mention that? good prevails! okay, then. like 'strange days', this movie is based on the false premise that memories can be implanted in human minds. nonetheless, its value as fantasy escapism is unparalleled, as is its imagery and directorial finesse. also, jennifer connely is easy on the eyes.
