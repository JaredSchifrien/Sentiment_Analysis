This is the worst scary movie I have ever seen. It was way over-hyped, with reports that grown men were leaving the theaters with heart attacks and you couldn't sleep without a light on for weeks...well, these stories had to be fake because this was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Too much talking and angry screaming...not to mention the over-use of the F-Word ...I mean, cussing is okay, to some extent, but when you hear it used every other word in a movie it gets tiresome. The whole witch thing seemed very unrealistic. I couldn't buy the idea that a witch was following the group, but the events that happened to the group seemed more like the work of local pranksters, which made the movie very, very un-scary. The ending was terrible. It was confusing and left me with a feeling of unsatisfaction. And the stupid camera movement makes you really sick to your stomach. It gave me a headache after a while. Don't waste your time with this movie...it's not worth the money and the hour and a half of your life it takes to watch it.
