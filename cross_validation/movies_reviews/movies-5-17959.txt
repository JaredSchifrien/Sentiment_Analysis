What a powerful film. The handeling of this very strong religiouse subject matter was done with impecable taste. This movie takes its self seriously through and through. A believable modern fable of love,possesion,faith and loss of,family,the horrors that dwell deep within each and every one of us. This movie will chill even the most unchillable to the core. This isn't the kind of scary most teeny boppers are used to. To tell you the truth it might and quit probably wouldn't scare them at all. This is a horror movie for those of us who take the time to feel. To realize how completely vulnerable we actually are. DO NOT SEE THE NEW VERSION ! Make sure to see the original version with the good ending. The ending that fits. That leaves it up to the audience to decide if evil concord good or if it is the other way around? THE horror classic. If only our horror directors today would take a viewing of this, sit back and realize the storytelling,character developement and atmosphere make great movies not blood, guts, tits and ass. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. IF YOU ARE A TRUE HORROR FAN OR MOVIE FAN IN GENERAL AND HAVEN'T SEEN THIS TRUELY REMARKABLE FILM DO YOURSELF A FAVOR! SEE IT!
