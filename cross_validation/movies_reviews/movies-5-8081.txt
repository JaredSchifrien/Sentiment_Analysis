I would consider this an action movie as much as a comedy movie, but, either way, it is absolutely great and Eddie Murphy's finest performance. You had to love the Axel Foley laugh and the soundtrack is vintage 80s. Unfortunately, it seemed like Murphy lost his edge after this movie and wasn't funny again until Nutty Professor (although BHC2 was pretty good).
