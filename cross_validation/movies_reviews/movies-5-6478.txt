Bruno Antony is without a doubt Alfred Hitchock's best and most sinister villian. Played brilliantly and to perfection by Robert Walker who played Bruno with the right amount of charm, sardonic humor and evil. The story of Strangers on a Train is one of Hitchcock's best and is a brilliant one. Two men meet on a train and talk casually about swapping murders so they would not have a motiv. One decides to take it seriously. Hitchcock keeps the suspense to the end. It's a must see for any Hitchcock fan.
