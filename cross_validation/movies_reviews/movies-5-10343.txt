I had no idea what this film was about when I went to see it and I was pleasantly surprised. It was very humourous and enjoyable to watch and Jack Nicholson was perfect in the lead role. I have to say that it was incredibly refreshing to see an older male actor playing a role that reflects his age...someone who's married to an older woman his own age, who's retiring and dealing with being a senior citizen basically. The narration in the film is brilliant, because it's constructed through letters which the character writes to Ndugu, the child he sponsers through world vision. Those letter provide the funniest moments in the entire film...I was practically choking with laughter at some of the things he writes.
