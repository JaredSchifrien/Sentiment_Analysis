Tremendous film, well worth its reputation. Great script, great performances, intelligent, serious film. Wouldn't make much of an impression of most of the clods in America during this post-literate era we're living in, basically because it wouldn't be likely that a video game tie-in could be established. Also, no special effects. And Reese Witherspoon, Tom Cruise, Ben-Wa Affleck and none of the other two dozen or so no-talents on the Hollywood round robin are in the cast.
