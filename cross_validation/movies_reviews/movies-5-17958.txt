What a thoroughly brilliant and creepy movie. It's rare that I find a movie in which I can become totally engrossed. The Exorcist definently held my attention. The occult in itself has always, in some way, interested me and the way it was portrayed here was simply fascinating. There was this unexpected mix of unadulterated fright and an eerie sort of thoughtfulness that held me silent at the movie's end. Thoughtfulness, you say? How so? Well, one can't really ignore the powerful and symbolic image of this young girl, once so innocent and in a way unaffected by the outside goings-on of the world, being so overcome with pure and complete evil. Evil that that was so powerful she seethed with it(due in part, im sure, to a wonderful performance by Linda Blair), had it flowing through every self inflicted cut, every slow and purposeful outake of breath.The beginning was slow, but I believe that too was very well executed. In those early moments, one is filled with a wonderful sense of suspense.
