The finest acting in the oughts (2000 to 2004) so far---the Academy shamefully overlooked Ellen Burnstyn. Her performance is the heart of this incredible or difficult film. You will not believe your eyes when you see what she goes through. Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans (appearing in his first dramatic role) are equally believable in this anti-drug film that does not glamorize its subject matter in the least. And it's brilliantly directed--you feel as if you are on the drugs with the characters, because of this direction. A perfect film.
