I can't give this movie more than 1 star because while I'm glad I saw it once, just so I could say I saw it, I wouldn't want to sit through it again. The whole premise of the movie was stupid to me: I thought it was overstyled and way too ostentatious (tried way too hard to be cool). Examples include those stupid gloves that the agents would wear when they were going through the electronic files, waving their arms dramatically in the air. Lame. Why not just have a futuristic mouse pointer? Or just one glove? Because Spielberg had to make it dramatic and make it look cool. Would've been way cooler if you didn't need gloves to operate the thing, or, better yet, if you didn't even have to move to operate it. On another note, keeping the three psychic folks floating in a pool of ectoplasmic milk was just too hokey to be believed. Also, I think there were some scenes in the movie that Spielberg made gratuitously gross just so the movie got under your skin . But I didn't pay $7.50 to see spraying vomit, bloody eyeballs and rotten sandwiches. I paid to see a cool, futuristic, thought-provoking movie. And I sure as hell didn't get what I paid for. Apparently, since Stanley Kubrick died, Steven Spielberg has been suffering from delusions that he's Kubrick reincarnated. I wish some of his inner circle would pull him aside and tell him that we don't need another Kubrick, or, at the very least, if he's going to try to mimic Kubrick in his movies he needs to avoid the gross-out factor - a movie can be dark, funny and disturbing without the gratuitous vomit shots.
