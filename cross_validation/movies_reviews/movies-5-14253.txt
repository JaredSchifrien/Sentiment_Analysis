Tom hanks is great as a lawyer who has AIDS He hides it as long as he can until the symptoms become more obvious, when his lawfirm finds out they fire him. He hires a lawyer well played by Denzel Washington to defend him.Shows the prejudice and ignorance those have against people who have AIDS. Very well done movie. and a tear jerker at times.
