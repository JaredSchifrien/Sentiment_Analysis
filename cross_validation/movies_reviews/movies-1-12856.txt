What happens when you send 16 beer-drinking teens to Mexico? You have The Real Cancun, possibly the worst film in years. I was hoping for something along the lines of The Real World , in which we have interesting characters, but just an extended storyline, with some nudity and sex. Instead, we just get a bunch of drunk teens, with a tiny bit of nudity. This makes Jackass look like a masterpiece.
