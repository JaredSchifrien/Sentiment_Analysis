 I was born... a poor black child. Thus begins this brilliant comedy that I've only seen once but I definitely believe is one of the funniest I've ever come across. Bernadette Peters' appearance is great and Steve Martin is wonderfully goofy. It's hard to pick a favorite scene, whether it's Steve and Bernadette singing Tonight You Belong To Me or Steve Martin singing her a song he wrote about a thermos, it's all great.
