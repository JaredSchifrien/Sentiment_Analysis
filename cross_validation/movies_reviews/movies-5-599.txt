This is a first rate film noir thriller. Gabriel Byrne shines as Dean Keaton, an ex-cop turned crook turned reformed businessman and Kevin Spacey is absolutely convincing as Verbal Kint. The story is engaging and brilliant. The ending will leave you in slack jawed as you rewind the tape to immediately see it again and again.
