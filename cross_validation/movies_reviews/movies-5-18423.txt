This is a classic. Every scene is well crafted drama working in both suspense and shock. The acting is excellent, most notably the anguished Gregory Peck and a frantic David Warner. An eerie soundtrack too. All cyliders were firing in the production of this one. The rest of the series declines with each sequel, but their failures shouldn't diminish the appreciation of this one.
