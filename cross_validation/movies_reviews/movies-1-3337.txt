Sorry, I hated this film. It was very loud, brutal, violent, and WAY too long. The movie ended after an hour, then ended 45 minutes later, then ran out of steam FINALLY after about three and a half hours. As Roger Ebert once said, you can tell a movie is bad when you look at your watch. Then look at it again. Then shake it to see if it's stopped. I would go on about historical inaccuracies.... This movie couldn't seem to find a time setting. There were Native Americans doing MARTIAL ARTS. And the Wolf itself, some kind of giant [badly done] CGI badger with armor obscuring you from seeing it (when you finally do see it, they use the standard hiding the monster bit for most of the film). If I had to say anything, the photography, settings, and costumes were beautiful. But when the only way you can validate a film is the costumes, you know the plot and chaarcters are lacking. I was completely surprised. I expected a sensible, well-done French Film. What I got was a nonsensical American-style blockbuster.
