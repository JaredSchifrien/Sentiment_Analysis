I find myself watching this film every single time that it is on TV and enjoying it each time. Maybe that makes me Swayze crazy, but if the shoe fits... Everyone agrees that Swayze and Grey are both really good, but Jerry Ohrbach is also great as Baby's father who is struggling with some of the decisions made by his younger daughter. Strong soundtrack, as well, even the song sung by Swayze himself.
