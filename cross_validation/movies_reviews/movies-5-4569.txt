What a sweet movie. A pig named BAbe who end up herding sheep. We hear the voices of the farm animals, BAbe is a sweet polite pig who makes friends with the other animal. One of the funniest scenes is with Ferdinand , who wants to get BAbe to steal the alarm clock in the farmers house. What happens is hilarious. A good family movie. VEry well done.EAsy for the adults to watch too.
