This flick should be shown to any kid that can play a lil ball, who thinks he's strolling to stardom. Keep 'em humble/keep the odds in perspective. As far as the flick itself - it's great. Did not want it to end. I wanted to keep following them after their high school days. I thought Arthur had more potential as far as skill, but was more raw. A little polish and he could've been awesome. Of course he never had the chance though.
