This may be the best movie I ve seen all year and I m certain it s one of the best roles of Kevin Kline s career. First the superfluous stuff; gorgeous sets and locations as well as good costumes and a believable trip in the Wayback Machine to the 1970 s even though, we re talking boarding school uniforms and not the flashy, trashy polyester clothing from that era that those of us who remember it all grew to loath (you guys know who you are because you are also probably the only ones who got the Wayback Machine reference). Now, for the more heady aspects of the film - this is obviously one of the better-written and well-directed films to come along in a great while in addition to being one of the more moving and meaningful. It managed to address the often forgotten subject of ethics and in a very straightforward, intelligent and very basic way. As to acting and the aforementioned great job by Kevin Kline I will say this; he managed to convey with mere facial expressions what some actors could not with volumes of verbiage. I m convinced he s one of the best talents we have in the seasoned actors category. Emperor s Club was well worth the price of admission as well as the price of a rental a few months from now.
