A lot of people really hate this movie. I personally love it. I think astrophysics is really cool. This was released in 1997 when everyone was crazy about aliens. The motif isn't as popular now, so it may not be so appealing, but it's still a great movie. Jodie Foster does an excellent job. The film explores galactic communication through matehmatical signals, possible space travel, and the conflict between science and religion. It's entertaining and very well-made, and it really causes the viewer to reflect on what he or she really believes, as some things are open to interpretation. I'd say this is a must-see.
