I'm glad this movie was made. It's a slice of real life whether you like it or not. Homosexuality has been around since the beginning of time--it's not going away folks. Instead of constantly persecuting these people, maybe it's time to try and understand them. I think this movie is a small step in the right direction. I think all the "Brokebutt" comments are so juvenile and ignorant. People need to grow-up. Maybe it's time we focus on more pressing issues that are really affecting society. I really have a problem with my tax dollars being used to raise the children of people who are too stupid or lazy to practice birth control.
