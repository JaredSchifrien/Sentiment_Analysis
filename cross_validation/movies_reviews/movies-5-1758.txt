It has been a long time since I have seen a very well worked and original style of storytelling in a feature film. This film is simply incredible. It manages to be very mysterious,well acted,bravely and honestly directed,humorous and above all gripping. This film sucks you in and refuses to let go. You cannot leave the theater. I had to pee to the point I almost passed out and I still could not tear myself away from this ingeniouse tail. The story is told backward. That is from the last event to the first. What we know is that our main character's, played by Guy Peirce, wife has been raped and murdered and he is out for revenge. Sounds rather run of the mill,right? Well, he witnesses this happen, tries to rescue his wife and gets a severe blow to the head which leaves him with a very strange psychological disorder. He has no short term memory. He has all his old memories he just cannot make any new ones. He most take polaroid pictures and scroll noted in the form of tattos all over his body so that he might track down and kill his wifes murderer. This is what gives this film such a wonderfully twisted and remarkable edge. I haven't seen something told this cool since,dare I say, forever? This has made my list of the top films of 2001. Memento is a profound and breakthrough film. Something that should be considered classic. Anyone who enjoys the art of film and story telling should treat themselves to this astonishing work of art. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
