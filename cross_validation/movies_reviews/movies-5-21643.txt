Truly spectacular. I'm not one of these Tolkien fanatics that knows the whole story, so this movie was kind of a first for me. The cast was excellent and you develop a respect for each member of The Fellowship. Many of the villains are somewhat atypical bad-guys, but it all fits in well. Frodo and the gang are fighting something much more powerful than they would be expected to handle, and it is unsettling to watch, but it's truly an epic story. The special effects are breathtaking, the movie is just so... colossal. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that this is the greatest film to ever grace my eyes and ears. I've never encountered something quite like it. Can't wait for the next one!
