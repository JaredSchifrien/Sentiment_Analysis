Story-wise, my expectations of this movie somewhat exceeded what I saw today. In spite of that, I still think this is a very well done piece of work. Malkovich was, well, Malkovich - always a surreal and compelling experience. His character Murnau's dissent into madness was complete and he did a fine job conveying that. Before this movie, my only means of judging Eddie Izzard s talents was by his wonderful standup routine which is so good that I am led to believe he was somewhat underused in this part. But he did very well in spite of it and I hope to see him on the big screen again. There are no words to adequately describe the depth of depravity and debased horror that Willem Dafoe was able to capture and instill in his Nosferatu. Of all the depictions of vampires I have seen in movies over the years and there have been many - Dafoe's is the most bone chillingly horrifying. He truly deserves the highest recognition for his work in this film. In addition, the photography was very creative, the costumes realistic and true to 1921, and the makeup was phenomenal. I hope they get the nominations and wins they deserve on Oscar night.
