I have not seen a film this terrible since I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. This film is horrid. Absolutly terrible. The spoofing makes no sense and it way too fixated on placing sh*t on people. Whether it is talking about pooping on someone for sexual plaeasur or actually exploding gallons of fresh sh*t all over people. Where does all the sh*t come from? This was never in The Breakfast Club or She's All That. I felt like I had flushed my hard earned bucks down the toilet and then had it explode all over me with sh*t. The only true moment of comedy comes with...jesus....there are no funny moments. I had to force my laughter each time something was supposed to be comical. What a waste of a good genre to spoof.
