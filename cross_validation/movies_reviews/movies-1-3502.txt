after that dumb movie came out all these riceburner 4 bangers started buzzing up and down the street with their in reality slow cars zigging in n out of traffic. The only good car was the charger n they trashed it.american v8s are a lot cheaper n faster right off the bat ask any mechanic.its just a trend making movie. lots of people escepially girls that dont know anything about cars will flock to it with the shiny head n taillights(not all girls but alot). its really a stupid movie though the things they say in the movie are not factual at all. the second one is probly going to be dumber except for the camaro which i hope they dont trash. i havent seen it yet so miracles can happen.
