I really enjoyed Rocky Horror Picture Show. It's definitely not for people who are very conservative. It had everything from transexuals, homosexuals, adultery, and such. This movie is a nice mixture of comedy and music. The songs are totally off the wall and very entertaining. Rocky Horror Picture Show is a major no brainer movie that I would recommend to anybody.
