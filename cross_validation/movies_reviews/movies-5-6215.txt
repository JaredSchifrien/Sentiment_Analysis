Excellent film noir, one of the best ever made. Great script and terrific performances by Joseph Cotten, Vali, Trevor Howard and especially Orson Welles. The cinematography gives the right mood, and no way could this movie have been made years later in color. The zither music is unique, unfortgettable but fitting.
