When this film was first released, it had the christian community in an uproar as they though it was defiling Jesus' name. On a chatshow, John Cleese and Michael Palin had a war of words against one of the ministers - something any Python fan should watch. The film itself is highly entertaining and carries on with the sense of humour that is present in all the Python work. My favourite line has to be 'He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy'. Me and my fiance have all the Python films because we adore them so much!
