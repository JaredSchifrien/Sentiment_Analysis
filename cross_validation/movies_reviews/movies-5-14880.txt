 In The Bedroom is one of the most powerful films of the year! Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek are superb! Merisa Tomei is excellent and the rest of the cast is sublime! The storyline is a bit predictable, yetthat is not the point of the film; this movie shows how one act of violence can tear a family to shreds. This is a very quiet and disturbing, and i litteraly mean QUIET! There are many scenes in the film that show a character doing something with no speech. There is one disturbing scene where Spacek is sitting on the couch smoking a ciggarett and staring at the tv screen with this look of shock. its a disturbing scene! All and all an A+ movie! Note: the film is VERY realistic, making it all that much freaky and sad.
