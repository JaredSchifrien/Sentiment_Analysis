Please, for a minute, forget the fact that the villain is a tooth fairy. When you watch how the directors portrayed this vile snatch of a beast, it is amazing. The first five-ten minutes exhibited the opitamy of setting a dark mood.Moving from a bloody mouth due to a freshly yanked tooth, to a slow, musicless scene of youthful sympathy, and straight a howling, child eating whore in black, screaming and banging on surrounding walls. The wraith was always shrouded in darkness, and expelled hideous shreiks and moans. You never know where she could be hiding. I've noticed how easy it was for the main character to evade the wench, but think about it, he's been running from her for 30-something years. The fool's gotta be good at it! I gave this movie 5 stars because the rest of you not-knowing-a-damn-thing-about-horror-flicks-even-if-you-were-gang-raped-by-Freddy-Jason-3 zombies-and the tooth fairy gave it a shabby rep. Oh yeah...The acting really sucked. Uh...so did the ending.
