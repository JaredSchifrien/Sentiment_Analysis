I loved reading the book as a child, and now my kids adore the movie. The unlikely relationship between a pig and a talking spider was quirky and endearing. I suppose it could be a metaphor for many relationships in life..however I don't need to get that deep. It is a fun movie for kids that touches on friendship, love and loss.
