Adaptation is the only movie of this past Christmas season that actually lived up to its promise. DO NOT listen to the critics who will tell you it's gimmicky or that it tries too hard to be post postmodern or even worse -- much much much worse -- that it unravels and falls apart at the end. These critics were not paying attention! When you're watching Adaptation you become aware that the movie seems to be alive and growing and making itself up as the film runs through the projector. Seeing the interplay between the things that happen to our hero, the things he learns and experiences, and how those things affect this script that got made into this movie that you're watching... it's thrilling. Nothing less than thrilling. All movies should be this original and entertaining and -- dare I say it -- deep! Don't skip this one. Skip Gangs of New York, but not Adaptation!
