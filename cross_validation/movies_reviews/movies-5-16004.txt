truly this is one of the most devastatingly effective films ive ever seen.When i left bthe theater i was trembling and crying like a baby. lars von teir has created a materpeice and a new saint for our times in Selma(expertly acted by BJORK),a woman who is losing her sight as she works in a factory to save money so har son can have surgery and not go blind.catherine deneuve co stars as selmas best friend.This film is scarier than any horror film i have ever seen.and more emotional than any film i have ever seen. if i could give it ten stars i would.i almost forgot to tell you abou the musical numbers...oh well go see for yourself.
