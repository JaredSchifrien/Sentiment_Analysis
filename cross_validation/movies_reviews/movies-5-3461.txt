Lethal Weapon 3 was in my opinion the best of the four films. I have to admire the filmmakers, who integrated drama with action quite effectively in the film. Glover and Gibson are solid as usual, and their on-screen chemistry is still strong. Pesci provides some comic relief along the way, and Rene Russo is a fine addition to the series. With Glover's character somewhat disengaged after he discovers that he shot one of his son's friends in a drug bust, Russo and Gibson take over and have such amazing (and amusing) chemistry on screen. Overall, Lethal Weapon 3 was a fantastic addition the series, bringing us exciting, dramatic and comedic moments all within two hours.
