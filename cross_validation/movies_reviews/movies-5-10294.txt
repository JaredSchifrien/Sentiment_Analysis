This is probably the first comedy I have seen in theatres this year that was actually worth watching. It was great ! I laughed all the way thru this one. Queen Latifah is exactly as she is called in this movie..she is the one and only COCOA GODDESS. She definately stood out in this movie ! As for Steve Martin, I never loved him or anything, and he is definately showing his age in this one. But regardless, the movie was hilarious and I can't wait to buy it on DVD.
