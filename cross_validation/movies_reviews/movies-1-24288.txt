My opinion, to like this movie, you have to take the blue pill. Revolutions is better then Reloaded. That sets the bar at about ground-- level. With ROCKY II, Aliens, Terminator 2, God Father II, as examples of sequels worthy of the originals;lets reset the bar.Pretend Revolutions directly follows The Matrix. Now do some Keanu math: High expectations [(Empty digital spectacle + meaningless characters) gutted original characters] x Stupefying Wizard of Oz plot turns =REVOLUTION IS BOGUS DUDE!!
