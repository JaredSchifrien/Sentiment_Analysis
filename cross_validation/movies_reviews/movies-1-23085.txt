Star Wars: The Phantom Meanace is the first of the new trilogy that George Lucas has come out with. It is in fact a badly made film with annoying characters and no plot or storyline whatsoever. The acting was terrible, and you can't ask an 8-year old boy to take the role of a role that a 30-year old man took 25 years ago.
