A fantastic movie; side splittingly funny at times, romantic, poignant. It plays on the rabbi/priest stereotypes with humour but sensitivity. The happy ending is of course not unexpected but the film sets out to end on a happy note, friendship prevails. A strong directing debut from Edward Norton, one of the most talented actors around today, and he, Jenna Elfman and Ben Stiller are all very believable in their roles. A great movie.
