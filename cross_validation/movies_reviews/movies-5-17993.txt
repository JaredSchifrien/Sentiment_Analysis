yeah, this movie is starting to look dated, but when it gets started it will shock u and gross u out like a horror movie should ! The grand-daddy of em all ! If u are looking for a cheap slasher film that jolts u with silly, gory F/X, don't bother watching this one. If u want an intelligent, mature horror film that gets kinda deep, check it out. For everyone that has uttered this line, I watched it and it didn't scare me at all , forget all the tremendous hype spoken about this film and rewatch it. Judge it then, you might change your opinion. If u still prefer FRiday the 13th, well.....today is a perfect day for an Exorcism....
