I am an action movie freak. This movie was packed with action. I was on the edge of my seat all the time. I fell in love with Jet Li, who was also in Lethal Weapon 4. He's a great martial artist. Aaliyah was superub for her first acting gig. Everything was great about this movie, from the storyline to the dialogue.
