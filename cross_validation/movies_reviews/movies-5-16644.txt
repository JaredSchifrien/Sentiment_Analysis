Salma Hayek pushed for years to get this bio-pic made and I thank God she did. Easily one of my favorite movies of all time and I usually hate bio-pics. To see the way this movie was pulled off was amazing. The story of an artists rise to fame but more about the hardships she endured during her life. Compelling stuff and worth the time. Expand your mind and watch it. You will not be dissappointed.
