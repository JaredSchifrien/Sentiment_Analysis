A work of genius, one of the most brilliant black comedies ever made. I always laugh out loud at the airplanes getting it on in the opening scene. Next time you watch it, consider that Dr. Strangelove (who I always assumed to be Edward Teller) might actually be Henry Kissinger (unlikely, because HK was still relatively obscure in 1964--but the resemblance is disturbing indeed).
