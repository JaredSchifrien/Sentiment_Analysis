I didn't see this until the dvd came out. I wish I had seen it in the theatre because it is one of my all time favorites. A lot of people didn't get the humor, but I did, and I laughed out loud on quite a few occasions. Some people have to have their comedies hit them in the face like a sledgehammer in order to get them, but this one doesn't do that, and that's what I like about it.
