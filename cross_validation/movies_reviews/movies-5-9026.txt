Cusack at his best! This movie should be in the top 5 hands down. It is a different type of comedy but that's what makes it so outstanding. If you walk up to anybody who has seen it and declare Two dollars, I want my two dollars you are guaranteed a laugh. Along with Howard Cosell wannabe race car drivers and a loveable French girl this movie has it all. My grandmother dropped acid and highjacked a school bus full of penguins. Dammit that's brilliant!!
