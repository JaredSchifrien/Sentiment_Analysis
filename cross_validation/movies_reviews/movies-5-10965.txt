This movie is one of the best I've ever seen and I could watch it many times. Kathy Bates stars at an ordinary housewife, whose life centers on her family and a fantasy. She wants to be a singer. Did you know Kathy Bates has a beautiful voice? I was shocked! She adores a British singer played by Jonathan Pryce. Just as she is about to get tickets to see her idol in person, her husband (Dan Aykroyd) gives her the news that he wants a divorce. This film is part musical, mostly comedy, part mystery and drama. It takes Fox's death to teach Grace (Kathy) how to to live: A life lived in fear isn't much fun. Grace's love is unusual because she gives it without demands. She accepted her daughter-in-law, who is a dwarf and named Grace's only grandchild Pokey. Grace never condemns and still loves everyone. This is a quirky, bizarre, very funny comedy. Grace eventually learns that there is more to life than being safe. We are prompted at the end to love unconditionally our family and friends, plus ourselves. That takes courage, but this film makes it work. The songs are fabulous and you can't help but keep singing them after the movie is over. Special guest cameo by Julie Andrews is another treat; she plays herself and sings too. There are many other cameos, like Barry Manilow and Lynn Redgrave. Highly recommend you go rent this movie today!!
