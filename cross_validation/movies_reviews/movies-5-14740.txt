This is a very fast-paced, interesting movie. While the subject matter may be somewhat serious, it still ends up being a feel-good movie in the end. The story has a few interesting twists, and the exploration of the protagonist's family life is quite uncommon. Julia Roberts is fantastic as Erin and she should be nominated for an Academy Award.
