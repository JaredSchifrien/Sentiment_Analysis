A labour of love for Kevin Spacey. The film hops between the genres of bio-pic and musical, with flashbacks into the subconscious of the main character in a way that is a little scattered. But I don't think it harms the telling of a good story or the examination of the character of the driven and charismatic Bobby Darin. And Kevin Spacey looks like he is having a pure ball when he's singing Darin's songs.
