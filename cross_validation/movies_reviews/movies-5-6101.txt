This sequel,in which Dr Frankenstein resuscitates the monster and creates a (less than enraptured)mate for him, is even better than the landmark original- a tirelessly inventive visual feast full of atmosphere,macabre wit,expressionist lighting,and spiced with a touch of poetry and pathos.It puts most modern horror films to shame.Incidentally,Boris Karloff,who played the monster,was a dignified,old-fashioned English gentleman,while the underrated director James Whale is portrayed in the recent,much admired Gods and Monsters .
