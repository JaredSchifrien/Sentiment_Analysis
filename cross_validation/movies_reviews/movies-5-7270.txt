Except for Animal House (and maybe Airplane), no comedy movie has begat more catch-phrases (e.g. - It's in the hole!!! Noonan, Noonan) than Caddyshack. From start to finish, this movie serves up laughs on something that is hard to make fun of -- the urbane sport of golf. While Dangerfield, Chevy Chase, and Bill Murray delivered some of their greatest comedic work in a movie, Ted Knight earns medalist honors as the outrageous Judge Schmails. I dug the primitive animotronic gopher. While dancing with a girl in Newport Rhode Island, she commented that I danced like the gopher. Needless to say, I did not score that night. If you have never seen Caddyshack, you are missing out on one of the great pleasures in life. P.S. - For the Ladyshark, that was a Baby Ruth...mistaken for a u-know-what.
