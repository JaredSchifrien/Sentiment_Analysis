We already knew the plot before we ever watched this movie, so what they did was to make the part of the lawman more important, and play up the interaction between Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. The casting in this movie is great, they could not have chosen a better US Marshal than the big dog Tommy Lee Jones. He is fair, he is relentless, and, little by little, he becomes sympathetic. We knew the plot, but they still manage a few surprises along the way.
