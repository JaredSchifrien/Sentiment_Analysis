This is a very great movie. Reese Witherspoon is stunning. Both her and Phoenix do a remarkable cover of Cash's songs. You don't need to know anything about Cash to appreciate his story. He's got a whirlwind of problems, drugs, women, the whole bit, but his life eventually revolves around his touring partner and future wife June Carter (Witherspoon). She basically saved him from self-destruction.
