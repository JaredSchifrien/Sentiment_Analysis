Took the family to see Shrek last weekend; what a great family movie. The producers and writers really did a good job of combining some adult level thinking with a child targeted story line that kept us all interested and laughing. There are lots of jabs at Disney and others that make some of the adult humor clean and enjoyable. I m not a big Eddie Murphy or Myers fan but thought they did an excellent job of vocally creating their characters. There are a few unnecessary words here and there but they seemed to pasts quicker than the kids could pick up. I would highly recommend the movie for any family outing. Hats off to DreamWorks for a job well done.
