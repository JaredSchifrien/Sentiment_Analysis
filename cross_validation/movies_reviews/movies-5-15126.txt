This movie just kind of came and went, and nobody seems to have talked about it much. I'm surprised, because it was one of the more original and entertaining movies I've seen since American Beauty. I'm not saying it was a ground-breaking motion picture by any means, but the characters had depth, the story wasn't predictable, and the quality of the acting was high. I'll tell you what - if you didn't see it in the theater, and one night you're in the mood for a good, quirky rental, Wonder Boys is a great call.
