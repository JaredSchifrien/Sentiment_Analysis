I just watched this movie last night. Way too much hype; even my friend at Blockbuster recommended it to me. I watched the little girl that was in the movie on Fox in the Morning and even she laughed when the interviewer seemed surprised that her mom let her watch it because it was supposed to be so scary. I may be in the minority here, but I have to agree with Axelrod2003. Can someone tell me where the scary part was? I also agree with BigBaby. The ending totally sucked. Too many unanswered questions and pieces that didn't fit together. It seemed as though the director had several ideas going at once and couldn't decide which direction to go. A very sad disappointment but if you want to watch it just to say you watched it, go for it. It is your money.
