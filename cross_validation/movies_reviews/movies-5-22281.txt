I love the Jurassic Park movies! I just really enjoy the superb action, the wonderful effects, and the beautiful music that goes along with it. It's not for everyone, but it's definitely for me! I can't wait until the fourth movie comes out. It was suppsed to be out already, but they haven't started filming, they don't know who the director will be, and they don't even know the storyline yet! Well, anyways the new date for #4 is supposedly Summer, 2006 in case you want to know. Go Jurassic Park! :)
