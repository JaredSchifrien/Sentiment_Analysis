Nicholson at his best. Jack Nicholson plays Jack Nicholson playing a hardcore USMA Colonel heading up the base at Guantanamo Bay. Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise playing a cocky, young military defense attorney. Kiefer Sutherland as Nicholson's conniving Lieutenant portrays the slimeball accomplice perfectly, and Kevin Bacon as the JAGcorps DA gets that part to a tee. Combine all of that with splendid direction by Rob Reiner and you've got the best courtroom drama since Inherit the Wind. Oscars? No. They don't give Oscars to movies that make you feel good about the military. But, after 9-11, maybe they should reconsider.
