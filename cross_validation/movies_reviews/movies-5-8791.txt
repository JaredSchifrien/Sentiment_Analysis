I thought this movie was hilarious. It's not a film where the jokes are obvious or over the top. The humor is low-key and dry and the actors all seem to be having a good time creating their characters. Fred Willard is a standout as the emcee who knows nothing about dogs or dog shows, but loves to keep talking anyway. I laughed and laughed while watching this.
