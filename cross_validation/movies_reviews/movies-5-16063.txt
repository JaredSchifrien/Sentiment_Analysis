This movie was astounding. The acting was exemplary both by Denzel Washington and James Woods, as well as the rest of the cast. The film brought on a great sense of suspense, keeping me on the edge of my seat until the very end (my favorite suspenseful scene is when John Q. is about to kill himself). This film really makes me disappointed in the American Health Care System itself. In the final analysis, another great performance by Denzel Washington, quite possibly the most diverse actor out there.
