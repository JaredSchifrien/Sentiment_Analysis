I think this is a great movie. Although I prefer The Lion King, it's still a beautiful tale of a puppet who wants to be a real boy. Didn't think much of the live action one that was made recently though. Some good songs, it's a classic. I didn't know it was so old, but then again Snow White And The Seven Dwarves and Peter Pan are really old too. Summary: A BEAUTIFUL HEART-WARMING TALE OF A PUPPET WHO WANTS TO BE A REAL BOY.
