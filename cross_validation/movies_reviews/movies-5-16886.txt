Lost Highway is a film that all filmakers wish they could make. But sadly, most filmakers don't have the talent that David Lynch has in his pinky finger. This dark film noir is a masterpiece. This movie was made to open minds, to inspire thought and feeling and it accomplishes that very well. Every person who watches it takes something different out of it. What I take is that life is like a Lost Highway. Going in different directions to different conclusions. Fred Madison's guilt over killing his wife (which he doesn't even remember..he sees himself brutally doing so on a tape sent to his home.) so overtakes him that he becomes someone else. Or he at least halluncinates that he does. Two sides of a road. Redemption and Guilt, Suffering and Release. But more than that, it shows to look beneath the surface (much like Lynch did in Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks). He Showed things aren't always as they may seem beautfully with the Man In Black in the masterful party scene in which the aformentioned Man tells Fred that he is at Fred's home..When Fred scoffs, he is then told to call his home and finds the man answering...this scene is brilliant for so many reasons..When I first saw it I rewound it and watched it again..just to try to fully comprehend it. But Lynch's work really isn't there to be comprehended. It's there to be experienced and felt. Many elements are present in this film to be taken in and understood upon repeat viewings..And considering how I've only seen this movie twice, I'm sure I miss a lot. But what I have seen and what I have understood I've thought amazing. But Lynch is amazing..Everything he's ever done is amazing. See this movie. Look beneath the surface.
