Wow, what an awful movie. I mean really, really miserable. As shallow as this sounds, I rented From Dusk Till Dawn because the ads featured Salma Hayek dancing around scantily clad, and it turns out that was the only part of this movie worth watching. The plot is idiotic, the acting is worse than what you'd expect from bad TV, it's not at all scary, and the attempts at humor fall completely flat. If this movie was any worse, I could almost recommend it as something to laugh at, but it's not even bad enough to be good.
