deserves more stars than five. this is a classic and because of it's setting it's also timless(like star wars) this was the first film that showed ford cuold be much more than han solo.(and to think tom selleck was offered the role first)might have seemed good then would seem really bad now. my favorite part of this film is when ark is being transported on the ship inside the crate with the nazi swastika on it , suddenly the hateful symbol begins to slowly burn and is totally comsumed by holy fire awsome scene hinting at the ultimate power of God.
