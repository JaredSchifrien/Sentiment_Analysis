Not only is this a great movie for children, it's a great movie for adults. I'm not much of a dog lover, but I was very moved by this story of an outgoing Jack Russell terrier who befriends a shy little boy. This dog was all heart. I advise anyone who has not seen it to have plenty of tissues handy. It's not a grim or depressing movie, but it is a tear-jerker.
