Clockwork Orange was the first British cast movie I'd seen and it was so crazy to me. If I was a kind of person that did drugs like LSD and acid and stuff, I'd watch it all the time. Every event that happens in it is wild, like when they broke into that old couple's home, and when the main guy reformed and went back to that same home to try to live there.
