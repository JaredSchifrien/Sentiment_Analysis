I'd have to say that this could be the best horror movie of all time. I love the whole Michel Myers thing. This is a classic. I havn't seen a really good horror film in a while and even though this movie is befor my time, i still loved it. More horror movies should be like this. It's exciting and heart pounding throughout the movie. I am forever an original Halloween Fan
