Ok I could of not picked a better night to watch this movie it was a thundering and lighting and it was at night no movie has scared me quite like this one see I can't see a poster or the movie box of this without screaming this movies is EXTREMLEY frightning I stayed awake two whole nights after seeing this and This movie is very distrubing, the images from this flim will haunt the mind for all eternity, at least I'll never forget them! I thought it was a great movie though! I mean there was never I moment that I wasn't scared I love the very beginning when the police investagation was going on it's intresting to see what they find during the investagation. I saw this one before the original one and the original was just as great as this one! and it also shows how tragic the whole thing was and this has got to be the most distrubing horror movie ever! but it defines horror it's a good movie it will 100% guarauntee make your skin crawl why even while I'm typing this review my skin is crawling and getting goosebumps and chills and before you watch it perpare yourself for a eternal scarefest and also perpare for the distrubing images your about to see, and see just how frighting this tragic story is you've been warned ahead of time...
