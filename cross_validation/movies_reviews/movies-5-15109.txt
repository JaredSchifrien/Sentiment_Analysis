Great movie that mixes drama and comedy. A movie where in one weekend 4 people begin to find their true selves. Very well written and in some places very funny. Michael Douglas gives one of the best performance of his career as Professor Grady Tripp. Tobey Maguire and Robert Downey Jr who are two of the best actors of their generations give terrific performances.
