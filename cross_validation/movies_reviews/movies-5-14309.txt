i thought this movie was fascinating. my favorite part was all of the voice overs that edward norton did in his mellow monotone, esspecially his i am jack bits. the whole look of the film was really intriguing, everything from the endless darkness to the strange costumes to the bloody fight scenes. i'll admit that i thought the movie lost strength towards the end, as if the wirter kind of ran out of steam. none the less it keeps you on the edge of your seat and leaves you thinking.
