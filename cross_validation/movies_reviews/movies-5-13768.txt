This movie is outstanding, not just for it's fine acting and interesting plot, but for it's ability to make the viewer think long and hard about the place the death penalty has in this so-called civilised society of ours. I would rate this movie as one of the best I have ever seen, and have watched it twice since I first saw it 3 months ago. A must-see for any adult who likes depth behind their entertainment.
