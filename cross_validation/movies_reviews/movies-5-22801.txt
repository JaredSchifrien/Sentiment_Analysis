I have not read any of the Harry Potter books, but I did not need too. I've seen the first two movies and they are two masterpieces. They will go down in history as classics. The movie is a pure cinematic gem that will take you into a world of wonderment and awe. Daniel Radcliffe is superb as Harry Potter who can act just as well as the veteran actors he's working with which include Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman Robbie Coltrane and Rex Harris. The other child actors Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are a delight. The story is terrific about a boy who grew up in a rather abusive home who discovers he is something special. Only more terrific than that, he doesn't flaunt it or abuse it, there is a great deal of humanity in Harry Potter. Story is superb, special effects will leave you in awe, characters are memorable and it's a movie one will want to watch again and again.
