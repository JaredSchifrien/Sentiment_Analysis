It's amazing this insignificant, low-budget piece of crap garnered the following it did, seeing that it's one of the worst films ever puked out by Hollywood. Starring unctuous P. Swayze, a clubfooted hoofer in need of acting lessions and pinchfaced little trollop Jennifer Grey, nice body, honker and all. The best thing about this turkey is the fact that it takes place in the Borscht Belt, oy vey, which harkens back to childhood memories in my long-distant past. Even the dancing, the supposed strong suit of this attempt at making a movie, was predictable and hardly impressive. What would have made this a better movie is if Grey did about fifteen nude scenes: this would have kept me from nodding off every five minutes or so. Cousin Brucie Morrow's favorite flick, and that tells you plenty.
