I really like comedies, Romance or both. This is so cute. Lucy saves this man from being hit by a train, pretends to be his fiance while he is in a coma but while he is in a coma Lucy falls in love with his brother Jack. Jack falls in love with her too. She tells them the truth before she gets married to the man in the coma, and then Jack proposes to her and they get married and go to Florence Italy so she can get a stamp on her passport.
