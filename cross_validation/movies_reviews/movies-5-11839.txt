I am in Total agreement with all the users that wrote that they enjoyed this movie, because I did too!, but come on now, Tara Reid, Parker Posey, and Alan Cummings should win an Oscar? That seems a little bit much! While the previously mentioned trio did steal the show, I think Oscar talk is a little silly for this kind of movie. It makes you laugh, which is what this kind of movie is supposed to do. As mentioned before, Tara Reid steals the show with such HILLARIOUS lines as The walls are mushy! , If I could go back in time...I would meet Snoopy! , I know what we can do...raise money for a search party, and organize a bake sale! and my person favorite But wouldn't it be cool if you could be in two rooms at once...I could be in here...AND over there! I could be in my room, and in the living room, and in the bathroom, and my closet, and back in my bathroom...and back in the living room! Just makes you giggle! Too bad it wasn't a big success at the box office!
