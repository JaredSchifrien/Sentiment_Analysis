This was a really awesome movie, and for some reason, that really was suprising to me. I always thought Jack Black was funny, and loved all his movies, but they were always despised by critics. When I heard about this movie, I thought this sounds great, too bad the critics will hate it. I was suprised when I picked up my Entertainment Weekly and saw an A. Then I saw more A's and couldn't believe it. I said to myself, I have to see this movie! I did, and wow, it was one of my favorites all year. What suprised me was that it was a good family film despite its PG-13 rating. Be sure to check it out if you get the chance. You will not be disappointed.
