I thought that it was quite funny. It kept my little brother laughing the whole time. It is not the best for adults but if your looking for something to keep alittle kid out of your hair for a while it is aweaome. The best part of the movie was the blooperes. Those were seriously funny. Most sequels are bad but this is almost as good as the second one. I recommend it.
