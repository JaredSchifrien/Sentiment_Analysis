A terrific movie for Ridley Scott. Perhaps one of the greatest and most terrible periods of human history is depicted here. You can feel yourself marching with the legions, armor shining in the sun. For a half a millenia they ruled the greater part of Earth. The Republic that became an empire, the General that became a slave, the slave that saved the Republic. A classic story pulled from the greatest civilization of all time, a must see for everyone.
