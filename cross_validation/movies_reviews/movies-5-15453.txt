This is the best movie of the year and possibly in recent years . The film touches on many subjects without being preachy , leaving the viewers with room for interpretations and thoughts which I think is clever . The music score and cinematography are perfect . I indeed prefer the movie than the book which can actually be preachy and full of prpogandas . For those who are offended by the abortion and incest themes , give me a break . What is the morality portrayed in American Beauty ( guns , infidelity and rape of the underaged girl ! ) ? Why people rarely condemn the themes in Pulp Fiction ( totally rubbish film which makes swearing sound cool and violence a norm ) ? I think many Americans are rather bored by such heart warming films like The Cider House Rules but cherish the violence and perverty in the aforementioned films . No wonder America has so many gunshot cases because people are so used to violence that guns are still not banned !
