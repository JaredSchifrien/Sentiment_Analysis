The first Pierce Brosnan James Bond film I saw was Die Another Day . It was the first James Bond film I actually saw in a theater since the 1970's. I took my 10-year-old son to see it. It was his first James Bond film, and he totally loved it! Pierce Brosnan is absolutely great in the role! He is definitely the closest thing to Sean Connery in the entire series! He and I are the same age which makes me a little biased, but I did not know this when I saw the film. Tomorrow Never Dies was actually the second film of Pierce Brosnan's that I saw. It was absolutely excellent. I was just as excited as in any of the Connery movies. Roger Moore was allright, but just did not have the physical presence of Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan, however I do like his different approach to the portrayal of James Bond. I certainly did miss the aura of Sean Connery until he reappeared in Never Say Never Again in 1983. It was certainly a welcome sight. The only thing that I didn't like aboug that movie was the absence of the original opening logo and the original James Bond music. Other than that it was an excellent movie. I remember when my own father took me to the drive-in movie in 1962 to see Dr.No . The only two things that I remembered from that film were Ursula Andress rising from the sea in the bikini scene , and Dr. No's unsuccesful attempts to grab onto the pipes with his steel hands when he drowned at the end of the movie. Those memories have stayed with me all these years. I have truly grown up with the James Bond films and will always love them and consider them one of the most enjoyable parts of my life!
