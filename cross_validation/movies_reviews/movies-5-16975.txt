On my top five of 2001 list. Vanilla Sky is a dizzying brilliant film from Cameron Crowe. You wouldn't expect a film like this coming from Crowe, which makes it all the more cool to experience. A strange, mind bending tripinto the seemingly charmed life of the young owner of a magazine publishing company. All is going well until he bumps and grinds the wrong blonde. What happens next is an unstoppable rollercoaster into the bizarre and incredibly beautiful. Surreal and fantastic, Vanilla Sky is a visionary film perfected and will blow your mind right out of your head. Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz,Kurt Russel and Jason Lee all put in commendable performances. Cameron Diaz sticks out the most as the obsessive psycho girl Cruise banged four times in one night. Diaz is creepy as all hell and somewhat reminds me of a few of my ex's. A pure masterpiece. Crowe has made a work of art. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Absolutly astonishing.
