I felt I had to rate this film to point out an error a lot of people seem to be making. The fighting that everyone is going mad about in the film, while being very accurate and thus nasty to watch, is also supposed to symbolise the inner turmoil going on within Edward Nortons charachter. The person who recommended people watch it but fast forward the fight scene's, is mis guiding people. The fight scenes are as important as the rest of the story, as they are supposed to give you an actualisation of his inner turmoil. Well, in my opinion, anyway. One more point- everyone seems to think that the main charachters name is Jack (Nortons), but if you watch the film again, you will see he only adopts this name after reading an article in a magazine he found in the house he shares with tyler- something about Jack's Kidney or something- anyway the point is we never find out his name, as it's not considered important because all that happens is done by Tyler anyway. Opinionated- I am, Right- your call!
