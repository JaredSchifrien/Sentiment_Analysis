Based on the book of the same title by James Ellroy (Very good author and if you like the film you should read the Dudley Smith Trio book) It carries off the style of Hollywood 1950's very well and the cast is amazing. Yes, the story is slow, but its meant to be. If you want a fast, simple film with loads of action then go and watch some of the s**t action films that Hollywood now spews out. This is a film thats meant to challenge you, make you think. Kevin Spacey is as magnificent as ever. If you liked him in 'The Usual Suspects' you'll definately like him in this. Russell Crowe plays a character that actually has some depth and shows off his acting abilities and Kim Basinger is absolutely stunning as the Veronica Lake look-alike (and she actually does look like her) but also shows that she can act - I'd say that this is her best film. Guy Pearce is outstanding and I'd say this is another film of his to be added to the list where he shows that Neighbours is way behind him now. This film is full of suspense, twists, sub plots, the corruption of the LAPD and shows the underworld of Hollywood. If you appreciate good acting and an intelligent plot, tehn this is a film for you.
