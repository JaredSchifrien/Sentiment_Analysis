I didn't think it could be done, but Peter Jackson absolutely nailed it. He captured the spirit of the world of Tolkien in a way that was respectful of the book, but not handcuffed by it. He told the story of the Fellowship of the Ring the way it deserved to be told - with excellent characters / actors, plenty of allusions to the saga's history, and with breathtaking special effects. This movie was EPIC - in its visuals, in its storyline, and in its execution. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone - to fans of Tolkien and first timers alike. Like so many others on this board, I am going to have a hard time waiting a year for the next one!
