Wow, this movie sure is being hated upon! Not all movies were made to teach a deep and resounding lesson. Some were put on this earth to simply entertain and I think this movie definently accomplishes that. Yeah, a lot of guys want to get into Jane Fonda's plastic duds, but that's only because she is one kick-ass evil fighting princess. The effects are so goofy (the mathmos cracks me up every time)and the acting campy, but one has to keep in mind that not only is this a Roger Vadim film, it's also a 70's B-movie. It was ahead of it's time, still staying true to it's 70's sci-fi roots. People go into watching this movie expecting some earth shaking spectacular-of course they are going to be disapointed! But There is so much about this movie that makes it entertaining-not necessarily 'good', but entertaining. The music, the cute blind angel dude, the Black Tyrant lady that keeps calling Barbie a pretty kitty , that darn mathmos, the bird attack, the hairy man who lives in what looks to be a plastic cornucopia-how could I help but to love it? If ever I need a cheering up, I'll just pop in this movie and all again will be well with the world.
