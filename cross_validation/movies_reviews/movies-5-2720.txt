The... Z slice it's mark once again on to the cinema screens...! This story and theme was so well produced! The character more than came to life on the screen. Zorro himself was so much better portrayed than those of many years ago. His daughter, well, I don't wish to perterb her father by mentioning how incredibly pretty she was in this movie, but she was. A bit graphic in the realism of violence dept. But a movie well worth watching.
