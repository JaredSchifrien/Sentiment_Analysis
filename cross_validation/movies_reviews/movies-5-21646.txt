I can't possibly write everything that I want too because it would take up about three pages. But I'll give it a try. I have been saying for months that this will be the greatest movie ever, it's a thousand times better than I thought. Granted there are some changes from the book, but that is understandable. I saw The Fellowship of the Ring opening day, first showing of course and have seen the movie five times since and plan on seeing it many, many, many more times. Every Actor/Actress was absolutely amazing and 100% true to the book they all deserve an Oscar. EVERYTHING was breathtaking. I laughed, cried, was frightened, and felt all the emotions of the fellowship. This movie was sheer perfection. No words can describe how wonerful this movie really was. My favorite characters were Frodo Baggins(Elijah Wood), Samwise Gamgee(Sean Astin), Meridoc Brandybuck(Dominic Monaghan), and last but not least Perigrin Took(Billy Boyd). Hobbiton was so amazing the detail was unbeleivable. I cannot pick a favorite scene, it was all great. I'm going insane waiting for The Two Towers to come out, one year seems like an eternity away. I have read the books 10 times and I'm sure that J.R.R. Tolkien would have been extreamly proud of Peter Jackson on directing the greatest movie of all time.
