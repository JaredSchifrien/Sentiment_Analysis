I've been a big fan of the comic and cartoons for a while now but never thought the movie would do it justice. But after seeing it I was wrong. Personally I found it to be a great movie to watch that was fun and not only did I enjoy it but so did the others that I went with and they knew absolutely nothing about the X-Men before seeing this film. That's why I thought it was such a success, you don't have to be a fan to enjoy it. ( and Hugh Jackman was great )
