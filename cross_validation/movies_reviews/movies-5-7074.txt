This movie was great I like how even though they had movies in color then I like how it's in black and white cause it gives it the old monster movie feel. It's also a very funny movie, I like the dance scene and I like how the wife of the guy falls in love with Frankenstein. I love Igor's eyes they are so funny! this movie is a comedy classic very good movie indeed.
