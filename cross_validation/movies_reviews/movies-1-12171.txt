Another attempt at a Bret Easton Ellis novel being made into a movie, and yet another failure. Why can't they find a good director, screen writer, or even producers to make one of his books into a movie that is actually worth watching? It is a complete travesty, and I find it very surprising that Bret would allow his books to be butchered so massively without any care in the world. I almost cried by how horrible this movie was....you would be better off reading the novel, trust me.
