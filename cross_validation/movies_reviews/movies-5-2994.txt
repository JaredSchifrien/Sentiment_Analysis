Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze, surfing, sky diving, and bank robbing - what more could you ask for? No seriously, I'm not sure why this movie is so entertaining, but it is. Lots of great action scenes tied together by a storyline of rebelling against authority makes this a nice little movie. Don't expect anything deep (after all, Keanu is the star), but Point Break is a very entertaining movie just the same.
