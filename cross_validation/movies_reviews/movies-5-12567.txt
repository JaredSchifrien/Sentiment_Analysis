Holocaust movie, but it takes place in present day (not too many flashbacks either, and those are hazy): "Never forget." That's the whole movie, but I haven't ruined it for you, since the impact is in the delivery. Glorious Van Gogh colors, quirky touches of humor, then hinting entry of unease, and "whomp!" a blow to the chest leaving me dumbfounded, frozen, eyes welled-up--when I got to my car I cried and couldn't stop. Wows, huhs, a psychological trip I couldn't forget if I tried. Stars Elijah Wood as Jonathan, "the collector," an American Jew who ponders a photo of late grandfather w/mysterious woman from WWII Ukraine and sets on a journey to find her. Hooks up w/makeshift family buisness "Heritage Tours" that guides rich Jews thru Ukraine in search of personal history. Cranky old grandfather Alex drives (tho he claims he's blind), Americaphile grandson Alex translates, and Sammy Davis Jr, Jr ("seeing eye bitch") rides along. (historical background, not from movie: after Nazi invasion of Soviet Union, mass killings of Jews were done by mobile units, even by auxiliary police and pogroms conducted by locals...Ukraine, place of movie, was one such place)
