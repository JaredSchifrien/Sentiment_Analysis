Great movie! The cinematography, direction, script, and soundtrack really propelled this movie. Very true to the cynicism in the dating scene, the difficulty for young men to relate to the world (parents, women), cool metaphors (Christ in the church, the fishbowl, him in the scuba gear, Ms. Robinson in the hallway after he spills the beans - all symbols of alienation) - the hip style of this film is superb. Copied by movies like Ferris Bueller. Very dark, chic, hip, urbane, funny, witty. I like movies that leave you wondering. They symbolize where men and women are headed in the future and what they ultimately will mean to each other. I also like how we never really know what's in his head - he's more a symbol than a character. All of that and the soundtrack leave a haunting image.
