 When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are I can still hear the diminutive cricket s voice as he very soberly looks up into the heavens. Pinocchio is Disney at its very best and most pure. Great story, great moral, and expertly produced animation. Even now with all our 21st century computer generated sophistication you have to admire the creativity, talent, skill and vast amount of time that went into producing such a gem. Great, timeless animated feature.
