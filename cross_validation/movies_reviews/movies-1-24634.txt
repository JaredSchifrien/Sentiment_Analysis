This movie was horrible. They took out all the interesting and freaky parts that were in the original. They seemed to be more interested in fighting scenes and chases than any of the subtle freaky parts that were in the first movie. The humans spoke English .. which I found weird. Mark Wahlberg . . .although may be nice to look at . . is a horrible actor. He was not convincing at all. . .especially in his uplifting speech to the humans! Save your money . . watch the original when it comes on TV again.
