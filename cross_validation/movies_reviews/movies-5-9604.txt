Without a doubt the funniest movie of all time. Jim Carey is maybe the funniest person ever, and Jeff Daniels isn't to shabby either. I have to say it is ridiculus that this movie is rated as low as it is. There are many classic scenes in this movie, and it should be listed #1. Dumb and Dumber should get the recognition it deserves.
