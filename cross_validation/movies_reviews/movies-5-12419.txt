I thoroughly enjoyed this film from beginning to end. Granted, I'm fascinated by the history of the time period portrayed and the politics involved. If you're not interested in those things you may not get much from the movie . . . but you should. See it anyway & try to understand what it's all about. What it's about is as current today as it was way back when. Funny (or not) how history repeats. A film of this type, with this message will always be relavent, no matter which side of the political spectrum you prefer. I thought the movie was brilliantly filmed in black & white. I enjoyed the editing and camera angles. The dialougue is intelligent and, at times, quite funny in a low-key sort of way. There's more going on than meets the eye. Finally, the movie made me want to find out even more about the characters involved. If a film can make me pick up a book then it has done it's job.
