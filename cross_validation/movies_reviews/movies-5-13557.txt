This movie takes everything that is considered taboo or nasty and shows people that stuff like that really can happen. By the end of the movie, you are definitely left w/this weird feeling, like you wish things hadn't been so bad for the neighbor, you wish Spacey's character hadn't gotten shot...what a good movie.
