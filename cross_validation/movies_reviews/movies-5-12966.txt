A beautiful movie. I like it more each time that I see it. One of those rare movies that is able to leave the viewer with a powerful message without coming off as preachy. To me, the message was that a person with good intentions can have a positive, important impact on whatever environment in which he finds himself - no matter how hopeless or unfair that environment is. Andy Dufresne touched everyone who he came in contact with, and many with whom he did not. And in the end, he was made the life for himself which he wanted. A powerful film.
