Dear 'Gone Away'.....Why dont people like you get your facts right when it comes to great movies like this. It was NOT Myrna Loy it was Gloria Swanson ! This is pur 'film noir' and a classic and anybody who doesn't appreciate the great quoted one-liners like 'I am big, its the pictures that got small !' is NOT a real movie buff. One of then all time great films with Hollywood poking fun of itself! A true classic
