This movie IS a masterpiece (same with the book) It was not a scary movie but it was so deep and powerful.The ending wasn't the best and ther movie wasn't true to the novel which was a very,very good book but the movie is far from bad. It was very interesting and the 2 girls that were killed and was haunting Danny was really freaky.A great movie,despite a few flaws. It deserves a 4.5 but since I can't,it deserves a 5 than a 4.
