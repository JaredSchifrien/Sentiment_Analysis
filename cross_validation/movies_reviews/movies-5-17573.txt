Wow do I like this film. Well done, beautiful cinematography, wonderful character, and a very compelling story. I've seen this film several times and would have no hesitation watching it again, in fact I'd look forward to it. When the Grandpa pulls a shotgun out from under the breakfast table, and in front of the whole family tries and fails to shoot a mouse in the doorway and everyone falls silent as he stews over it (great grumpy, fuddy duddy English grandfather) and the little boy says I think you got him grandpa, I think he was limping Well you have to see it but it's funny trust me.
