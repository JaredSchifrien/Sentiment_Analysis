Well, if you have read any of my other movie reviews, you will know that it is not odd that I JUST saw this movie. I did hear great reviews of American Beauty and I know that it won best picture, however, I really had no clue what it was about. I was intrigued and captivated throughout the entire movie. Shocking, surreal yet eerily possible. The characters were definitely the extreme, however I am afraid that in this day and age, they weren't too far off the mark. Kevin Spacey and Annete Bening gave extraordinary performances. There are definitely some very disturbing issues being tackled, or explored, but this is surely a movie worth seeing. It was comedic as well as entertaining and thought provoking and ironic.
