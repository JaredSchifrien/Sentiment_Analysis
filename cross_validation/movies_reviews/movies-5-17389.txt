 Run Lola Run is a fast moving train ride set in with great dance music. I enjoyed this movie and nearly wanted to join in with the running. I have is movie in my movie collection. This is for people who dislike reading subtitles of any foreign movie. Watch a movie of a foreign country, it doesn't matter where (Japan, China, South Africa, Vietnam.)and see how much any good foreign movie like RUN LOLA RUN can be. Don't mind the subtitles, because in the great words of CHAIRMAN YI-YI, reading liberates the mind. If haven't seen RUN LOLA RUN see it.
