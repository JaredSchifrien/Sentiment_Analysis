It is definately a movie to watch with the FAMILY. I found it to be very entertaining and witty at times, and Nicholas Cage, as always gave an awesome performance. I really enjoyed watching Cage's character change throughout the film, going from the rich snobbish playboy to the FAMILY MAN. It is definately one worth seeing.
