Super! I've seen dozens of times & it still grabs me. The writing is superb, the acting terrific & the tension really builds as the Alien slowly picks off one at a time. The best scene is where Ripley (after everyone else is killed) almost runs into the creature on her way into the shuttle. It's creepy as it sneaks around the corner. Also horrifying is where the alien comes upon Parker & Lambert while they're collecting up the coolant. If you're a horror/sci-fi fan, you must have this in your collection!
