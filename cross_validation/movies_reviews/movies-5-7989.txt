One hell of a funny movie- my absolute favorite of all time. When I was little I could recite Mrs. Doubtfire's lines from beginning to end. A whole lot of memoriable scenes- including the notorious scene where Mrs. Doubtfire is cooking in the kitchen.... My first day as a woman and I'm already getting hot flashes. LOL. This movie is definately a classic- Robin Williams is hilarious and did a wonderful job doing the drama scenes in this movie as well. It was a run by fruiting! . A great film- it deserves to be in the top 10.
