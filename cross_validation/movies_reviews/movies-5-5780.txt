 I'm crazy about you, baby! says Fred Macmurray passionately to Barbara Stanwyck. This may explain why he throws caution to the wind to develop an ingenious plot to murder her husband and collect the insurance money. The kind of thriller typically described as atmospheric , Double Indemnity is a satisfying tale of suspense and murder with wonderful performances from the two leads and the ever-reliable Edward G Robinson. Billy Wilder directs skillfully and Miklos Rozsa supplies the brooding musical score. Has some wonderful moments - not to be missed!
