I believe this is one of the top five movies ever made. If it has any flaws, I cannot see them, and I have seen it over thirty times. Polanski directs a masterpiece, Nicholson is masterful, subduing his usual performance, and the rest of the cast is superb. As well written a movie as I've ever seen. Amusing to see this called over-rated by people whose literary and cinematic tastes appear to be at the grade seven level of comprehension. Ah well, different strokes.....
