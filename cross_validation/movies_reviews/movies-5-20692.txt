This was a very well done movie I think that Julia Andrews played a wonderful Maria who was the governess of the Vontrap family. The kids always try to scare away each of the other governeses so they could spend more time with their Dad but they like to have Maria because she taught them how to sing. I also like where the show them running away from Austria to get away from the Nazis'.
