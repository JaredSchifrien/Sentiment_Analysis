Considered to be an essential classic outside the English-speaking world (where it was cut and poorly dubbed upon its release), the Leopard is a brilliant depiction of Italian/ Sicilian aristocracy in decline and of the rising bourgeoisie. Despite being very long and slow-moving, the film is beautiful to watch and makes interesting philosphical reflections both at the political and personal level. Burt Lancaster gives a majestic performance (one of his very best) as the aging aristocrat who must come to terms with changing values and social structures. Not for die-hard action fans, but a great movie nevertheless!
