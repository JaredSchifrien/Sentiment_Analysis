It may not have been historically accurate in every detail but this film did an excellent job in capturing the essence of a righteous cause and the valor and honesty of the great Scottish hero William Wallace. I have not been so completely moved, excited or entertained by a film in many years. Mel Gibson was at his very best portraying Wallace as the strong, determined, kindhearted man and somewhat reluctant hero. It was thrilling to experience for the first time on the big screen and definitely a must have for my personal video collection. If you want to know more about the real William Wallace, read John MacKay s book (William Wallace Brave Heart). If you want to experience the pure excitement of both the myth and legend watch the future movie classic Braveheart !
