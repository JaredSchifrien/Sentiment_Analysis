Thw best of the Quentin Tarintino trilogy and his first. This film is executed marvolously. Everything is believable, every line a character has seems real and almost immproved. Also very original to take a crime movie away from the crime that has been commited and tell the stories through series of flashbacks for every primary character and through scenes of the aftermath. No director with a right mind could ask for a better ensemble cast to bring this picture to life. Heavy hitters like Harvey Keitel,Tim Roth,Steve Buscemi(in one of his most memrobale roles) and Michael Madson really make this a unbelievably good crime drama. Filled with as much humor as action. Of course this is Tarintino humor so it is a bit morbid and crude at times. There is one line inparticular that nails me every time. When Mr.Pink keeps asking Joe why he has to be Mr.Pink and then Joe's reply puts me on the ground. A must see for any fan of Tarintino or great story telling seen through the eyes of a visionary film maker.
