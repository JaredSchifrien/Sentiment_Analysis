First of all, let me start by stating that I have followed the Marvel Comic's X-Men for quite awhile. I think the movie was excellent. All though some of the characters could have been introduced and expounded on... (such as Storm)... the over all casting was terrific! I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone with any interests in a good flic!! I am eagerly awaiting a sequel!!
