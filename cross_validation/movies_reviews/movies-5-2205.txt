I went into The Count of Monte Cristo with expectancy. I have always known that Jim Caviezel can award the viewer with an outstanding performance, and this was no exception. This is by far his best performance to date. Although I hear that the book is quite different (and have discovered so since I have begun to read it) I enjoyed the movie completely. I would suggest it to anyone who would like to see a movie with a little bit of everything--romance, adventure, intrigue--all wrapped up into one spectacular film.
