The American Film Institute calls CITIZEN KANE the greatest American movie of all time. Would you? I would most definately! What amazes me is how a man like Orson Welles, a twenty five year old, inexperienced man could walk into a studio like RKO and take complete control over the entire production of the film! RKO sure made the right decision because CITIZEN KANE is a masterpiece! It's WELLES masterpiece! Had he not gotten his way, this would not be the great film it is. Truly amazing!
