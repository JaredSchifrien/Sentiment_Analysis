One of the few lengthy movies that fights through the slower areas well and keeps the audience interested. A masterful performance by Guiness. To me his character was a madman and so driven to his cause as a soldier that only at the very end does he regain his sanity. The supporting cast was numerous and very well done. I would dispute this idea it was a war movie. The Great Escape was more of a war movie in overall context and presentation. At least in that several moments of fighting took place and there were scenes with nazis and a motorcycle chase. Escape even had a plane crash. Kwai was more of a drama that simply used war as a backdrop to an engrossing story. A fine film whether you like war movies or not.
