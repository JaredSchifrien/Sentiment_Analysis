One of Jennifer Connelly's first films and se is fantastic. Jim Hensons muppets are fantastic and David Bowie is fantastic as per usual, even if he is singing awful 80's songs! I agree with bascillam if you like this, you'll like Dark Crystal (why don't they show this on TV anymore??) It is very good for kids because it shows they have to take responsibility for their actions. Overall a very fun, dark film that appeals to all ages.
