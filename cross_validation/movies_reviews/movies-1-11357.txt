Isn't it wonderful that the idea of a girl growing up these days requires that she dress like a slut, bare the midriff, and have pants that barely come up past the pubic line? I have no idea what this movie is about, but once again here's a child actor who turns 18 and suddenly dresses like s street walker. I'm so glad I don't have children.
