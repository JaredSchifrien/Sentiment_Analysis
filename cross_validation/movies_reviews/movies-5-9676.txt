This is an all time classic movie that needs to be a part of everyone's home collection of movies. It is the kind of comedy you can watch literally over and over (believe me, I have tested this true) and it is still funny. Not only funny, but you never get sick of it. You can constantly discover new lines throughout it. Jim Carey was great. And who knew that Harry (I don't remember what his name is in real life) was even funny. This was a whole new role for him. Anyways, I love Dumb and Dumber.
