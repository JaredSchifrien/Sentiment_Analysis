This film is absolutely amazing and for me it is far superior than the book it originated from (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Phillip Dick) I grew up watching this film and I expect my kids will grow up watching classics such as this and Star Wars too if I have my way. It has an absolutly fantastic cast, Hsrrison Ford, Sean Young, Reutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah and many others. Its an extremely dark film, not only with the plot, but with the sets as well. I'm not going to rehash the plot of the film as you can find out from other comments that have been made. The photography is amazing, the actors are extremely convincing and I think that this film helped make some of them in the film industry and Vangelis' music is absolutely gorgeous and brings a great ambience to the film. This film is still one of the best, there was love with making this film and its far, far better than the majority of movies that were made today - after all, most of the films released now are just thinking about how much money they can make at the box office.
