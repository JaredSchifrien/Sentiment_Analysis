2 breakfasts please! LOL Da two yutes... The what? 'Da two yutes'.. did you say yutes? 'sorry your honor the two yoouuuthhzzzzz! This movie was cute and funny from start to finish. The scene on the porch of the cabin between Joe Peci' and Marisa Tomei was hysterical... as was the scene when his suit gets ruined and he has to walk into court wearing a ridiculous suit from the mid 1800's that he got at a second hand store. Im laughing just thinking about it.
