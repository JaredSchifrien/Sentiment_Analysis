I've decided that the incredibly positive reviews of Minority Report are the result of The Emperor's New Clothes phenomenon. That's the only way I can explain how such a HORRIBLE movie could receive accolades across the board. Here are my major complaints: 1. The plot was flimsy and even ridiculous in many spots. 2. There was almost no character development. 3. The special effects were ludicrous and inconsistent. 4. The acting was a terrible. 5. The movie was FAR too long, and the ending was laughable. There are many other problems with the movie, but I don't have two more hours to record them all in my comment. All I can say is avoid this movie at all costs!
