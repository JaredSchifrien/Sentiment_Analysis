By far the best movie ever made! It's definitely my favorite. I had the honor of seeing it in an old, preserved theater in Milwaukee, WI and it was a very emotional experience. I love Donald O'Connor's energy, Debbie Reynolds's spunk, and who doesn't adore Gene Kelly's romp through the rain while he's singing the title track?
