This movie is definately in my top 10...if not top 5 greatest movies of all time. Never has a movie made me laugh, and cry so much. This movie definately reminds me of America in the late 80's, early 90's, and it is totally underrated. Winona Ryder, Christian Slater, and even Shannen Doughtery gave Oscar worthy performances, but were barely mentioned at all. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who digs dark comedy. You might be pleasantly surprised.
