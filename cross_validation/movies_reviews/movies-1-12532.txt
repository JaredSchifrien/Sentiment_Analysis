Unless you need to take kids to a relatively clean movie, I would avoid Kicking and Screaming. I'm told it's a comedy but I didn't laugh. I almost walked out of the theater 20 minutes into the movie because it was so boring. Unfortunately I stayed and the movie never got any better. Save your money and see something, anything, else.
