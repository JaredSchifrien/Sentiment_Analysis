This movie definitely makes my A list. I found it thoroughly entertaining, and hilariously funny. I have heard it said that this movie contributed nothing new that was not already hashed over in Lock, Stock and Two Loaded Barrels. I differ in that I found it to be a terrific finishing of Lock, Stock... If you are in the mood for some fine humor with a little gore and a good deal of bad language, this would be a good pick. I place this movie in the same category as Pulp Fiction which I also found highly enjoyable.
