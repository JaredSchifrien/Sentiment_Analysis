Totally unfunny movie that had perhaps two decent scenes in it. This garbage is best suited for the mental retards who think Adam Sandler and the other imbecile, Jim Carry are a hoot. George W. loves this movie, which tells you alot. The only saving grace of this film was the art direction. As for the rest, pure dreck.
