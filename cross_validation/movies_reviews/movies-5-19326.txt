This is an amazing film very gothic I would recomend it to everyone including goths. The film is very deep and I can relate to Ian Snyder (Jake Richardson) because i get treated badly aswell. Watching Hangman's Curse really helped me realize that im am not the only goth who gets treated badly. Thanks for reading this.
