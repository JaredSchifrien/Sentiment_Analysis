Classic film making. Nothing offensive or violent. Catchy music, just feel good all the way. If your into gritty reality, this is NOT the flick for you. If you just want to be entertained and have fun, this is the cream of the crop. I first saw it when I was about 9 years old and tole my Mom I was going to marry Julie Andrews when i grew up. She didn't wait for me, though. Julie, if you're reading this, I still love you, babe!!! You are one of my favorite things!!!!
