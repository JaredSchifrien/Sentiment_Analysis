One of the best movies that I've seen in a long time. To truly understand this movie you need to pay attention. In other words: If you have A.D.D. than don't bother with this one because you'll find yourself asking a lot of questions. But if you enjoy a good action/adventure epic with many scenes of graphic violence then this is the movie for you. But please do not confuse this movie with BraveHeart, only idiots that like to make generalizations would ever get the two confused.
