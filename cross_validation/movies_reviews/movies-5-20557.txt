The great classics don't get old. I did watch this when I was young and I did not ignore any of the parts. Not only I like the title music, but also "Gotta Dance", "Make 'em Laugh" & "Good Morning to You." Debbie Reynolds was one of the best voice overs for a beautiful, but squeaky woman in the movie that the actores wanted to produce. Love that one. Nothing can duplicate that MGM Masterpice now.
