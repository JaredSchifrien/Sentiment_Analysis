Simply a fantastic piece of work. One of the best acting roles in the history of movies, is done in this film, by Anthony Perkins. I have never seen someone who can so fully play a part. What a magnificent job. The action is exciting, the horror is intense, and in general, this is total 5 star stuff. Definitely see it, for anyone.
