FANTASTIC!! C it or you'll regret it! This is an original piece that is so entertaining, not because it makes you laugh to death but because of it's very subtle humour and classic-gags. It is one that u can watch over over again. It's great 4 adults and 4 kids. The characters are well-defined and even oscar worthy. The time and effort put into this film shines through and is one for the collection.
