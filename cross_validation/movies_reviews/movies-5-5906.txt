Alfred Hitchcock is a genious. An undeniable genious. To all the people unfamiliar with his work and wondering why he is hailed as such should just watch this movie and they will understand. The last scene so stirred me-The way Hitchcock blended the ironicies of good and evil was purely brilliant. When the nun emerged from the stairs into the darkness, she appeared an evil, ominious being only to come into the light-a symbol of rightiousness and good-and have to deal with death that she inadvertantly caused..wow. The rest of the movie was subtley crafted to be gloriously unsettling as well; it's defiently near the top of my favoritie Hitchock movies.
