A movie that contains no optimism and has protagonists spreading evil, this one should certainly be avoided at all costs by everyone. The hero of the movie containmates restaurant food and makes illegal soap. These insane people then want to fight to be able to feel. That makes no sense. This, of course, leads to alot of gore and blood, with senseless violence all around. Of course, this terror of a movie got critically acclaimed. But we all know adult means sexual and gritty means filled to the brim with senseless violence. Whatever happened to the G-rated live-action genre?
