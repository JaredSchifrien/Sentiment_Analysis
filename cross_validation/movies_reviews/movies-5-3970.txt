When I first saw Mary Poppins I was four years old and loved the songs and the magic. Julie Andrews is fabulous as the practically perfect eponymous heroine. I am now 21 and still love Mary Poppins, it is still my favourite film, and any film that can captivate different generations after almost half a century has to be something special. As a child you will love the energy and enthusiasm of the film, it's playful creativity and the way that it brings out the child in each character. As an adult you will appreciate a depth to the story that is rare in children's movies, the redemption of the father figure is truly touching and David Tomlinson's performance is incredible.Much of the movie is aimed at pleasing all generations. This is the one movie which can truly be called a family picture. There can be no better advert for Disney and for children's films than Mary Poppins. Splendid, splendid!
