Cannot avoid watching it over and over whenever it comes on TV. Captivating scenes, music background, the stars of that day and the starting Omar Sharif. This, Out of Africa, Gone with the Wind, Dances with Wolves, In Harms Way, The Longest Day, and more stand out as keepers in my book. Does anyone know the shooting/edit goof (Royale) made in Pulp Fiction? When you watch again, watch for bullet holes to appear in the wall in the scene before guns were fired that missed Samuel L. Jackson and provided his miracle. Larry in L. A.
