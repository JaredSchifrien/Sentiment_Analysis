I put seeing this movie off for a while because of its length, finally saw it this past weekend. It certainly falls in the category of different . Other than the plane crash, it doesn t really have any true action or suspense, but for some strange reason I couldn t pull myself away from wondering what was going to happen next. Now you might say, well that s suspense, it was and it wasn t. There have been a lot of films put out that tried to tap human suffering, or the human condition . Cast Away didn t just tap it, it tapped a main line feed from the core. Tom Hanks was brilliant, how many actors can take up over half of a movie solo and never loose an audience? Not many. I see some questioning the ending, at first I was a little miffed at its, seemingly clich who knows how what decision will be made ending. However, the more I thought about it, how else could it end. Anything else would have been considered predictable, too convenient, too wrapped up in a pretty bow. I thought the ending fit rather nicely within the whole theme of life sucks but not really too awful bad.
