Blade Runner is an awe inspiring post-modern materpiece. It creates a bleak future composed of the bureaucratic elite and the middled sleazy subterranean underworld (that looks a lot like Hong Kong) where a detective is assigned on search and destroy missions to eliminate replicas, or artificial humans disiguised for slave labor. The punch that Blade Runner packs is on account of its sensitivity to real concerns in contemporary society, and modern thought. After a while the detective (played by Harrison Ford) has touble discriminating between the replicas and the real people, dilema that seems far too real in a time when great thinkers are proposing that it will only be a matter of time before machines have consciousness.
