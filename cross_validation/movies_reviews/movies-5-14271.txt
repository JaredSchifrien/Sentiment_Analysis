A very good movie. The first time I watched it I didn't get it. I watched it again and listened to an interview of Ed Norton, and Brad Pitt, then I began to get it. Since then I've probably watched it two or 3 more times and pick up more and more each time. It's a brilliant film. How I didn't see it from the beginning I don't know. The twists and turns this movie take. It really makes you pay attention and think, it's not a movie that you can flip back and forth to or watch while you're doing something else. Ed Norton-a fantastic actor. Brad Pitt-more than just a pretty face. I like to watch this when I'm alone so there are no distractions.
