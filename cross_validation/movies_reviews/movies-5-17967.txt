Now here's a horror movie. This movie can give you nightmares for the rest of your life. You know it's a scary movie when you won't dare show your kids. If this movie wasn't good it wouldn't be legend by now. Everyone knows about it and everyone's seen it. I would give this movie an A+ for scariness.
