Magnolia is an excellent movie. The storylines were riveting and the acting was believable and moving. Definitely a movie I plan to watch again. I am sure there are many things I will pick up. I was never bored, even if I felt that I may start to lose interest, the story changed, yet not too abruptly. This is definitely one of those movies that you will be thinking about for days after you watch it..and you should, there are some huge issues being challenged and discussed. Every single actor gave an outstanding performance..on a side note, I couldn't believe how many of the cast were also in Boogie Nights. interesting
