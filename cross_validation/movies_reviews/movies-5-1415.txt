I loved this movie,and if there is only 1 reason why it should receive 5*, it's because of the incredible amount of work that went into it, on all levels, to create a brilliant piece of art.The opening songby The Doors, The Flying Dutchman, I can get no satisfaction by the Stones and especially the Hendrix solo in the outpost scene are one of the best songs chosen for a film that I ever seen.Wow.As for the rest of its qualities...too short here.Brilliant.
