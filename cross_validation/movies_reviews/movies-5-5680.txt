I think the reason I love the movie so much is because of the characters in the movie. They are all so beautifully written, and you really feel like you get to know each of the principal characters in the movie. Scarlett in my opinion is one the most complex characters ever written. She starts out as a silly teenager who only cares about herself, boys and parties, (like most teenage girls). Then because of the tragedies and hardships she has to grow up and become this very mature woman capable of taking care of not only herself, but her entire family. The acting in this movie is perfect, each actor/actress really embrasses their character. Vivian Leigh especially. In my own opinion this is by far the best ensemble cast of any movie.
