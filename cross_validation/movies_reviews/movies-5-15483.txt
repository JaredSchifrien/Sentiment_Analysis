I just saw this movie a few nights ago- and all I can say is WOW. What a film! It is probably one of the most accurate historical dramas of our time. Definately up at the top of the list of the movies of the last few years. Two things bugged me about this film- the role of Ken O'Donnell was sorely misrepresented as he did not have nearly as much of a role in the crisis. The other was Kevin Costner's ridiculous attempt at a Boston accent. Other than that- this really proved to be an entertaining film with supurb acting, even by Kevin Costner. The actor who played John Kennedy, Bruce Greenwood was astounding- he had Kennedy's accent down pact. Overall, I would recommend this to even people who are not too fond of Kennedy as it does not portray him as some kind of a God, even mentioning his attempts at assassinating Castro during his term in office. Bruce Greenwood did a great job of communicating the President's struggles with the audience. Definately a film to see!
