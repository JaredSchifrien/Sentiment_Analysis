The best super-hero movie of all time, with one of John Williams' best scores. 2001's DVD release of the 1978 film is really good, but beware: the commentary track is shabby and badly recorded, and the isolated score track fails to live up to its promise. Otherwise, this presentation of the film and the other extras are great.
