I hated this movie because of Mickey Rooney's performance. He was terrible, honestly. He donned coke-bottle glasses and buck teeth to play a Japanese guy. How mean can Rooney be? Seriously, Being asian is not a crime. And Audrey Hepburn, She didn't seem to pack much talent. She was more of the looks type. She was famous because she packed visually, not talent.
