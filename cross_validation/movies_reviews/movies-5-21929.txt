I think if you see this and Cameron as great BECAUSE they introduced Edward Furlong is plain ridiculous and sad. T2:Judgement Day should be respected (especially the Ultimate Edition DVD) for visual effects galore. They revolutionized the industry more than you people realize!! Think back to movies of old, including the '70s flicks (Star Wars, Aliens) and looks at those effects compared to the T-1000's medamorphesis to a man in a cop uniform. Then, you have to look at the fact that The Matrix effects were somewhat made the same. But, those aren't the only great things I admired about T2, it was every little joke made by Arnold, George Thoroughgood's Bad to the Bone which is like the best song attachment to any movie, and the way Cameron causes to emotionally attach and love the terminator, the end was enough to make every break down crying. Good acting, unrateable visual effects--they're that good! Definitely buy the Ultimate Edition DVD of this sci-fi masterpiece.
