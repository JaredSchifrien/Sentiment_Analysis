I finally got around to seeing this movie, and man, it's tough to watch. The whole time, you know where the movie is headed, but you still can't prepare yourself for the emotional wallop when it happens. Hilary Swank is one of the best actors out there - she plays the tough trailer park girl perfectly, and Clint Eastwood is at his understated best. Morgan Freeman plays exactly the same role he did in Shawshank Redemption, and again it works for him. But I think the story is what makes this movie work. Inspiration followed by devastation. Would be curious as to what foes of euthanasia have to say about this one.
