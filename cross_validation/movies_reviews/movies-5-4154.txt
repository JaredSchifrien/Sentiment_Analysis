This is a better movie for adults than for children. I think it is a little too scary in some spots for kids. That being said, it is a great movie and a perfect adaptation of the novel, Charlie and The Chocolate Factory. Gene Wilder is perfectly cast as Wonka and the collection of child actors is wonderful. It's kind of amazing, given the quality of their performances, that they were largely never heard from again.
