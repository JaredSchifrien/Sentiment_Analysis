Now I can see why to some this might be offensive, but I like South Park I think it's a clever and funny show and the movie was no exception. To make it better it was written as a musical and Parker and Stone went after Canada- sheer genius!(btw I do like Canada) I could not stop laughing at the Uncle(you know what) song. Clever, with lots of laughs but not for everyone.
