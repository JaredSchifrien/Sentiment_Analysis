FANTASTIC!! This movie will be used in abnormal psych classes for years to come due to its remarkable portrayal of schizophrenia. This disorder is sorely misunderstood and this movie shows it is not just a skid row problem. Russell Crowe was flawless and Jennifer Connelly earned her Oscar (although I thought her co-star in Requiem for a Dream had an equally compelling performance).
