I seen this for the first time last night. Don't get me wrong, this movie is really bad. Its flat out horrible. Its so truly terrible, that it made a good comedy rather than a horror film. Watching a half dead woman run all over the place in the middle of the night away from a mad man in a leather face with a chainsaw blazing through the air is one of the most best pieces of comedy Ive seen. Reccomended for comedy and distrubing material. I haven't seen any of the sequels, but I hope to see them this coming Friday.
