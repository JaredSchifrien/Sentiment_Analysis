The Matrix is one of the coolest movies ever. Try watching it w/ the sound down and Crystal Method's Las Vegas over it. Amazing...almost Pink Floyd- Wizard of Oz . Beautiful visual images and a story line that doesn't really overwhelm. I loved it and I thought Keanu Reeves was excellent! Truely one of the greats.
