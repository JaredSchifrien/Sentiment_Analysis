Ben Hur is the classic tale of one man's spiritual quest and the hell he had to endure to complete it. It is also a deeply moving and masterful tribute by author Lew Wallace to faith, love and salvation as well as one of the best and most enduring examples of Christian fiction ever written. I'm not a big Heston fan, but I have to admit he really did an excellent job in this film. In what was possibly the best role of his career he took Judah Ben Hur on a very believable journey from the lofty heights of a wealthy aristocrat to the depths of a galley slave and back again. I watch this movie every time I have a chance and each time I do I find it - and especially the final scenes - as moving as I did the first time.
