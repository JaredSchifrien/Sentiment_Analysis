Still the King of Kongs and about fifty bazillion times better than the one that is currently playing at a theater near you. Jackson's film is certainly a lot better than the piece of crap that came out in the late seventies but transparent computerized special effects and a hundred extra minutes of story add nothing to this one-of-a-kind spectacular film. Don't let the acting performances or the thirties style dialogue sway your opinion, (they actually add greatly to the allure of the original) the special effects, featuring stop-action footage, are vastly superior than the souless art that we now let machines create for us. Oh yeah, and Faye Wray looked ten times better than the chick in the new flick.
