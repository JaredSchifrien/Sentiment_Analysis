i thought this movie was great. i expected it to suck, like everyone else did, but it's so funny, in a dark sort of way. It made me laugh a lot. A great look into the cutthroat world of Children's entertainment. Makes yoou think what kind of Bribes Barney must have been taking during his supreme reign...
