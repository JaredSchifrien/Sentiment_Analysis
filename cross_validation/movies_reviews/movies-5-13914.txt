What a captivating, compelling military drama which is nearly perfect in every department. A solid story and phenominal acting alone makes this film worth watching. Jack Nicholson gave his best performance ever in this film, delivering those famous lines: You can't handle the truth! . His acting prior to and after saying that was just so intense and phenominal it makes me wonder why he didn't win the Oscar. Tom Cruise was also at the top of his game, and he was equally intense in the famous courtroom scene with Jack Nicholson. This truly is a drama that will thrill you and keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Unmissable!
