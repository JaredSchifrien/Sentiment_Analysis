This movie is such a far cry from the in your face, heartstopping, blood chilling, action filled franchise that it takes it's name from it could almost be a spinoff. I did NOT like this film at all. The whole gentler-kinder misunderstood alien angle (at least, that's what I got out of it) didn't do anything for me. This movie was bad enough to make me glad the Sigourney has said she'll never do a fifth. I'll keep my fingers crossed.
