The Star Wars franchise strikes back with a vengenance with The Phantom Menace. Featuring a young Obi-Wan and his trainer, they fight a new enemy named the Trade Federation. The special effects are amazing from the space battles, droid battles and the pod racing. Humor is provided from the amusing Jar-Jar Binks. Characters are well fleshed-out and have memorable dialogue. A great ending and a great movie overall. Second in the Star Wars franchise only to Attack of the Clones.
