IMAGINE going to CATHOLIC SCHOOL for twelve years, being a SENIOR in an ALL BOYS HIGH SCHOOL and after all that RELIGIOUS INDOCTRINATION you see THE EXORCIST!!! Four of us went to Westwood Calif. on a rain misty night. We stood in line over two hours just to buy tickets and another two hours to get in the theater! The line rapped around the block twice! On the building was a window with the curtains blowing outward. People were handing out flyers saying what happened to REGAN could HAPPEN TO YOU!! Once inside my best friend and I got just off center front row seats. The sound and picture were right in our face! I kid you not, when the exorcist walks in the house and that roaring scream, MAAARINNNN!!!!, blares out, I rose and hovered over my seat for at least seven seconds!!! I couldn't sleep. Curses and loud noises bothered me. The next day my principle, a brother(I was taught by NUNS, PRIESTS and BROTHERS) asked me why I looked so pail. I tole him and he tole me to read BEGONE SATAN, the true story of an EXORCISM! That didn't help.What a head trip this film is, psychological horror that will beat the slasher film anytime.
