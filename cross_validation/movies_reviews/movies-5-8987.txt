I definatly enjoyed this movie. It was a hilarious carry movie. It had many well thought out jokes that mad the audiance laugh out load. I know that i would definatly see this again. Every person that I talked to that has seen this movie enjoyed it alot. Jim Carry plays a comic, but not Stupid, roll that makes you laugh. Jennifer Aniston also has a good roll and she helps carry the movie along. I think all true Carry fans would enjoy this one, and even if your not its a really good movie.
