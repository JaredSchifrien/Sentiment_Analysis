For anyone who has worked in the computer division of a large company can appreciate the humor in this movie. I loved this movie. We all know the boss, Bill Lumberg, the woman in the cubicle next to us with the most annoying voice, the memo's that everyone but you got, etc... Alot of mindless humor, but also some intelligent things, you just have to be smart enough to catch it.
