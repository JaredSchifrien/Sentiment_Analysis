i both loved and hated this movie. it really was the beginning of modern hollywood. the detail was remarkable: makeup, costumes, sound, fake backgrounds. everything was so detailed and controlled. and it had a believable and historic plot. i also liked the obvious homo-erotic twist of the adoring kid. the director was clearly gay, that tough guy hollywood was based on this is a true irony. i hated it because it set the pace for sentimental crap that now prevails from hollywood. i am very glad to see the kevin costner reference, it is so true.
