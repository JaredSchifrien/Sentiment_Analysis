This movie is more than great, it's genius. Not so much spooky as funny this movie will keep you lauging. And the suprisingly catchy phrases of Ash are great. Basically a remake of the first Evil Dead , Ash returns to the same cabin in the woods. One of my personal favorites. Watch this with Return of the living dead and a big donut.
