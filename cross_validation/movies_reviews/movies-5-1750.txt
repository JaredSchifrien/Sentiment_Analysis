Exceptional piece of cinema art. Intriguing, intelligent, beautifully shot and exhausting. This film requires and demands your utmost attention if you are to gain a fully comprehensive understanding. This picture is executed with with real feeling and complemnented by haunting sounds and ambience. One question, how does Shelby know his wife is dead and how does he know he has this 'condition' if he cannot create new memories after the accident? (Shelby can learn basic physical motions through systematic repition but I don't think this applies in this case)
