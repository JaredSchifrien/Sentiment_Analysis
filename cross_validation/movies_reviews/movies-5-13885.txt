this is one of those movies I did not want to see but was glad I did. A young man named Rocky who is a boxer. Is chosen to play against Apollo Creed a professional boxer. I loved the fact that this was a movie about the underdog. Sylvester Stallone was very good as Rocky and he wisely showed the human side of Rocky.With his dertimination to work out to be a good boxer. Hs crush on a woman and his dating her.I found myelf realing caring about this character and rooting for him.a very well done movie.
