Very, very good sci fi film. Its not a wham bam here's all the action at once. This film develops slowly and has hooks in it that make you jump out of your seat and keeps your eyes glued to the screen at the same time! The music is great, the SFX aren't particularly good, but it makes up for it with the acting, plot and the designs of HR Giger. The acting is great and I can watch this film over and over again.
