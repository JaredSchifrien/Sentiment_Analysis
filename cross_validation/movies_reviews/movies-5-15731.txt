This is a gripping, fast-paced movie rife with thought-provoking layers. Al Pacino is simply superb! The writer and director have successfully translated a seemingly dry subject matter and made it quite interesting. The 2hr and 30 minute movie explores all the moral and corporate dilemmas faced by the main characters without getting bogged-down in minutia. The piece moves quickly, builds to a climax, and immerses the viewer in the full complexity of the decisions made by all the participants. With the subtlety of a sledgehammer, this movie drives home the impact media company mergers have on the quality of news and information we all receive. The Insider has Best Picture written all over it.
