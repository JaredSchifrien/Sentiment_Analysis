Worst movie I've endured in a L O N G time WHEW. Talk about a mangled attempt at rewriting the old rehash from TOTAL RECALL. What a monumental waste of time and money to produce this garbage. Nothing makes remotely any sense whatsover. Arnold looks bored and stiff, no other actor adds anything worth watching. FX are cold and lifeless just like the horrid script. People around me were making 'lots of bathroom trips' hoping no doubt this turkey would at some point get better, it never did. This is one of those rare movie BOMBS where you just wish you had your ticket money back !! -----Todd Michael Wiseman Ohio Univ College of Film Cinematograpy
