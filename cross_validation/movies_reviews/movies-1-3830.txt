A friend and I got together and hacked this movie to absolute pieces. Anyone over 12 years old that thinks this film was worth 10 cents is delirious. This was an embarrassment and a poor effort to detail on the director's part. Way, way out there and far fetched! Hand-to-hand combat while aboard a motorcycle going 100 mph, come on now! The acting was poor and almost hilarious at times, even though this film was not supposed to be a comedy. Just an absolute waste of time. -1 star would be a gift for this nonsense!
